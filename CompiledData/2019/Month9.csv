i’m applying to a few all girls liberal arts schools that i’m really interested in (smith and wellesley), the environment seems perfect for me and i love the idea of learning and living in the absence of cis males. i am worried about questioning my gender and possibly realizing that i’m non-binary while im going to college. 

has anyone had experience with that? should i be concerned about applying there? i really like the schools, but im just not sure how my experience there might be if i figure out my gender identity

4,2019-09-01 01:30:33,cy3xgz,2,16,"Two words: Walmart clearance.

So today I went to Walmart and I ended up purchasing, between other random feminine clothing items, two tank tops, and only upon cashing at self-checkout did I realize that one came from the girls' section and the other from the boys' section, which at least explained why the tags said they were different sizes but I could clearly see with my own eyes that they were about the same size. I'm 16 and on the smaller side, so I fairly often fit 10-12 size shirts. It was only when I got home and tried on all of these clothes did I get to the two tank tops: a green one from the boys' section and a yellow one from the girls'. 

Upon trying on the girls' tank top, I noticed it fits about as expected and still finds my curves in the way that clothing geared towards female-bodied people does. The green tank has a different neckline and slightly different cut that I could notice and I preferred how that one fit, which makes me wonder if it's just the idea that it is supposed to be a masculine piece of clothing that intrigues me or if I genuinely thought it looks better on me. I feel like it's a combination of both. Anyway, I bound my chest and put the green tank top back on, and that shirt made me feel more comfortable and more confident than any other article of clothing I purchased today.

This brings me back to a certain dilemma. I sometimes wonder why it is this cheap green tank from the boys' section could make me feel more like myself and more confident than my very favorite pair of heels: a pair of burgundy combat boots that I love to bits. I loved them from the first time I ever laid eyes on them on a thrift shop rack, and I immediately knew that I needed those shoes to be mine, and not only are they very comfortable, but as a concept, I am in love with these shoes. When I put them on, for a moment it really does feel like I look good and I _feel_ good when I'm walking in them, but those heels never made me feel as confident as putting on that green tank top today. It makes me wonder if I feel more genuinely confident in masculinity because I have some preconceived notion of what femininity is or should be.

I've been dressing particularly fem lately, trying to dress in the ways I think I would like to, but on that note I tend to only feel confident in being feminine when I dissociate myself from it. I only really feel pretty if I sort of pretend the person in the mirror is some other person — some other girl — and perhaps that is why I tend to stray away from my face when taking pictures of myself and viewing myself because it is easier to picture that I'm someone else who _is_ very confident and self-assured and feels as if this is the right role for them. And this works decently well when I'm in the right frame of mind, which, as it stands, I am, but it doesn't feel as natural and it does oftentimes feel somewhat rehearsed. Even on its best days, it never truly feels like me and still causes me to pause and think through my life through the lens of, “Is this I want to be and present myself as?” 

So then that brings me to the question of am I looking for some kind of escape from what I believe society would expect from me as a girl or a woman, or am I genuinely just more content in gender nonconformity for my own personal reasons that there is no great amount of depth to? Why is it that I prefer the green tank top aside from just I like the way it fits me? 

I may never truly get the answer to this question that I would like to, and I wouldn't say I've _accepted_ that, but I would say that I don't believe I have the energy at this point in time to devote to giving this more thought because I have spent _so_ many hours thinking about this in my lifeand what it is going to turn out like and if I am wasting my time. If I'll somehow be hurting myself and/or other people by somehow choosing to present between lines. If I am a complete liar for saying that I genuinely wish at times to just not have to be a girl, and not necessarily because I am expected to be a girl, but because when I look in the mirror, it's not me that I am staring at but rather a female shell that I've been given.

This is a far longer post than I intended it to be, but here we are. Atleast I can say that I've gotten all of my thoughts out of my head, so perhaps I will be able to sleep okay tonight, but that might be too much to expect.",NonBinary,"Do I prefer masculinity because I have problems with expections of feminity, or is it really not that deep?",1567326633.0,"{'created_utc': 1567301433, 'id': 'cy3xgz', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 16, 'selftext': ""Two words: Walmart clearance.\n\nSo today I went to Walmart and I ended up purchasing, between other random feminine clothing items, two tank tops, and only upon cashing at self-checkout did I realize that one came from the girls' section and the other from the boys' section, which at least explained why the tags said they were different sizes but I could clearly see with my own eyes that they were about the same size.

I’m an AFAB NB that’s pretty pronoun apathetic, but I’m quickly realizing that’s making it difficult for me to own my gender representation as a new teacher for a few reasons: 
- honorifics are a must here, and while I’ve tried to use Mx., it’s really not catching on. Kids usually call me “Miss!”  without even using my last name 
-I have 32FF breasts and don’t usually experience physical dysphoria, so a lot of my wardrobe, while inspired by men’s fashion, doesn’t exactly hide my breasts. This was no obstacle to coworkers respecting my gender identity in my office-jobs, but it’s meant that kids and adults automatically gender me publicly in the classroom/hallways.
- about half my students come from monolingual Spanish-speaking households. I speak Spanish, but have not found a gender- neutral honorific to introduce myself by that translates. 
- 99% of the adults at the school are either overtly or casually transphobic and homophobic. The only one I’ve found that doesn’t seem to mind luckily is right next door, but he doesn’t really understand what NB even means and doesn’t seek understanding. (I.e. We’re both team “who-cares-what-the-kids-wear” and “boys vs girls activities are outdated and trite”, but he doesn’t seem to have a concept of genderqueerness of any kind, and thinks any advocacy is probably too risky/not worth it.
- The fact that we have a super old building with no gender-neutral restrooms for students and gender-segregated teacher’s lounges (!!)doesn’t help at all. 


Any advice on...?
- how I can better represent myself as the genderqueer and queer person I am without getting in trouble/ losing valuable relationships with the transphobic/ homophobic staff (I usually wouldn’t care what coworkers think, but I’m fresh out of college and working in a very low-income school where I’m going to need all the help I can get, and everyone is honestly so kind aside from the aggressive gendering and willing to help me with anything) 
- how I can be a better advocate for trans rights (and create a safe space for all LGBTQ+ students) living in the great state of Texas despite the “No Homo Promo” laws 
- how I can push back against the school’s transphobic culture in subtle yet meaningful ways (from what I gather, 95% of the staff seams to justify transphobic thinking with Black Church culture, which seems to be a key feature in the school’s  culture. As one of 4 non-black staff members (the only Asian) and the only non-Christian staff member, I want to respect whatever community solidarity underlines these attitudes because it seems to help keep the kids in school, but I still want to undermine these harmful transphobic beliefs )

I know that’s a lot but tl;dr: being a racial, religious, gender, and sexual minority, how do I advocate for myself and others as an NB teacher when my coworkers and students readily gender me, without jeopardizing  crucial relationships with transphobic staff or disrupting their interpretation of the Black Church culture which seems beneficial to student retention rates on-face?

However. For the past 5 years I've been becoming steadily closer to my boyfriend's family, most notably his dad. I've become very close friends with his dad. I was close friend's with my bf's sister before I got with my bf and she is very accepting of me. My bf is bi and is chill with any transitioning. But his dad. It's so frustrating because he is genuinely a good, kind, compassionate person. Very accepting usually. But he doesn't get trans or enby folx. It's fucking painful, really. I've explained myself to him but said I do need to work through some stuff. So he said (in a kind way) ""I hope you find yourself soon"" and I said I have found myself, I just have to work through some of my more toxic thoughts that are the result of bottling my feelings for so many years. This was at the start of last week. Then near the end of the week we were standing outside a shop with their dog, waiting for my friend and bf to come out (no pun intended), and he said ""so you found yourself and you're straight, yeah?""

And I do agree with that, BUT NOT IN THIS CONTEXT AHHHHGH. I have changed in so many ways, but one way I have not changed is in being trans. It's like how he has never stopped loving art and film. Bad comparison, but you get my point. Sometimes people just don't change about certain things. He's even used the slur ""tr\*\*ny"" jokingly about some dumb Mii on the Switch me and my bf made, but me, my bf and my friend all spoke up about him using the slur. I think he thought we were being over the top though. It's so frustrating because he's pretty damn liberal and accepting apart from this.

I'm totally new to this whole community and I haven't really come out about my new identity, my fiance kinda knows and she is so very understanding, not something I ever expected of her. Anyway why I'm here is because I don't really have any LGBT+ friends, it's just me and my girl, I really miss having community ya know? But even then, I've never been a part of the enby community before and I think it's what I really need. 

Let me give y'all some background on me.   I came out as a lesbian at 15, at 16 after reading a particularly good webcomic I started question my gender, What I really a female lesbian? Or was I actually a straight male? I did a lot of research and concluded that no, penis is icky and therefore I must be just a female lesbian. Skip ahead to 26 and on a long car ride with my girl we got on to the discussion of gender. We were right in the middle of Australia campaigning for marriage equality and gender was suddenly thrown into the limelight and not just male or female. 

It was during this discussion that I realised that I don't identify as a lady or woman, but girl is ok. 

3 years later (8 weeks ago) and whilst in the middle of having a mental break about my partner desperately wanting to be poly I saw an article on Facebook about Non-binary people taking T to feel more like themselves. It struck a chord with me, like everything suddenly fell into place but also suddenly everything got really confusing. Who was I? 

So I went into research mode again but this time there's so much more information and it's helped me so much more than 12 years ago. Reddit has been such a big help. I can finally say that I'm happy with who I am. Yes I have some mild body disphoria but I am happy knowing that I no long identify as a female lesbian. I'm an enby queer and proud of it. 

Now I just have to work out how to tell my friends..

I was assigned female at birth, and always identified as female for as long as I could remember, but I remember moments during my childhood when I wanted to be a boy instead of a girl and even voicing these wants. However the want wasn’t always there, just sometimes, but when it was I remember it was strong. I still get the feeling sometimes, but I don’t voice it out loud anymore.

I look at myself, and I find I hate my boobs. Not in a “oh they don’t look the way I want them too,” way, but in a “I wish they didn’t exist” way. 

And the few times I’ve been either mistaken for a boy or had people unsure of my gender actually made me feel happy instead of offended or annoyed. I even recently had a dream where I accidentally ran (literally) into a group of girls playing basketball (don’t ask me why I was anywhere near a basketball court in my dream when I have 0 athletic abilities in real life lol) and they couldn’t tell if I was a boy or a girl, and when they asked my dream self said “neither.”

So to wrap things up, I’m not exactly sure what I should do or how to process this. Coming out is out of the question at the moment (parents would accept me, but I can’t guarantee my grandparents, my aunty, or my stepparents and their families will, and while I could live without my stepfamily members if I had to, I can’t live without my grandparents or my aunty; I love them too much to risk losing them).

203,2019-09-04 21:41:30,czr9hd,1,4,"A thought that's been bouncing around my head recently is what if agender isn't so much a gender identity to me so much as a statement of how my assigned sex makes me feel? 

^also works as tl;dr. You can skip the rest. 

To me the feeling of being agender comes from two logical angles - a sense of detachment from my assigned gender because I don't feel it represents who I am and a sense of detachment from the opposite because it's not how I was raised and socialised. Ultimately I don't know if my utter apathy and sense of disconnect from my gender is an identity unto itself or simply dysphoria in its own right and a sign that I'm actually FtM. 

So I thought I would for and against this in a long form rather than bullet point way. But essentially:

Agender: disconnect from the idea of gender. No sense of connection to either sex or a combination. Lack of a strong drive to masculinise or feminise myself. This is how I feel either as a cause or consequence of my gender.

However. FtM: I enjoy packing and binding. Unlike many other AFAB NB people I've seen discuss what theyd like or dislike about HRT I don't feel averse to the idea of changes on testosterone, bottom growth included. My ideal body type is something like male ballerina or figure skater but part of what makes it so tantalising is that I feel so close to it (I'm maybe quarter decently androgynous). Gender euphoria is always triggered by in some way being seen or seeing myself or planning to see myself as more male. I struggle to see myself in NB people. On the other hand I don't feel male enough to be male or female enough to be female. I see butch women as more masculine than me in their presentation but also more woman than me - connected to both their body and their presentation in a way I'm not. But I'm not sure I see myself in ftm people either, or cis people. Yet I feel joy in spotting people who I feel look like 'the male version of me' even before I'd ever discovered trans content.

There is an agender youtuber called Chandler who is transitioning on T. To first glance from me they read as completely male now. So I guess it's possible for an agender person to want to transition and appear male without feeling or identifying as male. 

Some further notes: I feel 99% of the time unable to look good as a woman or as a man without HRT. Even when I recognise in some photos I look objectively good as a woman it doesn't give me affirmative pleasure: 'that's me looking great' so much as 'yeah that objectively looks good'. When I see more masculine photos of me it's more complex. Something I like and something I don't. In the moment I tend to feel good about the photos only to feel somehow disappointed later, like I missed something. 

Maybe I'm just a bit of a disassociative person who will never see themself in photos. Or mirrors. Or recall events afterwards as if I was really there rather than dreaming. Sometimes I think maybe it's depression, but I know I do feel happy fairly often in fact, I just don't relate to it afterwards. As though it happened to someone else. Perhaps it's a coping strategy from my youth that never left and consumed my gender with it.

I'm occasionally filled with both excitement and terror at the thought of being ftm. The thought of being agender fills me with the same deep apathy that my assigned gender already does. But perhaps that's precisely because it's who I am. Perhaps that's because it's what's normal or right and I'm just chasing a high thrill that isn't an actual reality I want. I mean, I do enjoy being invisible. It allows me to get away with being effeminate and gesticulating and liking soft things and men and discussing feelings more easily should the mood strike. People know me as this body and this voice and this name. 

Then there's the asexuality. If dysphoria is the cause of it (my narrative doesn't gel with many other asexuals as I don't feel repulsed by it in general or by touching another person (I can get aroused making out) but I simply cannot get into getting naked myself and being touched, especially There and There.) then that might add plus one to the gender dysphoria column. I remember suggesting to a friend even before I discovered trans content that I might enjoy sex in a male body. But perhaps I simply have a 'yaoi kink' that I cannot now undo. Even if I were to transition FtM it would not be cis male organs I would be working with, meaning dysphoria would likely keep me asexual but possibly even more frustrated even assuing I'm not just asexual anyway and would have felt the same had I been born as a cis man. Who knows. 

So my conclusion is basically that I have no conclusion, and even if I found one it would be an impossible choice to make. My dysphoria (if that's what it is) is too low to really merit significant transition steps, but too noticeable for me to completely ignore it now it's been pointed out. I'm too comfortable with my social role to eagerly change it but just uncomfortable enough to feel that this comfy spot was never really mine. I'm too practical for they/them, too physically distant from he/him, but have no resonance with she/her.

I don't think there's a good solution. Perhaps my best shot is simply to forge ahead with my life as best I can, disconnected from myself as I am, disembodied pilot that I am, and just do my best through hobbies and hard work. If only I could find the motivation and energy to forge myself a future. But I'm not depressed. I can focus if I have to and I can get out of bed and even enjoy hobbies and laugh. I guess if I'm not depressed though I'm just being pathetic. 

I spiral too easy and get melodramatic too easy. Gross. I should just get off the internet and or delete this post. Yeah. I'll do that. Gender is the least of my problems. I'll leave it up a little while though. It took a while to write after all.

My ideal body type is something like male ballerina or figure skater but part of what makes it so tantalising is that I feel so close to it (I'm maybe quarter decently androgynous). Gender euphoria is always triggered by in some way being seen or seeing myself or planning to see myself as more male. I struggle to see myself in NB people. On the other hand I don't feel male enough to be male or female enough to be female. I see butch women as more masculine than me in their presentation but also more woman than me - connected to both their body and their presentation in a way I'm not. But I'm not sure I see myself in ftm people either, or cis people. Yet I feel joy in spotting people who I feel look like 'the male version of me' even before I'd ever discovered trans content.\n\nThere is an agender youtuber called Chandler who is transitioning on T. To first glance from me they read as completely male now. So I guess it's possible for an agender person to want to transition and appear male without feeling or identifying as male. \n\nSome further notes: I feel 99% of the time unable to look good as a woman or as a man without HRT. Even when I recognise in some photos I look objectively good as a woman it doesn't give me affirmative pleasure: 'that's me looking great' so much as 'yeah that objectively looks good'. When I see more masculine photos of me it's more complex. Something I like and something I don't. In the moment I tend to feel good about the photos only to feel somehow disappointed later, like I missed something. \n\nMaybe I'm just a bit of a disassociative person who will never see themself in photos. Or mirrors. Or recall events afterwards as if I was really there rather than dreaming. Sometimes I think maybe it's depression, but I know I do feel happy fairly often in fact, I just don't relate to it afterwards. As though it happened to someone else. Perhaps it's a coping strategy from my youth that never left and consumed my gender with it.\n\nI'm occasionally filled with both excitement and terror at the thought of being ftm. The thought of being agender fills me with the same deep apathy that my assigned gender already does. But perhaps that's precisely because it's who I am. Perhaps that's because it's what's normal or right and I'm just chasing a high thrill that isn't an actual reality I want. I mean, I do enjoy being invisible. It allows me to get away with being effeminate and gesticulating and liking soft things and men and discussing feelings more easily should the mood strike. People know me as this body and this voice and this name. \n\nThen there's the asexuality. If dysphoria is the cause of it (my narrative doesn't gel with many other asexuals as I don't feel repulsed by it in general or by touching another person (I can get aroused making out) but I simply cannot get into getting naked myself and being touched, especially There and There.) then that might add plus one to the gender dysphoria column. I remember suggesting to a friend even before I discovered trans content that I might enjoy sex in a male body. But perhaps I simply have a 'yaoi kink' that I cannot now undo. Even if I were to transition FtM it would not be cis male organs I would be working with, meaning dysphoria would likely keep me asexual but possibly even more frustrated even assuing I'm not just asexual anyway and would have felt the same had I been born as a cis man. Who knows. \n\nSo my conclusion is basically that I have no conclusion, and even if I found one it would be an impossible choice to make. My dysphoria (if that's what it is) is too low to really merit significant transition steps, but too noticeable for me to completely ignore it now it's been pointed out. I'm too comfortable with my social role to eagerly change it but just uncomfortable enough to feel that this comfy spot was never really mine. I'm too practical for they/them, too physically distant from he/him, but have no resonance with she/her.\n\nI don't think there's a good solution. Perhaps my best shot is simply to forge ahead with my life as best I can, disconnected from myself as I am, disembodied pilot that I am, and just do my best through hobbies and hard work. If only I could find the motivation and energy to forge myself a future. But I'm not depressed. I can focus if I have to and I can get out of bed and even enjoy hobbies and laugh. I guess if I'm not depressed though I'm just being pathetic. \n\nI spiral too easy and get melodramatic too easy. Gross. I should just get off the internet and or delete this post. Yeah. I'll do that. Gender is the least of my problems. I'll leave it up a little while though. It took a while to write after all. \n\nRight, time to get off my ass and cook some pasta."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Agender dysphoria?', 'created': 1567658490.0}"

AMAB enby discovering who I am at 30. Spent 16 years /w long hair and baggy clothing, believing that I couldn't feel good about the way I look, or that I had to learn to feel good looking masculine. I had a fair number of dreams as a teen that I had entirely female sex characteristics, \_(though also plenty where I didn't)\_ and throughout my life they'd come back from time to time, though less frequently. Used to steal my sister's clothes. Religious family that intermittently espoused some transphobic shit I think I internalized more than I'd like to admit.

Fast-forward to now, been talking to a close friend about the same age who recently very quietly came out as non-binary. Been chatting /w my partner/fiance about how I used to wear her/my sister's clothes, was less overtly masculine, how I seem to fixate on trans women and trans issues, etc... There was a long list, mostly stuff I hadn't noticed myself.

The precipitating event for this was when I gave myself a very stereotypically male haircut. Did it because I'm losing my hair and it's totally unmanageable due to thinness. I thought I would feel better not having a wiry, wispy mess of hair, but looking at myself in the mirror made me feel awful. My partner \_(we've been together for over a decade, so she knows me pretty well)\_ suggested this might be gender dysphoria, which lead to the aforementioned series of discussions about gender identity.

Talking about this and realizing that I've never really identified /w masculinity and have been forcing it for so long was really freeing and empowering. Or at least, I thought it was. Been doing a lot of stuff \_(/w my partner mostly)\_ that I've actively avoided for so long- trying on her clothes, shaving my body hair, got piercings. Doing this stuff feels really great, and even though I'm not perfectly happy with how I look, I've been feeling more confident than I've felt in ages. Maybe ever. And my partner is so supportive that I tear up just thinking about it.

There's a catch, though. Every time I do something affirming, I feel a little more sick when I look in the mirror, or see my reflection in glass. I've been being hit with waves of what I guess is dysphoria every day, and I swear they're getting worse. I oscillate between feeling ok and like I'm almost fine /w looking like a guy sometimes to being absolutely miserable when I look at myself. Today it was so intense that it was all I could do to keep from breaking down crying. I can't remember feeling like this. I wanted to claw my way out of my own skin.

I don't know what I feel like anymore, and I don't even know how I can feel like this now. Can I really have repressed this for over 15 years? Is this everything coming out at once? Am I going to feel better eventually? I feel like I uncorked something in my head and now it's screaming at me constantly.

I'm not sure I feel female, but I feel so strongly that I do not feel male. I think non-binary describes how I feel. Bottom surgery has no appeal to me. I don't feel weird about not having breasts. But I hate my body hair. I hate it so much I spent an hour and a half removing it and it's the best I've ever felt, even though I'm itchy and bleeding and covered in bumps. I hate that I accumulate so much fatty tissue near my middle, but I can \_sort of\_ reconcile with that.

I hate that my hairline is receding, I hate that I look like my male relatives, I hate that know exactly how I'm going to go bald, I hate that my face isn't more feminine, and I absolutely loathe how it all comes together to create something that feels perfectly alien and repulsive to me.

I don't know what any of this means, and I sure as hell don't know what to do about it.

I don't want to think about HRT because intellectually I suspect that it will actually be counterproductive and the side-effects would probably cause me and my partner a great deal of emotional pain. I honestly can't even bring myself to research it because I don't want to travel down a confirmation-bias-shaped road to a place I won't be able to get my head out of.

I'm so scared. Part of me wants to put the genie back in the bottle, but I think I sailed past that a week or so ago.

I just want someone to tell me that 30 is too late to start hormone therapy and that it's a bad idea and that I should just wait and see how I feel and that everything is going to be fine and I'm eventually going to feel better about presenting as ""male"" sometimes and that I can somehow balance all of this and not end up screwing up my life. I want to believe that I will be able to see my reflection and not feel like I'm seeing some kind of cruel joke.

Most of all though, I want to stop obsessing over this. I just want to hit the pause button on all this gender identity shit until I get the rest of the crazy shit in my life dealt with. I can't imagine a worse time to be confronting all of this.

Can't I just like, stop and pick this back up in like 3 months or so? Please?

IDK. I just want to feel normal. I thought I felt fine a week or two ago. Why did wearing a few dresses, getting my ears pierced, and shaving my body take me from 0 to total-breakdown-identity-crisis territory in a hot minute? Is this normal?

When I think about myself and who I am, I never feel like I'm male or female I just feel like I'm myself and that's how I want to be viewed.

 When it comes to fashion, my fashion sense is pretty neutral, leaning more to the masc side of things though. My hair, again, is also pretty neutral, it's short and messy but leans a bit more to the fem side. (Ik choosing to dress or style yourself in a fem, masc, or neutral way is just preference and doesn't change your gender identity but I thought I would mention it.)

 I feel very uncomfortable and ashamed of having breasts, I try to make them appear flatter by wearing sports bras (that I only remove to shower) and I avoid clothing that would accentuate them.(Tight and clingy fabrics or low cut shirts) Having a period sucks as well, I know anyone can have one but, it's viewed as such a womanly thing that I feel like I shouldn't have one.

It feels weird and silly to call myself a woman, or a lady, or a girl but I don't mind being called she/her pronouns. It's what I've always been called and I don't really care, although I do find it funny when I'm called or told to act like a woman,lady,girl,miss,etc. 

When it comes to being called they/them no one has ever called me that but I wouldn't mind being called that either. 

However, I don't like being called he/him, I've had people call me he/him in a negative way before and it would just seem off putting to be called he/him. 

(Pronouns are also a sort of non issue with me because they don't really come up for me that often. I'm either called by name,nickname, or dude and my gender has never been a point of discussion with my friends or family.)

I also feel conflicted on calling myself non-binary or anything other than cis-gender because, besides my issues with my period and breasts, I don't think I really experience a lot of gender dysphoria ~~plenty of body dysmorphia tho lmao~~. (My chest especially is a huge issue for me but idk)

that said, unfortunately dysphoria is now a big part of my life again and i’m feeling it almost nonstop. i wish i was amab so i could have my ideal body type (although that in and of itself would bring new kinds of dysphoria). i wish i was taller and that i had a masculine body type that was still somewhat feminine. i think i’d look more that way if i was very thin but losing weight would be impossible without methods that would damage my health. i wanted to go on t so i can be androgynous but i’m scared that i’ll be gendered as a guy so i’ve almost given up on the idea. maybe microdosing is an option, i don't know. everything about me is very feminine and cute and i think if i was a cis woman i’d feel much more confident and happy. yet instead i feel incredibly awful and uncomfortable because of dysphoria and knowing that those cute qualities are what gender me as a girl for most people. i feel like i can’t appreciate how i look at all.

251,2019-09-05 19:59:46,d05xvl,0,13,"So I've not kept my sliding gender or increased confusion a secret from my NB friend. Today in little ways they suggested I could choose the male avatar when I was making us a sim household and also that I was jokingly the husband when I mentioned I'd jokingly labelled them under wife in our uni days together.

Another thing is that in picking my sim's voice pitch (my voice is low for an AFAB) they helped me by recording me voice and playing it back to me. And I was shocked how low it was. When I've recorded it myself at home I've usually found it either high or sort of neutral but I know when I relax it drops even lower and I'm more comfortable with my friend than at home wondering if my housemates will overhear me talking. But I also know that I disassociate from my higher range. My surprise at my low voice was just sort of a sudden surprise and I couldn't tell what I really thought or if it was negative or positive. It was mostly just: wow, that's lower than I remember it being. Is it just me that hears it that low? But it's not like I want a higher one.

The other thing is, I've tried choosing the male body type in sims 3 before. And I didn't really prefer it, although that may just be because the avatar didn't really end up looking how I imagine the male version of me. I didn't really connect with this female one either although I recognised they looked somewhat? more like me. 

When I'm expecting it or leading the convo with gender non conforming jokes like I'm such a dad friend or whatever it feels okay or good, but when others say it feels sort of mildly alarming. Sort of a shit this is real? Is this real? That could mean anything.

It might be that anything other than androgyny with just an edge of safe cis leaning passing makes me uncomfortable. It might be that I prefer as close to androgyny as I can possibly get. 

I think I'm averse to the idea of being NB as much as I accept it's likely. It seems so nebulous. A gender on a cloud. I came out as months ago to said friend as agender but I don't think I've really been able to process or accept it. I think I could more easily accept being binary trans in a certain sense, but am more afraid of it in another. As it is, it sort of feels like I've lost my gender and I feel very untethered. And right now as I think about it and test it more in small ways I'm very aware that it's missing. I would like to connect with my assigned sex or with the opposite; to be left drifting feels odd.

There's a last test I can try. I will find an LGBT group and try he/him pronouns and a male name for long enough to really see how I feel about it.

But I'm afraid that in the end I really may be a 'they'. And if it's always been true and my agender feeling is not just a symptom of a more binary desire, it's a weird feeling to be finally aware of. As much as I'm fine with the truth of NB people in general, I want to be sure that it's my personal truth. Then I'll go from there.

259,2019-09-05 22:52:00,d0858b,12,17,"Hello everyone!  


I've been wanting to make this post for around a year and a half. Finally, I made a new account to post this with. There's a lot I'm going to cover since I'm trying to get my thoughts straight. This is a huge and self-indulgent post. My experience with dysphoria &amp; gender has been... strange, and I've felt rather alone for a long time. I haven't met anyone I can truly relate to despite knowing many trans and nonbinary people throughout the years. If anyone here shares my experience, I'd love to hear! If you have any insight, it would also be greatly appreciated!  


**Body Dysphoria**

Despite my protests, I am AMAB. I've been on estradiol patches and a hormone blocker injection for 1.5 years. During this time I have moved a lot and struggled to stay on HRT consistently. My hormones have fluctuated greatly.

I have yet to get any surgeries but have three in mind: SRS, top surgery, and one notable face tweak.

My dysphoria is a sizeable lad and affects me daily. It's quite painful and at times debilitating. The main sources of my dysphoria are my genitalia, my face, being misgendered/deadnamed, and... my breasts. The universe has an ironic sense of humor.

Before starting HRT I was entirely unsure if I wanted breasts. I tried simulating having breasts but knew my true feelings could only surface after I grew my own. Prior to HRT I researched ways to take estrogen without chest growth, but it went nowhere. Starting estrogen was a leap of faith.

HahahA it hurts. I got a binder shortly after my chest started growing. The dysphoria hit harder than I could have anticipated. Feeling them grow in was disturbing. This coincided with a traumatic event around my chest, and I just... hated them. I felt way better overall from estrogen and knew I couldn't stop HRT, but this was something new to deal with.

I stopped binding for some time and tried to embrace my chest. Maybe I'd learn to love my breasts and how they made my profile more feminine. I felt ok about my chest for a good chunk of 2018. Never *good,* but I could manage. They never fully registered as a part of my body. During this time I tried presenting female and thought I'd ""finally accepted"" I'm ""just a trans woman.""

Nah. A couple of months ago I had a watershed moment with my gender &amp; presentation. My chest dysphoria came roaring back and now I'm binding daily. My ""male"" features still cause equally bad dysphoria, but my chest bothers me more often. It's the most visible and obtrusive dysphoric body part. I don't want people to see my chest or find it sexually desirable or anything. Considering I'm AMAB, it's hard to find anyone else with this experience. Trans women typically start HRT to *get* breasts and are often happy to have them. I find myself having to explain &amp; justify my dysphoria even to other trans people.

**Gender Fluctuation**

When I first realized I'm trans, I embraced being a girl &amp; a lesbian super hard online. It took time before I came out IRL. During this period I knew next to nothing about nonbinary people but started meeting some. I had a strange fascination with their way of being.

Eventually, I started going to a queer support group/hangout space and finally could be out IRL. This was huge for me. I met a ton of nonbinary people and started questioning myself again. When faced with the freedom to be a girl IRL, something felt off. I hadn't started HRT yet at this time and didn't know what was to come. At some point I went ""fuck it"" and began experimenting with androgynous presentation, binding, using ey/em pronouns, and a gender-neutral name. Being nonbinary felt freeing.

I met the first person I ever dated in that group, a lovely polygender enby. We had a confusing &amp; short-lived romance where neither of us knew what to call the other. There were no boyfriends or girlfriends involved! We stayed friends for a long time afterward, and I look back on our time together fondly.

HRT hit at some point and confirmed my suspicions about being gender-deviant. As time went on, though, I started missing girlhood. I got gender stage fright. Despite being around queer people IRL, I feared to embrace my femininity. It felt weak, vulnerable, and looked ""wrong"" on my still masculinized body. I still had a lot of male conditioning to contest with. That was a very angry time where being nonbinary genuinely was a ""safe"" purgatory before I could better accept myself.

Then something big happened. I met someone at a mock government event. They were agender and equal parts androgyny, beauty, and danger. We connected immediately and had a disastrous kerosene fire of a fling. This them fatale saw my desire for girlhood and femininity and downright *told* me to accept it. I wore a dress in public for the first time, to a big dance nonetheless. Despite their own nonbinary status, they felt justified in telling me I'm ""just a woman."" It was incredibly toxic and I got out, but the damage was done. I began presenting very feminine, using she/her, and eventually switched to a ""properly feminine"" name.

After escaping that abusive person, I fell into questioning my gender again. Despite trying on the nonbinary label again, I concluded it was ""time to grow up and accept the boring truth."" I was a trans woman and needed to learn to love my body. This got weird and I thought I was attracted to men for a while. Compulsive heterosexuality hit me hard for a time. I dressed Womanly and could feel good about it, but it never quite looked right. I'm now back to knowing myself as a lesbian, though.

Finally, I met a new friend in a new city. She's a trans woman and has studied gender variance a good bit. We started having Big Talks and eventually got to my gender history &amp; presentation. She hit me with the words ""You seem really butch,"" and it broke me. I cried for a few days. I finally accepted womanhood and femininity felt like transitioning into another mask.

**Where I'm At Now**

I don't know what to call myself and I'm tired of looking for labels. Nothing fits right. If look deep within myself for a Gender, I find nothing. I feel an emptiness where that part of me should be. It's comfortable in its own right.

""Man,"" ""he,"" and other male words hurt. I joke that I'm a twink, though, and like fucking around with ""boy,"" ""prince,"" and other playful masculine terms. I use she/her pronouns, though I'm curious about neopronouns like xey/xem. They/them does not feel like me. My current name is decidedly feminine, but I'm drawn to androgynous ones. I change my name every time I move cities it seems, and I've never been that tied to one. ""Woman,"" ""girl, and ""female"" feel off in some way, though ""girl"" is really cute and bothers me the least.

I am a lesbian and see myself in butch history, though I don't consider myself butch. I relate to trans guys, nonbinary people, and trans women in different ways. When I talk with trans guys we can complain about having tits. When I talk with trans women we can complain about having dicks. When I talk to enbies I feel the most understood. There's no community I feel truly at home in, though.

My presentation is androgynous-leaning-masculine, with sporadic genderfucked days. Usually I wear black skinny jeans, a binder, T-shirts, suspenders or a belt, vans or boots, a hat. I love jackets with big pockets and military-inspired clothing. Blue-collar butch is the lesbian aesthetic I resonate with most. When I feel like having fun I'll throw on a short skirt, knee socks, fishnets, and some light makeup, but keep the binder and often suspenders. I like looking androgynous &amp; confusing, and don't feel comfortable going full masc or femme. I bind underneath dresses if I wear them. My mannerisms are boyish and I'm generally quite confident and outgoing.

Many questions remain unanswered for me. What name do I really want? What pronouns? Do I *genuinely* want top surgery, or am I going to accept my body eventually? Is this just a phase? Will I get over myself someday and accept I'm just a trans woman? Why don't any words, names, or labels ever feel right?

Thank you for reading. Again, I would *love* to hear if you have any similar experiences. Your feedback and time is greatly appreciated. This post has been incubating for a long time. I've had a lot to get off my chest.",NonBinary,Weird Dysphoria / AMAB &amp; Nonbinary / Big Post Energy / Life Story,1567749120.0,"{'created_utc': 1567723920, 'id': 'd0858b', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 17, 'selftext': 'Hello everyone!  \n\n\nI\'ve been wanting to make this post for around a year and a half. Finally, I made a new account to post this with. There\'s a lot I\'m going to cover since I\'m trying to get my thoughts straight. This is a huge and self-indulgent post. My experience with dysphoria &amp; gender has been... strange, and I\'ve felt rather alone for a long time. I haven\'t met anyone I can truly relate to despite knowing many trans and nonbinary people throughout the years. If anyone here shares my experience, I\'d love to hear! If you have any insight, it would also be greatly appreciated!  \n\n\n**Body Dysphoria**\n\nDespite my protests, I am AMAB. I\'ve been on estradiol patches and a hormone blocker injection for 1.5 years. During this time I have moved a lot and struggled to stay on HRT consistently. My hormones have fluctuated greatly.\n\nI have yet to get any surgeries but have three in mind: SRS, top surgery, and one notable face tweak.\n\nMy dysphoria is a sizeable lad and affects me daily. It\'s quite painful and at times debilitating. The main sources of my dysphoria are my genitalia, my face, being misgendered/deadnamed, and... my breasts. The universe has an ironic sense of humor.\n\nBefore starting HRT I was entirely unsure if I wanted breasts. I tried simulating having breasts but knew my true feelings could only surface after I grew my own. Prior to HRT I researched ways to take estrogen without chest growth, but it went nowhere. Starting estrogen was a leap of faith.\n\nHahahA it hurts. I got a binder shortly after my chest started growing. The dysphoria hit harder than I could have anticipated. Feeling them grow in was disturbing. This coincided with a traumatic event around my chest, and I just... hated them. I felt way better overall from estrogen and knew I couldn\'t stop HRT, but this was something new to deal with.\n\nI stopped binding for some time and tried to embrace my chest. Maybe I\'d learn to love my breasts and how they made my profile more feminine. I felt ok about my chest for a good chunk of 2018. Never *good,* but I could manage. They never fully registered as a part of my body. During this time I tried presenting female and thought I\'d ""finally accepted"" I\'m ""just a trans woman.""\n\nNah. A couple of months ago I had a watershed moment with my gender &amp; presentation. My chest dysphoria came roaring back and now I\'m binding daily. My ""male"" features still cause equally bad dysphoria, but my chest bothers me more often. It\'s the most visible and obtrusive dysphoric body part. I don\'t want people to see my chest or find it sexually desirable or anything. Considering I\'m AMAB, it\'s hard to find anyone else with this experience. Trans women typically start HRT to *get* breasts and are often happy to have them. I find myself having to explain &amp; justify my dysphoria even to other trans people.\n\n**Gender Fluctuation**\n\nWhen I first realized I\'m trans, I embraced being a girl &amp; a lesbian super hard online. It took time before I came out IRL. During this period I knew next to nothing about nonbinary people but started meeting some. I had a strange fascination with their way of being.\n\nEventually, I started going to a queer support group/hangout space and finally could be out IRL. This was huge for me. I met a ton of nonbinary people and started questioning myself again. When faced with the freedom to be a girl IRL, something felt off. I hadn\'t started HRT yet at this time and didn\'t know what was to come.

I have recently identified as NB (last month or so) I have seen a psychologist, psychiatrist, will be seeing a 2nd psychiatrist soon to confirm body dysphoria, and possibly be on HRT in the future.

That all said, NB just felt like the most appropriate and fitting title to fall under for what I have always felt myself to be. Somewhere in-between, but not really genderfluid. Even when not having an official title back in the day and retrospectively looking at my surpressed emotions and depression surrounding my body up until now.

It even came up in my recent psychologist visit as they asked how i feel fully transitioning to female. 

My answer: ""Honestly no. Not at this time at least. Nut if i were to get GCS, i would be happy with that. If it evolves to fully transotioning, fine. But the V..et's go with the two scenarios, AMAB (which is the current situation) and AFAB. 

AMAB scenario, I dont want my plumbing. I can say that for sure. But to give myself the plumbing I want requires HRT for 1 year. Which if I develop breasts in the process... Fine. I have never liked my body or looks and I want to feel that. So if the HRT/breasts end up being a ""side effect"" of getting the plumbing i feel is correct for me, then I will handle that (binding or maybe surgery. 

In the AFAB scenario, I would buzz my hair shorter and get top surgery. 

Either way, i know I would not be happy as a male. And in the current AMAB scenario, I dont believe I would be happy fully transitioned and I will meed to be somewhere in-between.""

Psych: ""Alright, you sound confident and have past history of gender confusion and body dysphoria. Check out WPATH.""

I announced to my family as NB last month, but have not yet divulged the desire for surgery, or the process that requires HRT. 

There is a mix of excitement and anxiety over the potential horizon of GCS. But ultimately, to feel more comfortable in my own skin/body, GCS seems to be the way I need to go.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals transition into parenthood, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap.

***Stranger: But I see gender more like a biological thing, so if I would see myself as a girl for example i would still call myself a boy in a biological sense***

**Stranger:** If you know what i mean

(a very long conversation I just cut out of here)

**Stranger:** But It's such a complex topic

**You:** And exactly this can kill your whole mental health...getting told ,,You are still a boy / girl''

**Stranger:** Dont get me wrong

**You:** No I was meaning it in generall.

**Stranger:** Im really open to everything and I think It's really important that everything is tolerated in society

 **Stranger:** But I think what kills your mental health is not being told youre still a boy or girl, just your own mindset. Just learn not to give a shit about what people except you to be. Accept and love your biological sex but dont let anybody tell you what or who you should like 

 **Stranger:** Just be whoever you want to be. I just think that the biological sex is just a physical thing you cant just ignore 

 **Stranger:** Only physical as I said. Whatever is on your mind is not anyone else business 

&amp;#x200B;

*Guys he was extremly nice an pretty open minded I had fun talking to him :3 and I don't know if you know that ,,fear'' that someone uses the wrong pronouns in your absence so this happened:*

&amp;#x200B;

**Stranger:** Again I totally respect you and I know that It's not easy to cope with a society that can be pretty stuck up at times

**Stranger:** Im bi myself, I dont make a big deal outta it, who gives a shit. Just be whoever you want and feel comfortable with

**You:** Hey can I ask you a favor? If you ever happen to talk about me in any ways...could you use they/them pronouns (or none at all if you talk in German)

**Stranger:** Yeah sure

**You:** You can proably don't imagine how much this means to me....

&amp;#x200B;

*and then there was the BUT again...*

&amp;#x200B;

***Stranger: But again***

***Stranger: I know it means a lot to you but it really shouldnt***

***Stranger: You are making a big deal out of it but I think you should learn (even though it will take time) to stop caring. Otherwise youll just always find yourself being offended, even if the other person doesnt want to offend you in any way***

 ***Stranger: And also, I think you are still pretty young at (Age). Youll grow older and eventually youll be at a point where you dont care about other peoples opinions anymore, and at that point youll be fully comfortable with yourself*** *(Isn't that actually just the:,, it's a phase'' thing .-. and little me felt missunderstood .-.)*

 **You:** Well I don't know if you really understand it but I can tell that you try to 

**Stranger:** I probably cant, youre right

**Stranger:** But I think I can tell you some common stuff that is really important to every person on this planet

**Stranger:** Im probably making a fool out of myself right now I know

**Stranger:** I just try my best to share my view with you and if you think you can make something from it I am happy, if not It's okay too

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: This guy was amazing. He had his point of view and I had mine, but it was okay! He tried to understand everything and even though I sometimes didn't really got what he meant, I still felt that he didn't want to be offensive.

420,2019-09-09 00:16:13,d1j938,8,6,"This is a struggle I’ve had the past year. I’m AFAB, probably obviously.

On one hand...

1. I’ve never felt like one of the girls. I don’t have female friend groups. It’s not that I feel better than them (or worse), I don’t *relate* to women. Most of my good friends are guys or trans girls actually. I really have never had a typical group of girl friends.

2. I was definitely a tomboy as a kid. But that doesn’t even matter does it. When I turned 13 and realized I got more attention with makeup I started wearing it. Though I was an attention starved kid.

3. I’m bisexual with a strong preference towards loving women even though I happen to be with a man.

4.  I don’t really experience dysphoria I don’t think, if anything I’d rather not have boobs but have no strong dysphoria. BUT. If I ever got pregnant, I think I’d have MAJOR dysphoria. I have major tokophobia and fear of pregnancy and motherhood. It’s not just scary but honestly gross to me (NO judgment on pregnant folx!) 

5. I have diagnosed autism. Apparently 25% of autistic people are nb/trans (or maybe it’s trans people who’re autistic? I don’t remember)

6. I have experience with and love wearing a binder!

Yet...

1. I wear makeup and look traditionally feminine . You can pry my makeup brushes out of my cold dead hands.

2. I’m afraid I’m a closet misogynist because I really don’t want to conform to a lot of female culture. I don’t hate it I don’t think but maybe I do?

3. We say gender roles are dead or stupid but we ALL put ourselves into them. What’s up with that?

I don’t know but I feel super confused and I almost changed my Fb profile gender to Nb today but I constantly feel like some trendy phony even tho I don’t think nb is a trend.

I’m female assigned at birth and have believed to be up until recently. I don’t think I’m completely in the binary of male or female but it’s confusing. The thing is, I LOVE presenting femme. I love makeup, sparkles, long hair, most things stereotyped as ‘female’. It’s frustrating sometimes because I love ‘masculine’ clothes like big coats, suits, like kinda of men’s business wear. If I could wear it every day I would, it makes me feel most myself. But I also love makeup, so some people just label me as ‘butch’, especially when I have my hair short. 

There is a part of me inside that sometimes imagines myself as a man. Now I know this is totally normal even for cis people, but I increasingly have been fantasizing about it during being social, during sex, during and mostly just in my every day to day interactions with strangers. I have such a disconnect with my voice (it’s very gentle and sweet, like it’s a lovely voice), but sometimes when I hear it I’m like woah.. that’s me??!! I always imagine it to be a bit different and a lot deeper for some reason?

Body image is a whole different story, as I’ve suffered with eating disorders, so sometimes I don’t even recognize myself in the mirror. Like.. I know it’s me.. but there’s a disconnect, like I wasn’t expecting the mirror to reflect what I’m looking at you know? 

Now for the feeling non-binary part. I’ve always felt out of place.

hoo boy this sucked major ass. i just. why?

i was sitting next to this girl and her two friends were across the aisle. she started asking me these questions once i started putting my headphones in to play music like i always do. this first girl, i'll call her bente i guess. it starts like this:

bente: so are you a boy or a girl?  
me: ...no  
b: so you're a boy?  
m: no  
b: so you're a girl???  
m: NO \*tries to put headphones in\*  
b: are you autistic??  
m: no?!?!   
b: well it seems like you are because you're very rude and not talking to me  
m: i'm sorry i just don't want to talk....

then this next girl comes along, we'll call her chloe  
chloe: so uh do you have a vagina or a... penis..?  
me, already fucking freaking out and having dysphoria attack but i'm too much of a scaredy bitch to actually stop talking: uh-uh-uh a vagina why??  
chloe: well if you have a vajayjay that makes you a girl!11  
me: nononnonon  
bente: do you have boobs  
me: I FUCKING WISH I DIDNT  
bente and the other girl (not chloe) end up getting moved to the front for being loud in an unrelated incident  
chloe starts talking to the people behind me and her about me and it fucking sucks because she keeps saying ""she"" and shit  


this happened a few days ago and i literally wanted to jump out the window and i cried when i got home. i stg i wish i just didn't talk to them. i wish i just said ""fuck off"" or literally anything else. i just wish that this never happened i wish things could be different

I think they were shocked with how chill I was being about it. I'm now super excited that I get to badger HR about expressing that they're an inclusive workplace and yet only listing 2 genders. I love initiating change. I love challenging big (one of the biggest in Australia) retail to change how they operate. I'm going to have so much fun with this.

However, I and the rest of the programmers (who aren't part of the charity) are in agreement that it should be addressed to ""people with a cervix"" and that gender-neutral terms can be easily used. However, we're all cis, so we don't know what we're talking about, realistically; we just want to include everyone because the topic is important.

i've really been struggling with what i feel like i need to do to ease/get rid of my chest dysphoria. i'm really scared about the idea of top surgery because it seems super invasive and i'm worried the scars would be triggering for me. so i thought maybe just a breast reduction would be better, but i'm worried that it wouldn't be enough and i'd still have dysphoria after the reduction because im already only a b cup. i'm also scared that they would grow back a little because i'm 19 (turning 20 soon, and i wouldnt be able to get any surgeries until late next year at the earliest) and i take birth control..... which means extra estrogen! :,\^)

&amp;#x200B;

so i guess my biggest questions from people who have gotten either of the surgeries are:

1. i know this will vary from person to person, but how was the healing process? also as a note: i'm really squeamish, which is why i'm asking this question (to see if i could handle taking care of everything post op) 
2. (i hope this question is okay, its just a big worry i'm having) if you used to selfharm, were the scars from top surgery, specifically, triggering at all?
3. if you got a breast reduction and already had smallish breasts (a-c cup), did they grow back at all? and did you end up wanting top surgery afterwards? 
4. i don't want to wear a binder because i get almost daily breast pain which makes my dysphoria go Wild (easier to notice them when they hurt!!) and i'm worried that the tightness from the binder would make it worse. is there any alternative to ease chest dysphoria until i can figure out what surgery i want to get (and then actually get it)? i thought about sports bras, but i feel like i'd run into the tightness problem there too and they wouldnt flatten my chest enough

&amp;#x200B;

i hope that all made sense. i've been meaning to make this post for a long time now, but i had no idea how to word what i wanted to say and ask :\^(",NonBinary,top surgery vs breast reduction?,1568207302.0,"{'created_utc': 1568182102, 'id': 'd2ln9f', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 7, 'selftext': ""hi!\n\ni've really been struggling with what i feel like i need to do to ease/get rid of my chest dysphoria. i'm really scared about the idea of top surgery because it seems super invasive and i'm worried the scars would be triggering for me. so i thought maybe just a breast reduction would be better, but i'm worried that it wouldn't be enough and i'd still have dysphoria after the reduction because im already only a b cup. i'm also scared that they would grow back a little because i'm 19 (turning 20 soon, and i wouldnt be able to get any surgeries until late next year at the earliest) and i take birth control..... which means extra estrogen! :,\\^)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nso i guess my biggest questions from people who have gotten either of the surgeries are:\n\n1. i know this will vary from person to person, but how was the healing process? also as a note: i'm really squeamish, which is why i'm asking this question (to see if i could handle taking care of everything post op) \n2.

556,2019-09-11 18:17:19,d2ugxv,0,1,"Seven years ago for a brief 6 months I enjoyed a phase of clarity with myself and gender, only to be thrown, rather abruptly back into the sways of a deep depression, that, with the combination of medication, left me bedridden; a zombie in my own skin.

Recently the tides have turned on that front and I have, once again found myself in a place where I am well enough to see past the shroud of self loathing and at myself. As much as I expected the constant dysphoria I experienced with myself and my body to leave with the absence of depression, I instead found some wave of clarity that zoned in on aspects of my body that left me at a loss.

All hit rather abruptly in one moment; trying on lingerie for a partner.

It was a push-up bra that startled me, looking down and seeing real femininity on body and wanting to crawl out of my skin and leave it to die. I stayed wearing it for a minute before the unease was too much and I rid myself of it, shoving it back into the storage space it occupied, behind the baggy clothes that I wear to hide my body.

It really shouldn't have come as much of a surprise considering how many times the sentence had come out of my mouth ""I wish I had a guys body."" With full vigour, hoping after an alternate world where I was a man, knowing full well that in neither world, this or that, could I be happy.

Dreams of being an old person of ambiguous gender, dreams of being post op. The euphoria in the last one was immense when I woke up, only to fade as I realised the truth.

There are more examples but these are primary in my mind right now.

Thus far the need for the support tag is immensely lacking, that will be amended.

I've had a, what others call, 'rough start to life' and I've found that I don't feel I deserve the option of therapy. It may seem weird but, it feels like I've used up all my 'points' for therapy, as if one person is only allowed to have so many issues, I've used all mine and my dysphoria is invalid or not an option, no matter how real and ever present it is.

I guess, more than anything I want to rattle my mind into words and hope that someone will take those words and give me some form of direction to the mess I am right now.

And although cracking my egg happened only recently, I've been questioning and researching for almost five years.  I mean I've read and read and read so many studies and academic papers.  I've scoured reddit for anecdotal evidence. I've watched trans videos, looked up concepts of gender theory, etc. 

I've been seeing a therapist since mid-February and with her help and my own introspection... I am quite certain I am transgender and an enby.

Do I still question that fact?  Sure I do... constantly and particularly because I identify with being non-binary. 

So, as you might imagine it can be really hard when you are told you're conclusion of being transgender is wrong.... that my five years of research and half a year of therapy is wrong.  

I was talking with a friend recently and she (a transwoman who is not medically or socially transitioning yet except for electrolysis) asked me how I feel about my junk.  For context, we were having a pretty in depth conversation about transitioning, gender, society's perception of trans people, misogyny, passing, etc.  You know... a typical conversation. : )    During that conversation she said she didn't think I was trans because I admitted I experience very little, if any, dysphoria.  Instead, I experience euphoria and elation on being perceived as a woman. I told her I still identify as an enby but I don't feel comfortable expressing gender as androgynous.  So performing gender as a woman is better for me and I love it.

I had no idea my friend was a transmed.  How do you argue against transmedicalists who insist you aren't trans enough because you have little to no dysphoria?   I was hoping some of you would tell me your experience, if any, with dysphoria... or even better with euphoria.

Do any of you NOT experience dysphoria or very little?

tl/dr: Enby escapes into conventional presentation during periods of stress, feels immensely guilty about it, shit sucks. Thx.

The long:

AMAB, nonbinary 'officially' for a couple of years, genderbendy for years before that and probably struggling for decades. I'm also old (42 dammit). Started HRT last year and have been ramping up ultra-slowly and happy in a lot of ways with the changes.

But the other day I felt like garbage, was under the weather, got a stomach bug, and on the first day back to work I sorta slunk into flat out boymode because that's my retreat when I got no energy left to cope with the feeling of being exposed and out there, when I'm trying to really push my expression to align with what I feel, which is pretty femme.

It's hard though, because I feel like I'm just slinking back into male privilege, sucking it up, almost always mostly passing. I don't *like* that feeling. I've been holding it for the last few days and trying to understand it, maybe it's internalized binarism, guilt, shame? I dunno, I have to hash this with pshrink but it's not going to be pretty.

I can't go as femme as want all the time, I just can't, I honestly don't have the energy and frankly I'm fat, tall, wide-shouldered and pass as conventionally femme as a refrigerator with a skirt on it.

Gender based body bullshit has already kinda put the nix on me feeling happy being male and kinda the same again as to femme presentation because even if I went full transition (which as much as I want, I also don't want), I would make as awkward and un-celebrated presentation as a woman as I do as a man. Which is sorta the whole point of accepting myself as the non of binaries, but...why does it feel so fuckin' shitty sometimes! Frustrated femme or closeted masc, what do I wanna be?

I have been helping this friend for a few months. I figured out that she was trans before she came out to me (I have family who are trans, and I technically fall under the lable myself). She came out to me because I made it very clear that I would not only be safe, but supportive. She was very relieved. Myself and my partner were the first people she has ever been open with about any of this. She has come out to one other person so far, and I was super proud of her for that! It was very difficult, but she did it!

Now, comes the harder part... the rest of our friend group does not know yet. We know that they would be supportive with changing name/pronouns for her, however, for that to happen, she actually has to come out to them. 

Myself and my partner are the newest additions to the group of friends. I've only really started to get to know this friend in the past year. We're now fairly close, and I'm honored and touched that she felt safe and comfortable to be so open with me about what was a very scary topic for her. I even helped her with picking a new name, and she loves it... but I barely know these other people at all.

Ideally, what she wants me to do is 'accidentally' use her new name around them, in a way that's obviously referring to her. I am not okay with this, because I am so new to the friend group. Some of these people, she's known since early childhood. I'm worried that it will be seen as 'why couldn't you just tell is yourself' and 'why were you okay coming out to them and not us?'. It really seems to me like a nasty way of finding out, trying to see it from the other friends' perspective. 

I've already told her twice that I am not okay doing this, it feels like a bad way to come out to people who you've known for so many years. I've said that I would gladly be there for her if she is ready to come out to them, and I would even give her prompts in the conversation to help, but coming out should really come from her. I've suggested talking to individuals rather than the group, if that would be easier, and that I would help her however I could in doing so, whether it is holding her hand, being there, or stepping away to give her one on one time with them, but I am not going to out her out of the blue.

I'm an asexual binary trans woman and a group I'm a part of is changing the language in their bylaws to be more inclusive. For example, they are changing instances of words like committeeman to committeeperson, replacing the word ""sex"" with ""gender identity"", instances of ""men and women"" are being replaced with ""people"", etc.

One old rule this club has is that if the President of the group is a man, the Vice President has to be a woman. The original language was something to the effect of, ""The vice chair must be the opposite sex of the chair"". I'm sure they did this for diversity purposes when the group was formed but they still want to make sure that both positions aren't taken by men. They suggested changing the language to ""The vice chair must be of a different gender than the chair"" which was then updated again to say, ""The vice char must be of a different gender identity than the chair"". 

Here's the issue. People are looking to me to make sure this is properly inclusive language because I'm trans. But I also know that people who are agender don't identify as having a particular gender or gender identity. I asked a couple of my non binary friends about this but they don't identify as agender and weren't quite sure. 

So I came here in hopes of an answer. How would it be best to word this in our bylaws to be as inclusive as possible? I appreciate any guidance that you could give us!

I ask this question out of a desire to better understand and to be more informed so I hope it doesn’t come across as challenging in any way. In fact I write it with the hope that you can challenge and enlighten me. I will try to word it as best I can.

So I am trying to understand why a person who is physically male or female in sex (I guess excluding other scenarios for now to simplify the question) and who feels that they enjoy things or have aspects in their personality that are typically categorised as belonging to the other sex, would consider that being referred to in a non-binary way is the most applicable solution to the stereotypes?

My name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

**If you are interested, please visit** [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. 

If you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M. Paz Galupo (she/her or they/them), at [pgalupo@towson.edu](mailto:pgalupo@towson.edu) 

**Transgender Research Informed Consent (TRICON) Disclosure Policy:**

**Objective:** The objective is to gain a better understanding of how gender expectations, gender dysphoria, and body satisfaction may or may not interact to impact levels of sexual satisfaction. The results of this study will help to inform clinicians who work with transgender and non-binary clients to improve their sexual satisfaction.

**Primary Investigator:** The co-PI’s are Louis Lindley (graduate student at Towson University) and Annalisa Anzani (Doctoral Student at University of Milano – Bicocca) who are being supervised by Dr. M. Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)

**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. 

**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.

**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.

**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English. 

**Compensation:** There is no cost to participant in the study nor are there any travel requirements. There is no compensation for participating in the study. 

**Accessing Results:** The result of this study will be published in a peer reviewed journal. While we cannot guarantee that the article will be open access, we will post an accessible link to Louis Lindley’s research gate once it is accepted and published.",NonBinary,"Participants need for trans and non-binary affirming, sexual engagement study!",1568430979.0,"{'created_utc': 1568405779, 'id': 'd3uxvx', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 9, 'selftext': '  \n\n![img](8tps81ek4fm31)\n\nMy name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.\n\nWe are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities.

682,2019-09-13 20:50:35,d3veri,12,7,"So,
I’ve thought this for a while,
But basically, I’ve taken sociology classes and anthropology in university, and both say the same thing about gender and sex, gender being the human-made social construct of your identity while sex is your biological features. People in different cultures have diverse gender identities such as recognizing two genders, three, five, or even an innumerable amount. And people are born intersex - with genitals being a combination of the sexes. 
From that, we can see culturally that ‘gender’ is the social term we identify as, and sex manifests on a spectrum (it is not binary, just as anything in nature, things occur on a frequency of bell-curve where variations all along the natural biological range of sexes).
And it’s also commonly asserted now that toys, clothing, makeup, working industries, sports, hobbies, etc. DO NOT have a gender association; anyone can like anything and ‘gender’ cannot restrict or qualify what you’re allowed to like and do. 
With all of that background, I feel like even the definitions of femininity and masculinity are rendered moot and outdated, because you can’t categorize these gender identities as only one being ‘strong’ or ‘emotionally-intelligent’ or ‘intuitive’ or whatever other human attribute. Anyone can have these kind of attributes regardless of what they’re gender identity is. 
So for me, I don’t really believe gender is a term that has any meaning. We can talk biologically about people’s sex, because that is a tangible and natural occurrence, but gender is a construct. 
It’s not real.
So I have no understanding of what people really mean when they say they feel more feminine or more masculine, because to me I feel as though regardless of how you identify in that way, you’re just a person and those constraints on your identity have no true meaning.
I’m interested to hear other people’s thoughts on this!!

And people are born intersex - with genitals being a combination of the sexes. \nFrom that, we can see culturally that ‘gender’ is the social term we identify as, and sex manifests on a spectrum (it is not binary, just as anything in nature, things occur on a frequency of bell-curve where variations all along the natural biological range of sexes).\nAnd it’s also commonly asserted now that toys, clothing, makeup, working industries, sports, hobbies, etc. DO NOT have a gender association; anyone can like anything and ‘gender’ cannot restrict or qualify what you’re allowed to like and do. \nWith all of that background, I feel like even the definitions of femininity and masculinity are rendered moot and outdated, because you can’t categorize these gender identities as only one being ‘strong’ or ‘emotionally-intelligent’ or ‘intuitive’ or whatever other human attribute. Anyone can have these kind of attributes regardless of what they’re gender identity is. \nSo for me, I don’t really believe gender is a term that has any meaning. We can talk biologically about people’s sex, because that is a tangible and natural occurrence, but gender is a construct. \nIt’s not real.\nSo I have no understanding of what people really mean when they say they feel more feminine or more masculine, because to me I feel as though regardless of how you identify in that way, you’re just a person and those constraints on your identity have no true meaning.\nI’m interested to hear other people’s thoughts on this!!

Back when I first began questioning my gender identity, I questioned my own name, too. I wondered whether it was too ‘girly’ and why I was even opposed to the thought of being girly in the first place.

For awhile, I wanted something new to describe who I was. I ended up creating a name for myself, which I used in the occasional place online, that consisted of both a more traditionally masculine name, and a more traditionally feminine name.

Once I came to terms with being nonbinary (demigirl specifically), I abandoned the created name. I never had anyone I knew in real life call me by it anyways, so it was easy to leave behind. After all, figuring out that I wasn’t a cis girl explained a lot of things for me, and why I never liked the idea of being a ‘girly’ girl and hated pink (even tho its a perfectly valid color!!), even when I wasn’t the most tomboyish as a kid. (I was in a pretty good place in the middle, to be fair.) 

My attachment to my birth name has also grown in recent years, from moving away to my slightly childish nickname (mostly an anxiety thing, I’ve always embraced my childish side) to almost completely leaving the nickname behind due to finding out the reason behind it not being something you might actually get from my name and for it not being spelled traditionally, either. (Was created by my father, he is a narcissist and of course it had to be all about him.)

Along with changing the spelling of my nickname to the traditional form and restricting its use to family members/very close childhood friends who have called me it my entire life, I’ve also reverted to the traditional pronunciation of my birth name among certain people. My father’s family refused to pronounce it the way the Italian (mother’s family is Italian) name is supposed to be pronounced because ‘it doesn’t look like that’, so my mom gave in and let it be changed (she gave in a lot when it came to my name - my dad didn’t like her other ideas and she was just trying to keep peace in letting him make my nickname the way it is). 

I’ve also toyed with the idea of a new nickname of my own choosing/one my friend helped me come up with that I’ve thought about using at school and with friends. 

Anyways, point is I’ve dealt with a lot of name changing recently and while I haven’t completely permanently changed anything yet, and this was just another instance of new names around certain people.

My friend’s boyfriend knows the story behind the pronunciation of my first name, and it kinda confuses him, so he’s taken to calling me Abe. Today, I was randomly thinking about the old name I’d created for myself, and I texted him to tell him that if he insists on calling me by a guy’s name as a joke, call me by the one I used to use online, I won’t get as jokingly annoyed 😂 He said he’d think about it. (Have his number cuz he’s DMing a DnD group I’m in with one of my close friends, his girlfriend.)

I’d never shared that name with anyone else before, but I’ve been trying out new names and nicknames and combinations a lot recently, so I decided to hell with it, I’m gonna have someone start calling me that and we’ll see how I feel about it. And it turns out I’m feeling pretty happy with it so far.

Tl;dr: 

Lots of name stuff/new knowledge behind it has had me toying with new nicknames/versions of my name recently, and I gave one friend who jokingly calls me “Abe” (bc of confusion surrounding my actual name) an old created name I used for myself online back when I was first realizing that I’m nonbinary to use as a joking male name for me (gave him the first half of it, the traditionally male bit, but the name is a male name and female name together like a first and middle name.)",NonBinary,"When I first started questioning my gender identity, I created a name both masculine and feminine for myself, which I used online.

I’m fine with this! So I recently came out to everyone as a non-binary trans man. This seems very fitting. However, I’m wondering if there is a label that sort of encompasses me better.

What non-binary phrases are there that I could explore? My gender seems to go to third gender, man,  and “f*ck gender” the most. My gender expression however is an amalgamation of very feminine, very masculine, and androgynous.

TW - Eating disorder triggers, no numbers


Things are mostly good, but I've continued to gain weight and that scares me. I've gotten really good at avoiding my reflection and wearing loose clothes; and I haven't weighed myself so I'm still ”blissfully unaware” of how bad things are. But, in the last few days I've noticed that even my ”fat” clothes are getting snug and I'm very close to needing to replace my entire wardrobe. 


I went to Target today and tried on some clearance shorts and pants from the men's department. The fitting room was awkward as I carefully avoided mirrors. I ended up buying a pair of shorts that sorta fit but I don't even know if they look stupid because I couldn't force myself to look at my reflection. 


In the past, the need to buy bigger clothes has ALWAYS triggered a relapse in my ED. I'd like to think that this time will be different because I'm getting gender-affirming stuff.

I've gotten really good at avoiding my reflection and wearing loose clothes; and I haven't weighed myself so I'm still ”blissfully unaware” of how bad things are. But, in the last few days I've noticed that even my ”fat” clothes are getting snug and I'm very close to needing to replace my entire wardrobe. \n\n\nI went to Target today and tried on some clearance shorts and pants from the men's department.

\[I'd love to hear about your story, thank you very much in advance if you decide to share\]

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my experience if you're interested:

I've been questioning my gender for over a year now and I've still not quite figured it out.

I've been thinking I might be ***non binary*** and ***genderfluid***, but I'm still not sure.

* I'm ***AFAB*** and I don't feel legitimate as I feel like my gender *fluctuates*, I happen to feel ""*woman-ly***""** and *nb*, or something else than ""*woman*"" as in a ""*gray area*"". (I had a point where I thought I was *bigender*, more specifically *bigirl*, but saying *bigirl* gives the girl part too much attention, which doesn't feel as right as it used to)
* I would not feel comfortable with ""he/him"" pronouns. But I do with ***she/her*** and ***they/them*** pronouns. Although, I really dislike to be referred to ""madam"" or such things.
* I deeply reject social gender norms as well, but I don't know if it's because I'm deconstructing myself from social constructs or because it's on a personal level.
* The same goes for the clothes I wear, I like clothes from the men's and women's section. I sometimes like to wear one more than the other, it fluctuates.
* I also like to have body hair and not shave them which makes me feel good and less ""woman-ly"" (as in the social stereotype and norm for women), and more me? like ""damn I don't look \*stereotypically or typically to disgusting social norms\* like a woman""
* I used to ""defend"" nb people, and it'd hurt when they would get misgendered or invalidated by others. However, now it hurts me on an another level. Personal level.

When I talk about it I'm feeling very good and authentic. Then when I don't talk about it, I feel like it's all a lie? and I feel weird? **Especially** after talking about it with close-friends as they don't know much about it all... 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm genderqueer, I'm queer. I'll say that so I don't have to put any gender or anything on it whilst figuring it all out. Talking about it now, I'd say I'm NB. Ugh.

Someone accidentally referring to me as ""them"", reading a book with a non-binary character, following nb people on internet, talking about it to a couple of people around me, and Sam Smith coming out as non binary pushed me to talk about trying they/them pronouns to my close friends. And questioning my gender even more.

&amp;#x200B;

However, given that I am non-binary I am not necessarily looking for the conventional FTM transition. I’ve had gender dysphoria for years now (basically ever since puberty) and in the past thought that I would probably end up identifying as male. The issue with that though is that i’ve always felt connected to femininity, and love dressing and presenting in a feminine way when I feel like it. My dysphoria sorta phases in and out. I’ll go for pretty long periods of time where I feel fine with people assuming i’m a girl, and I’ll actually feel mostly ok with my body, and feel like maybe i’d be fine if i didn’t transition (i’ll still want to). Then the dysphoria comes back very badly and I’ll have to bind and present in a more masculine way. I have a connection to womanhood and love dressing in a feminine way and using makeup, but still have gender dysphoria and desire to be read as male. But I also do not want to swing too far into the male-esque side of the pendulum. So, with that said here are some of my questions and concerns. 

• Are there options when it comes to hormonal transition that won’t completely masculinize me? 
• I am concerned that if I see a gender therapist, or if I go through the screening process in order to get treatment for transitioning, the fact that I don’t always like to present as male will cause me to not be taken seriously. Does anyone have experience with this?
• In the case that I can’t receive hormone treatment because of my unconventionality, is there a way to significantly masculinize my hormonal balance without a prescription?

So I’ve identified as a lesbian for 6/7 years now (isn’t it scary, the passage of time?) and I am really comfortable with that. It feels right. It’s an important part of my identity. About 4 years ago I started to feel a little unsure about my gender (for context I’m afab. Am I still f? Who knows?). I’m definitely not a man but I’m not quite (?) a woman but I’m also not completely unrelated to being a woman but also I might be but also what the fuck is going on. I started to look into being non binary and even going by they/them and gender neutral names (the names didn’tfit me at all but like I was more focused on the gender neutral-ness at the time) online however eventually I stopped. I’d thought about several nb identies like demigirl or agender or genderfluid and I wasn’t sure any felt right and it all kind of stressed me out and also, and possible most importantly, I didnt want to not be a lesbian, because that was (and still is) so right for me. So I kind of pushed it aside and stopped myself from thinking about it because I figured if I wanted to keep the lesbian identity I felt so comfortable in I HAD to be a girl. 

More recently I discovered that non binary lesbians are actually a thing and like that was an interesting discovery that has kind of upheaved my entire perception on my gender so that’s fun. So now I’m thinking about my gender again and like? I don’t know. Except maybe I do???

When I think about gender, the first thought I have is always something like “well why are you asking me I don’t know” (that’s me to myself my thought process is weird) or some kind of gender joke like “my gender is goth” or “my gender is *loud truck drives past” or something like that. I feel like there’s a lot of confusion but apathy towards that confusion. Like my attitude to gender is “who knows who cares girls are pretty”. Like it almost feels like lesbian could be my gender too if that makes any sense. Like the only way I am connected to gender at all is that I’m a lesbian. 

Also I don’t know where to put this in the structure of this post but it was my birthday yesterday and I got a card from my grandma addressed to “Miss [my name]” and I think I physically grimaced. It was also pink and florally inside but that’s less a gender thing and more a “my grandmother has no idea who I am as a person”. That’s important because it’s the first time I’ve noticed myself being uncomfortable referred to that way. Like I’ve noticed a dislike of some gendered words but that’s the first time I’ve noticed I’ve disliked it being used towards me and linked it to whatever the fuck is going on with my gender (probably because we’d just been talking about Sam Smith. Won’t dwell on that conversation but let’s just say if I am nb I won’t be coming out to my brother. :/ Though I wasn’t gonna be doing that about the lesbian part anyway) so now I’m like oh.

There’s more things that just add to things as well.  It’s become a thing to put pronouns in social media descriptions, especially if you’re cis so it’s normalised, and all my friends (okay my one friend and all her friends who I’ve kinda just adopted) do it but I don’t because I’m not sure. It doesn’t feel right to put she/her in my description. I’m not sure it feels like me.  Im not sure enough to put they/them in my description. I also don’t relate to many people’s experiences of being a woman? Like I wish I could explain that better but women will be talking about their experiences being a woman and I’ll be like hmm don’t relate at all. I also tend to gravitate towards characters in things that don’t seem to give a shit about gender and stuff like that

I don’t know if you’ve noticed reading this but i feel like my uncertainty may be less about whether or not I’m non binary or whether or not I want to admit I’m non binary. Like I feel like I could easily in a few years look back at this and be like “how did you think you were a cis woman you dumbass” but also at the same time I don’t feel sure. Maybe it’s because I’m not nb maybe it’s because to me it feels like a big step to say I am.

I\'ve seen proposals like ""ze"" or things like that, but I have no idea if that\'s common or not or if there even is a common one.\n\nFurthermore, what do non-binary people think about a usually plural pronoun being used to refer to them as singular persons?\n\nAlso, obviously ""they"" is so common now that it probably will not be changed, but if you could make up a non-binary singular pronoun that everyone would use, what would you pick?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Is there a common, explicitly singular, non-binary pronoun?', 'created': 1568843203.0}"

961,2019-09-18 19:54:31,d63798,16,9,"Hi there!

So, I'm in a bit of a difficult situation at the moment. I spend a lot of time in trans spaces  and I'm very femme presenting. One of the reasons I started spending time almost exclusively in trans spaces is in queer spaces I get assumed to be a cis woman and I get hit on by lesbians. I generally tell those lesbians I'm NB and they tell me I'm within their sexuality because for them lesbian means attraction to non-men. 

This made me incredibly dysphoric because to me I'm essentially being told I'm 'close enough' to a woman that they can ignore my identity. Like, no, you're a lesbian, I'm not a woman. At all. we aren't compatible. You don't get to force me into a binary (men and non-men) when I just told you I'm done with that.

Now I'm in trans spaces more or less exclusively cause I thought I could get away from that, but now it's happening with NB lesbians. I really want to trust that they view me as my gender, but I still can't help but feel like I'm being told I'm 'close enough' which feels totally dehumanizing. It feels like I'm having my gender taken away by other non-binary people. I guess my main issue is I can't understand why someone would identify with the woman-loving sexuality if they don't see the people they date as women? It makes me think I'm being given 2 pieces of contradictory information.

So, I'm genuinely sorry if I offended at all, I certainly don't mean to would be happy to receive feedback on anything I said badly. I really want to be more comfortable around NB lesbians, and would so appreciate thoughts on how I could think about non-binary lesbians differently. I'd also really appreciate if any NB lesbians who are willing to share could explain why they ID with their sexuality and how it interacts with their gender.

984,2019-09-19 07:17:29,d6aiu9,5,15,"Hello Everyone,

(I will try to make this as short and quick as possible)

This is my first time posting here. Im a mid 20s ""female"" living in Dubai. Both my parents are conservative Muslims (however they are not extremists so its not THAT bad). I first realized i was bisexual by the age of 15-16 and confirmed that i was a lesbian at age 18. Now that I am in my mid 20s in a serious relationship with perhaps the most wonderful person i have come across, i am starting to focus on things i used to sweep under the rug.

My partner, a late 20s pan female, has introduced me into the path of self love and self acceptance and has always given me unconditional love and support. Because of that, I am no longer sweeping things under the rug and instead learning to deal with them. My father beat me up really bad and locked me in my room for one week without food just water when he found out I was a lesbian. (i was 17y/o &amp; a year away from graduating high school and my ex-gf's mom outed us). I had no choice but to come out to my mother(my parents have been divorced since i was 14) she held me as i cried and told me ""this is a mistake this is disgusting, god will punish you, just dont repeat it again and everything will be fine""

Fast forward to 8 years later. Im working, im independent and have a very limited and minimal relationship with both my mother and father. I have not cut them out completely but i have put boundaries that they often break and i have to pull back. I sleep mostly in hotels or with my gf since we are moving out in November or when i am really trying to save more money i stay at my mother's house but dont communicate unless she speaks to me. My parents are still assholes if not bigger assholes than before, my father i dont talk to anymore and after so many years finally had the courage to block him on social media. my mother started hitting me again every now and then when she gets in her mood. The point is right now, i am happy with who i am, im slowly learning to be more and more confident and i am learning to put my foot down. I can say this is the best i have ever been since i was 14 and thats a little over a decade ago. 

My issue is, it took me my whole life a lot of fighting a lot of blood sweat and tears (literally, 2 suicide attempts, alcohol dependency, drug addiction, self-harm, sexual assault) to be where i am and say i am an atheist and a lesbian to my family and not giving two fucks about their reaction or opinions of me, basically being true to myself. But deep down i dont feel like a ""woman"". Sometimes i fantasize about being a man and i think mostly because women dont get much in my society, culture, religion and country. So i dont know if when i feel like i am truly a man if its a way of escaping the shit in my life or if thats truly how i feel. Then, i dont feel like a man or a woman, i just feel like me. Pronouns never affected me but male pronouns did sexually excite me and sometimes make me feel warm inside and my partner sometimes calls me her boyfriend and it makes me happy. But i dont know if thats who i really am. I dont feel like a man or a woman and this is harder because i feel all this fighting and hurt ive been through with society and my family was for nothing if thats the case. I know it wasnt, but i cant help the irrational feeling inside of me. How do i know what i am? how can i settle this? its driving me insane and slowly down the rabbit hole that took me so long to come out of.

I've identified as male all my life. I have a bi cis-female wife in a happy marriage with a child. I have a beard and I like how I look with it. I have never experienced dysphoria about my body.

But dammit, I want to be PRETTY. I wanted Lee Press-On Nails as a kid. Still kinda do. I loved wearing makeup for drama in high school, and I felt more real being someone else rather than being myself. Eye makeup would just make me feel beautiful. Sometimes I feel like I identify more with female characters in fiction than male. I enjoy playing female characters in RPGs, and even did it a couple of times in tabletop and online games. One friend said ""when I'm playing with you, I forget you're a guy.""

Also, I love the word ""enby."" It's cute. It's a much less daunting word than ""non-binary,"" and less scary to me than ""genderqueer."" Maybe the word makes things less scary. 

What's my deal? 

* Do I just dislike some traditionally male norms and like some traditionally female norms? 
* Do I just want to feel special because being a cis-het white male makes me feel bland and boring? Am I appropriating terms from this community to that end?
* Is it wrong that I have nothing wrong with using ""he/him"" pronouns, but become daunted that the moderators flair is almost universally they/them? 
* Do I resist this concept because I'm in a public-facing profession where changing any gender expression would be disastrous? 
* Would accepting this identity make me less of an effective advocate than being a cis-het white guy does? Is it wrong that I experience guilt over this concept?

I don't know, and I have no idea where to start asking questions other than here. I'm even a little scared to ask my wife (who, bless her soul, would have no problem with it).

998,2019-09-19 15:03:18,d6fali,3,27,"Tl;dr: My experience being raised as gender-free as possible and how that turned out. 

After having seen that a story I shared about my trans-accepting grandma had brightened some people's days, I have decided to share with you folk how my parents raised me as gender-free as possible. I know I have the privilege of having a very forward-thinking and accepting family, and that not everybody does, but I do hope sharing this story can give people insight into what families can be like, both now and in the future. 

When I came out as nb to my father about a month ago, he said he had always known, in a way. In fact, though he is not extremely well-versed on LGBTQ+ lingo, he said something that really stuck with me: that him and my mom tried to raise me as free from gender restrictions as possible. They acknowledged and taught me that society has ""boys"" and ""girls"", but also that people don't have to exclusively be either. They never negated biological differences, but rather taught me that they were merely that: chromosomes being expressed, nothing more. 

I was born in 1999 in Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, so neither the worst nor the best place and time for trans issues. I was assigned female at birth and, like many of you growing up, never felt comfortable conforming to either gender on the binary. The thing that made a huge difference, though, is that my parents never held that against me. They respected that I chose my own clothes, toys, and they actively tried to not ""gender"" said activities (e.g. saying that playing with dolls was only for girls, etc.). Even when I referred to myself with different pronouns (sometimes female, sometimes male), they still respected and validated my choices from as early on as I can remember. It was never a ""big deal"", I just existed and that was that. They never said things such as ""that's just a phase"" or ""you are just confused"", etc. Now I know that that was an active choice of theirs to allow me to be myself, and that they always have and will love me for myself. They more often than not used the nickname ""cub"" (""filhote"" in Portuguese) for me (I have commented on that before, I think) instead of ""filha"" or ""filho"" (daughter and son, respectively), and now dad has explained to me why.  As a result, I didn't struggle with gender disforia as much as I probably would have if I hadn't had such a chill and loving environment, and I feel accepted and loved by my family.

I am so privileged and thankful for having a family that  tried their best (we all make mistakes along the way, but still) to let me just be myself, loving me no matter what. Now I wish to pass that on to my children someday, and hopefully inspire a few of you to do the same. Remember, love is one of the few things that you can give as much as you want, and you will still never have less of it. 

An anecdote: when I was 2, I got a baby doll from a family friend for my birthday. The doll had xy parts, but I decided that my doll was a girl. My parents used that situation to teach me that, indeed, some people are born with bodies that differ from how they identify, and they are just like everyone else. Looking back, it was a great teachable moment, especially considering that Bebeca (how I named her) was my favourite doll in the world.

1022,2019-09-19 21:06:58,d6kc5w,3,7,"Hi

So I'm currently a student in college, and it's been going pretty well! Catch is, this is the first time I've really been in any kind of social place since I realised that I'm not cis. I've been considering coming out, but haven't really been too motivated to do it. I'm nonbinary genderfluid, and typically don't mind being referred to with my birth gender- I do use the pronouns associated with it sometimes, so that doesn't cause me dysphoria.

However, in sociology we have begun to study gender roles. The topic is pretty interesting, but the catch is that, obviously, our personal gender comes up frequently. At first I was fine with it, but the more it happened the worse I felt, and I couldn't focus at all in the last 15 minutes of the class. It was the last class of the day so I was able to calm down, but it's left me with a problem.

I'm considering coming out to my sociology teacher, so that he knows not to gender me in class, but I'm very nervous about it. Where I live isn't conservative, but most people are pretty oblivious to anything LGBT+. I don't know if he even knows what nonbinary or genderfluid mean, and I don't know if I would be comfortable explaining it.

I've decided to wait until my next sociology class on Monday to decide what to do so I can think things through properly, but I guess I'd just like some advice, if anyone has any? I don't think that coming out would put me in danger, but I also don't know if I'm really ready to deal with what could come with coming out. I don't know any other trans people at the college either, so there's no one like that who I can go to for advice.

So, for context, I'm AFAB and I've always been a bit of a tomboy, but I come from a traditional family so I ended up presenting very femme when I started puberty. Society got into my brain too, it told me that I had to be feminine, show my curves, wear a cleavage, long hair, makeup, etc. Y'all know the deal. And so I did. Until this summer (I'm 24), after a very bad relationship and breakup, I realized that my appearance has never been my own. With the years, I've tried to go back to the tomboyish look, but only enough so that I wouldn't be judged. 

Here's where the gender thing comes in. My country is pretty traditional, I only learned what non-binary meant a couple years ago. And I've always questioned my relationship with gender, but never consciously till now. Until this summer, I just felt bad because even though I didn't want to be a boy, I felt as though the ""girl"" label wasn't right. And people told me that I'm just more masculine, tomboy, or a lesbian (?), etc. 

Regarding my body, I always wore my brother's clothes, and boy's swimsuits when I was a child (I live in a pretty hot country), and it took a lot of convincing for me to wear a bikini, and even then, I refused to wear the top part of it. When I went into puberty and had to wear the top, it was very dramatic for me. Bras were also very dramatic, so I started wearing sport bras that made me flatter. And still nowadays, I tend to go for a flatter look. I also tend to like pants that make me less ""curvy"". 

And the most dramatic part of it all, and where all of this comes from: my hair. I've worn it very long for years, but I always wear it up because I don't like it. I've been wanting to cut it for years, but I'm always told that ""it's too pretty"" or that I'll lose my sex appeal or whatever. And this summer, I kind of decided to do it (still haven't done it yet, I'm too afraid in case I actually lose the one thing that's pretty about me). 

Basically all this time I've been dressing femme for other people, wearing long hair for other people, acting more ladylike for other people. And for years I've thought that this ""girl"" label doesn't fit, but I don't feel non-binary enough, as if I don't fit the criteria. As if I'm just a masculine girl who doesn't like traditional gender roles, and that's it. Because even though I don't like the girl label, I don't really have dysphoria (apart from wanting to be flatter and less curvy, but I solve that with clothes and not looking at myself in the mirror that much), I don't care about she/her pronouns, I'm okay with my private parts... I basically feel like I'm underestimating people who are actually trans or actually enby.

1050,2019-09-20 05:07:39,d6q3gw,0,9,"Gender. The final frontier. These are the voyages of SaintRidley. Their mission: fuck if anyone knows. Does it really matter? What the hell am I doing here?

Yeah. That’s sort of the gist of how my brain is dealing with the question. I’m AMAB and I sure look it. I’m hairy, I have been heavily socialized as male. So naturally, it seemed simple. I was a boy. I think the doubt that it was so simple began creeping into the back of my head as a result of two minor things, about 7 years ago. I had already been wearing women’s clothes and getting my wife to help me with makeup annually around Halloween during college, but she asked a question around the start of grad school when I bought my first pair of thigh high boots: “Are you sure you’re not trans?” I answered quickly and, for the time, honestly with a simple no.

Around this same time the other minor thing happened. I was chatting with a friend on facebook, and she was trying to understand the attachment some people have toward certain pronouns. She explained that she didn’t have a very strong identification with feminine pronouns, and that she didn’t really have a very strong attachment to or clear idea of what it even meant to “be a woman.” In chatting with her, I realized that I never really gave it a lot of thought myself and I wasn’t very different. I always just kind of defaulted into working with masculine pronouns. I never really felt comfortable with what seemed to be the generally agreed upon idea of what it meant to “be a man.” I was just like, “Yeah, I’m a guy, I guess.”

All disclaimers about egg discourse being problematic in effect, but I can definitely think back to some definite cracks in the shell from about as long ago as I can remember. Lots of them, too many to go into detail here. A small one, but perhaps a bit more telling than I ever imagined it, is how I come up wth D&amp;D characters. I have never once felt any significant attachment to any male-identifying character I have created. And while my favorite characters I’ve created and been able to play have been women, the ones I pour the most effort into creating are those with no or unstable gender. Give me the opportunity to play a Warforged (magic robot) or a Changeling and I won’t play anything else, because then I don’t have to deal with being stuck on the binary. I’ll make a Warforged pro wrestler character whose catchphrase is “To be the nongendered entity, you gotta beat the nongendered entity! And I am the nongendered entity.” Give me a Changeling and I’ll have about half a dozen different personas of various genders for them to work with because I won’t be stable along a binary. That’s what always appealed to me about these character options. Being able to escape the limits of human biology for a moment and to have characters whose physical capabilities supported a nontraditional gender expression. Okay, yeah, that’s a pretty big crack in the egg.

It hit me around the fifth time I encountered the “trans button question” that maybe there was something going on deeper in my brain. Y'all know how the trans button question asks “If you were offered a button that could turn you into a [wo]man (based on where you are currently identifying on the binary), irreversibly, and completely (both physically and socially), would you press it?” I first encountered this question in this form in the chat of one of my friends, a twitch streamer named shovda (she plays Mario and is really fucking good at it and you should watch her streams).

So where am I? Give me lipstick. Give me eyeliner and eyeshadow (someone teach me how to get over being afraid of putting it near my eyes). Give me all of it, please.

Genderfuck.",NonBinary,So I've been journaling a bit about figuring gender shit out for myself,1568981259.0,"{'created_utc': 1568956059, 'id': 'd6q3gw', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 9, 'selftext': ""Gender. The final frontier. These are the voyages of SaintRidley. Their mission: fuck if anyone knows. Does it really matter? What the hell am I doing here?\n\nYeah. That’s sort of the gist of how my brain is dealing with the question. I’m AMAB and I sure look it. I’m hairy, I have been heavily socialized as male. So naturally, it seemed simple. I was a boy. I think the doubt that it was so simple began creeping into the back of my head as a result of two minor things, about 7 years ago. I had already been wearing women’s clothes and getting my wife to help me with makeup annually around Halloween during college, but she asked a question around the start of grad school when I bought my first pair of thigh high boots: “Are you sure you’re not trans?” I answered quickly and, for the time, honestly with a simple no.\n\nAround this same time the other minor thing happened. I was chatting with a friend on facebook, and she was trying to understand the attachment some people have toward certain pronouns. She explained that she didn’t have a very strong identification with feminine pronouns, and that she didn’t really have a very strong attachment to or clear idea of what it even meant to “be a woman.” In chatting with her, I realized that I never really gave it a lot of thought myself and I wasn’t very different. I always just kind of defaulted into working with masculine pronouns. I never really felt comfortable with what seemed to be the generally agreed upon idea of what it meant to “be a man.” I was just like, “Yeah, I’m a guy, I guess.”\n\nAll disclaimers about egg discourse being problematic in effect, but I can definitely think back to some definite cracks in the shell from about as long ago as I can remember. Lots of them, too many to go into detail here. A small one, but perhaps a bit more telling than I ever imagined it, is how I come up wth D&amp;D characters. I have never once felt any significant attachment to any male-identifying character I have created. And while my favorite characters I’ve created and been able to play have been women, the ones I pour the most effort into creating are those with no or unstable gender. Give me the opportunity to play a Warforged (magic robot) or a Changeling and I won’t play anything else, because then I don’t have to deal with being stuck on the binary. I’ll make a Warforged pro wrestler character whose catchphrase is “To be the nongendered entity, you gotta beat the nongendered entity! And I am the nongendered entity.” Give me a Changeling and I’ll have about half a dozen different personas of various genders for them to work with because I won’t be stable along a binary. That’s what always appealed to me about these character options. Being able to escape the limits of human biology for a moment and to have characters whose physical capabilities supported a nontraditional gender expression. Okay, yeah, that’s a pretty big crack in the egg.\n\nIt hit me around the fifth time I encountered the “trans button question” that maybe there was something going on deeper in my brain. Y'all know how the trans button question asks “If you were offered a button that could turn you into a [wo]man (based on where you are currently identifying on the binary), irreversibly, and completely (both physically and socially), would you press it?” I first encountered this question in this form in the chat of one of my friends, a twitch streamer named shovda (she plays Mario and is really fucking good at it and you should watch her streams). And the first time I encountered it, I answered it. I said that I wouldn’t, because I’d prefer a toggle that would let me go back and forth at will.

(sorry for the slight rant and bad grammar;
i mention (pretty light) feelings about my chest if that bothers anyone &lt;3)

When I look into the mirror, I see a reflection, not myself. I've been questioning for around two years (but had always felt pretty neutral about gender as a kid) and only within the past few months have I done any research. After coming across the term nonbinary, I felt as though it fit and I could immediately identify with it. But after researching it more, I've had a hard time figuring out if I actually count as non-binary.

Sure, my boobs haven't ever really looked or felt right, but they don't really make me upset, I just change my clothes and move on. I think I'd feel better flat chested, aside from any unwanted attention it may attract (in my small 'everyone knows everyone' school). I cant imagine doing anything remotely intimate involving my boobs either (but I've never done anything anyways so what do I know). I don't really fit in with my (all girls) cheer team socially, even though I like the sport, and find that I can't relate to them and their feelings and wish to spend my time doing anything other than planning to get my nails done after the season is over. I tend to pause whenever I need to fill out my pronouns/gender on surveys and documents. I don't feel upset if someone uses she/her with me, but every time someone uses he/him or they/them for me ('mistakenly' over voice chat playing fill games or irl, short hair and deeper voice) I feel happy. Its kind of awkward when my friends 'correct' them too because I couldn't care less about being completely viewed as a girl. I feel like I don't experience real dysphoria though, because I've read about so much worse.

I came out as questioning to my mom in May because I was having a tough time and was really upset and anxious a lot of the time. She told me that I didn't need to think about it, because ""what's wrong with just being a girl? They can wear boys clothes too."" But it just wasn't that simple for me. Now, after 'thinking' of myself with the label of nonbinary, I feel much more at ease. I just don't want how I'm feeling to change later on (maybe I end up just liking androgyny?) and get an ""I told you so"". 


tl;dr I feel invalid, anxious, and unsure and everyone on the internet seems to have much worse dysphoria than I 'experience'. Could I be non-binary?

1100,2019-09-21 04:15:51,d75wb3,6,11,"ok ok so also if anyone’s curious why I’m going back on T if I was dysphoric and lowkey miserable on T before, here’s the scoop --- tw for mentions of dysphoria (obviously), health issues, and eating disorders

Firstly, a lot of the issues I had while on T also had to do with how bad my mental and physical health were at the time - I was gaining a lot of weight and my anxiety and CFS were getting worse and those things are DEFINITELY related and T just kind of created the perfect storm to make me unhappy 

And, yes, some of the changes gave me whole new dysphoria! While I experienced dysphoria over my genitals and sometimes my chest and definitely my voice and height pre-T, on T the facial hair growth and the changes in my face and body shape were very upsetting to me (although, looking back, how much of that was due to weight gain and the worsening of my eating disorder is up for debate) 

Here’s the thing, though, is that I think also a lot of my struggle was with how incredibly fast changes were happening. It was like one day I recognized myself and the next day I didn’t. I was anxious, scared, intimidated, and felt ashamed that I had somehow made the wrong choice. It didn’t help that I realized part of why I’d started T was because I felt pressured by the queer community to medically transition even though I myself wasn’t totally sure about what I wanted yet. 

So, now my mental and physical health are in the best shape they’ve really even been in, even if neither are perfect y’know, and I’ve started to get my weight back under control. And with a lot of stress off my shoulders finally, dysphoria has really started to creep back in in a way it hasn’t in a long time, because I finally have the brainspace to process it. And I put a lot of thought into it, consulted with multiple drs and my therapist and my partners and friends and family, and I decided I wanted to try T again, at a much lower dose this time.

The way I see it, slower and milder changes is much more up my alley, and I know how to cope with and mitigate the less than pleasant side effects much better now than I did a year and a half ago. And honestly? I don’t totally plan to stay on low dose T forever either! I might change my mind and stay on, but mostly I want to complete and/or enhance some aspects of my transition that were put on hold before - like my voice needs to finish dropping, I’d like more bottom growth because oh BOY the euphoria I got from that was strong, and I’d be fine with more body hair and I’d like to work at building up muscles maybe this time, and most of that will stick around or only somewhat soften if I go off T again someday. 

Being nonbinary, really having any kind of complicated relationship with gender even if you are binary and tbh what trans person has a simple relationship with gender, can mean finding a nontraditional route of transition that can involve stopping, starting, and detransitioning and that’s super valid and doable! The important thing is that we all make the choices that ultimately make us happiest in our own skin.

And honestly? I don’t totally plan to stay on low dose T forever either! I might change my mind and stay on, but mostly I want to complete and/or enhance some aspects of my transition that were put on hold before - like my voice needs to finish dropping, I’d like more bottom growth because oh BOY the euphoria I got from that was strong, and I’d be fine with more body hair and I’d like to work at building up muscles maybe this time, and most of that will stick around or only somewhat soften if I go off T again someday.\xa0\n\nBeing nonbinary, really having any kind of complicated relationship with gender even if you are binary and tbh what trans person has a simple relationship with gender, can mean finding a nontraditional route of transition that can involve stopping, starting, and detransitioning and that’s super valid and doable! The important thing is that we all make the choices that ultimately make us happiest in our own skin.\xa0\n\nI'm super open to answer any questions about starting and stopping T or anything else :)"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Why I stopped HRT and am Starting Again (cross posted on r/genderqueer)', 'created': 1569064551.0}"

I’m obsessed with red lipstick and before I use to think red lipstick was this forbidden taboo shade that only adults wore. 

I remember being given a small tube of red lipstick for Christmas in middle school and one day when I wore it to school I got made fun of for some stupid reason. I would see other people my age wear shades of red on their lips and they didn’t get made fun of. I took it personally being a 14 year old. 

Before I really started to question my identity I had long hair that went down to my shoulders and I would wear black eyeliner and sometimes black lipstick. 

I looked so feminine and when I really started to look stuff up on the internet about being trans and when I really started to question my identity I knew I wanted to look masculine. I knew I wanted to still look somewhat feminine though. 

I finally understand and I finally know what I want. 

I want to be a man who wears makeup. I AM a man who wears makeup.

I want to grow some nice facial hair and compliment it with shades of dark red and burgundy tones. 

You know how sometimes you buy new clothes and you put together the PERFECT outfit in your head? 

Well I want to wear a nude binder and I want to put my sequin jacket over it. I want to wear that rainbow bow tie From goodwill and I want to wear some fucking makeup. 

Two months ago before I cut my hair impromptu I stood in front of my bathroom mirror with my binder, sequin jacket and bow tie. 

I felt soo euphoric.

I thought to myself “I love this” 

I loved it so so much I can’t even begin to explain how amazing it felt.

I looked in the mirror and I loved myself and I loved everything about that moment.

I know who I am and I know who I want to be and it feels so good to stop repressing your feelings and to finally understand who you are and it feel so good to feel like you CAN be who you are.

But despite that, some days I wake up and say, damn, I feel great today. \n\nLately, I just want to be Taylor. Just fucking call me Taylor and try not to call me a man.  My old name hurts, and these old wounds haven\'t healed. \n\nTldr: dysphoria sucks, pronouns are important, and dead-naming is painful (even if nobody knows your new name). \n\nI hope this helped someone else.

1293,2019-09-24 11:41:16,d8lyc4,6,4,"Hi there,

The company I work for has recently moved into a new office which currently has gender neutral toilets - that being that each of the toilets are their own cubical ""room"" with each one having no gender specifics.

Upon moving into the new office, management have put up a board with ""office suggestions"" on where people can write suggestions down on what they would like to see in this new space.

The current most upvoted request (upvoted by +1's on the board) is ""**women only toilets**"".

This to me seems to be discrimination against not only non binary people, but also men and trans women who are not comfortable using explicitly designated women or mens toilets.

&amp;#x200B;

The question I wanted to ask was that I am right in saying that this is discrimination?

For my undergraduate senior exhibition project, I am compiling a series of comic book issues focused on LGBTQA themes. I am creating a comic book issue about stories for each major letter of the LGBTQA acronym and want to include a more diverse selection of stories from primary sources rather than hunting around for accounts written by journalists and authors. I have chosen to survey Reddit for research because I have done it multiple times in the past and feel the platform is great for reaching a wide and diverse audience.

**Why survey?**

Because I am not a gay man, I am not a queer person of color, I am not Asexual (and so on). The goal is to show off personal queer experiences and what is the point if I disingenuously write a perspective I do not understand? 

The stories can be as short as you want, even just 2-3 sentences, and yours may be adapted into a short 2-3 page comic in one of my comic books. 

**I will not be profiting off of this work but you might help me get a job! :\^)**

# THE SURVEY WILL CLOSE ON OCTOBER 8TH AT 11:00 PM CDT

1342,2019-09-25 00:51:13,d8w4g7,4,22,"I firmly believe I should not have to do this, but I'm becoming really desperate. But I need some advice, maybe consolation, I don't know. Something to help me deal with the fact that I have to do this for my safety.

I'm AFAB and nonbinary. I get she'd to death like...every day. I don't really pass. I've been a good soldier, I've handled it the best I could, I've never yelled at anyone besides my parents (who were very abusive and transphobic) for it...but it's starting to destroy me. So I'm trying to compromise by letting people I trust use he/him pronouns and masc words for me under specific circumstances when talking to others, and using them on myself with people I suspect will give me grief for being nonbinary.

My fiancee's grandmother refuses to accept they/them pronouns and insists it's ""just because of grammar"" no matter how much we explain that she uses singular they in her daily language damn near every day. But I suspect it's just subtle semi-malicious transphobia, whether she's aware of it or not. I suggested we try he/him with her, but I have a gut feeling deep down it's not worth it, and that she's going to keep calling me she because I don't pass and she has issues with trans people outside of the grammar issue that isn't really an issue. In fact, I'll find out in mere minutes if that went over well, because my fiancee is talking to her about it on her way home from work.

I gave my family/friends the right to use their own discretion when it comes to using he/him versus they/them, because I trust them and their judgement. I'm ding this to mitigate damage and make things easier on me but I can't get over the fact that I am literally compromising on my entire identity to decrease how much harm someone else's bigotry can cause me. It shouldn't be a thing. And I feel that it causes harm to more than just me. Feel that it skirts around being persistent and asserting that one's identity is to be respected. Which could make the people I compromise with feel content to misgender other nonbinary people and stall change overall.

I get she\'d to death like...every day. I don\'t really pass. I\'ve been a good soldier, I\'ve handled it the best I could, I\'ve never yelled at anyone besides my parents (who were very abusive and transphobic) for it...but it\'s starting to destroy me.

But I suspect it\'s just subtle semi-malicious transphobia, whether she\'s aware of it or not. I suggested we try he/him with her, but I have a gut feeling deep down it\'s not worth it, and that she\'s going to keep calling me she because I don\'t pass and she has issues with trans people outside of the grammar issue that isn\'t really an issue.

It shouldn\'t be a thing. And I feel that it causes harm to more than just me. Feel that it skirts around being persistent and asserting that one\'s identity is to be respected.

Here are some things that say MUCH more about me as a person than my pronouns ever will: I'm a die-hard Queen fan, strawberry milk is my lifeblood (the REAL stuff, none of that fake syrupy artificial crap), I have a opal-y betta fish son named Aziraphale, I'm an illustrator, and stereoscopic (3D) photography is my hobby.

I started going to therapy for other reasons, but eventually “gender” became a big thing that wasn’t getting resolved. I was on egg_irl for most of that time; started going to genderqueer support groups. I changed therapists about a month ago. My new therapist is a genderqueer lesbian. I first started experimenting with femme dress since this past June.

Today: I went into my therapist’s office with my chipped non-binary flag color nails (also I swapped yellow out for gold, cuz imma be extra) and talked about my events, including an upcoming wedding, for which I bought a dress, heels, and too much makeup and nail polish. My therapist asked me for pictures, and I showed them pictures of myself in 2 different dresses. (I bought my first one in June for a goth festival). They asked me if I ever felt like one gender over the other. I said, “Depends on the day; how I feel; what I’m doing; people I’m seeing” and they immediately nodded and said, “sounds non-binary to me.” I immediately felt relief and validity.

This is not because of hatred of how I look, or anything like that. Mostly I just have this fear that if people see my face or body then they'll start thinking of me as a girl, subconsciously (I'm AFAB). I just want to be viewed as who I am, and the gender I am. 

I know that we've all been conditioned by society to automatically assign genders to strangers based on their appearance - even trans people and allies may do it accidentally. I just worry that people will see my face and have the internal reaction of ""that's a girl!"", even if they're supportive of trans people. Obviously I can't police people's thoughts or judge them for feelings they can't help. But if I just refuse to show my face at all, then I won't have to worry about it happening! 

I've come to really dislike the fact that I have this mindset, though. It limits my behavior and social interaction with people online, including the kinds of things I'm able to post. Sometimes I actually do want to post pictures that show my body or face - like to show off my clothing style and such - but those worries prevent me from taking that step.

Seeing all the amazing comments from you, and all the upvotes, really helped me. So after the full day, I decided to go to the after party in the same outfit.

1541,2019-09-28 18:19:41,dajove,17,15,"CW: trans confusion, sexuality, dysphoria

As a trans femme non binary person starting HRT soon (really excited and nervous, also trying to deal with the premise \[internalized transphobia lmao\] that I'm ""only doing any of this"" because i'm a 'wristlet' and 'failed normie') i'm always confused by the differentiation between ""non-binary and trans"" people. I really dislike when people say ""nonbinary and trans."" On one hand, I appreciate the inclusion because when you just say ""trans people"" one assumes you are only talking about trans binary people, and while I find it important to actively include nonbinary people in your trans dialogue, the inherent ""othering"" makes me uncomfortable. I see a lot of binary trans women who seek to separate themselves from nonbinary femmes.

I've met two people that use the term genderqueer but also say they aren't trans. Coincidentally(?) these two individuals also struck me as pretty transphobic . One of them in particular actually told me that I should be fine using grindr and that I should be fine being referenced and seen as a man. ""Well, I'm genderqueer and I don't care when people call me a man"" telling me, a trans femme dysphoric nonbinary person that I should be content with whatever identity is bestowed upon me by grindr hookups. This is the same person that wanted to go on chaturbate and pretend to be a pre HRT trans woman ""for fun,"" a response to my other friend, who is trans masculine, navigating cam modelling as a trans person. Even having sex pre HRT for me is honestly super triggering and dissociative as fuck. 

Funnily enough, I actually realized I needed to go on HRT through my sexuality. When I would fantasize during masturbation, I would sort of block myself out. One day, instead of blocking myself out, for some reason, I imagined my body on HRT. It was a huge turn on and for the first time in my entire life I felt comfortable in my sexuality. I realized that I couldn't comfortably perform sex or intimacy because the body I am currently occupying isn't a body I can operate through authentically. I don't know how to slip into the role of a gay male, so I simply dissociate through the entire encounter. This realization was huge for me.

TLDR: I guess I'm wondering why people refer to themselves as nonbinary but non trans. To me, being nonbinary is solely a trans identity and people who operate outside of gender norms without being trans are simply gender nonconforming cis people, and I love and appreciate y'all.

Being exposed to all types of porn in the Navy, especially in Europe, I found a lot of it repulsive, especially if it was degrading to women.

I used to pick androgynous clothes for myself, but then I realized I don\'t have any curves and in order to be recognized as a woman I\'d have to pick more feminine outfits that I don\'t actually want to wear.\n\nThis isn\'t me saying ""I\'m a cis woman who wants to be more feminine"" because I feel I\'m not a woman at all and remember feeling that way as a child as well. It scares me because I worry I won\'t be accepted if I live authentically. I almost feel like having a feminine face and body would free me up to behave and dress how I actually want to. I just feel like if I could conform, I\'d be happy, but it feels like lying to myself.

How many locations in this small city are going to take a look at my assigned gender and tell me I need to present myself in a specific, gender-coded manner?\n\nThis is why I despise gender-roles, this is why I cannot stand being boxed in and labeled because of my birth-gender. Why are others allowed to have the things I  want simply because of what is in their pants? Where's the equality in that? Is doing that not the very definition of sexism?\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir here but it just makes zero sense to me and I'm currently pretty angry about it. I'm not cutting my hair, I'm not changing myself to fit their backwards expectations. I was going to wait and dye my hair after finding a job and asking them if it would be okay, but you know what? **FUCK IT**, I'm dying my hair and going job hunting while sporting purple locks because I'm sick of this shit and I've lost a lot of fucks recently."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I was denied a job interview because my hair was too long.', 'created': 1569911103.0}"

I realize I can Google most of this info but I'd rather get advice from people who've experienced estrogen HRT and or top surgery. But here's some things I'm curious about. Apologies for anything triggering.

1) I already have pretty stereptypically ""feminine"" features (softer jawline, bigger lips, rounded face, and a not very prominent Adam's apple), would HRT be redundant when I can often pass? Would I be better off just getting hair removal and some minor cosmetic surgery?

2) If I do HRT, what can I expect? I've heard about losing muscle mass and I know it makes you sterile.
I'm fairly active so the muscle mass might not be a huge issues (I do like my smallish muscles as they give me a semi-butch look). I've already determined I don't want children so sterility doesn't scare me. I figure I can freeze some sperm if I have second thoughts. 
Will I gain weight? Will it be harder to avoid belly and thigh fat as I get older? Are there emotional side effects? I assume so since hormones have a lot to do with your emotional responses.

3) If I get breast implants, will I lose sensation in my nipples? I know this might be an odd concern, but my nipples are a major erogenous zone, part of what makes me feel like I was ""supposed"" to have breasts. Losing that sensitivity kind of worries me. I've heard of cis women having issues with nipple sensitivity after a boob job, but these could be low quality procedures or urban legends. 

4) What happens if I detransition? Will my body revert to its pre-transition state? Will my chest go flat again? Will I start growing heavier body hair again? I feel kinda silly asking all this stuff, especially at my age.

5) Speaking of age, is there an ideal range for medical transition? I'm sure the older I get the harder it will be to recover from the surgical aspects, but could the HRT also give me trouble? AMAB people start to lose testosterone around their 40s right? And that's usually when AFAB people would be hitting menopause, so I don't know what that means for someone transitioning in their late 30s-early 40s.

This past month, I've managed to pull together 1100 dollars outside of what is budgeted so that I could take care of my guitar and start playing again, buy some essential toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, and maybe some bath stuff, and most importantly clothes and makeup. Part of it came from severance that was long overdue from a shitty situation with a previous employer, then from selling stuff that was important to me but was worth it to do something nice for myself for once.

Somehow, every single time I had any money in my hand, it had to immediately go right back out. I had to jump in and cover gaps because most people around me can't budget and we constantly were short on necessary funds. Moreover, it wasn't readily apparent that this would be something that would leave me extremely upset, and I had to point out and explain just why I would be so bothered by it. Like, look guys, I know I'm the one that keeps this family out of the shit and moving toward improvement and cares for everyone, but I have desires and feelings too. I know it's easy to not notice me, but come the fuck on, really? Even my romantic partners?

Between this, struggles with depression and isolation, struggles with not being able to work because of fatigue, I'm just done with this past month. I told my wife if the money situation doesn't sort itself out and the group come together instead of trying to each be an island to themselves, I was out. It shouldn't be the two most depressed members of the group carrying everyone else, while the other two callously blow money on bullshit. I submitted a financial plan for the entire house because this is not happening again, and if it does, I'm jumping ship.

I just wanted to get some fucking clothes. Do something nice for myself for once in my life instead of putting everything I have into the care of others. Just some fucking clothes with money I got on the side so as to not depend on someone else for something that serves only me. 1100 dollars.

But hey, at least I got 6 sets of strings for my guitar, a cleaning set for it, and am playing again. (Until the pots on it fucked right off soon after and I had to open a credit line to pay for a simple repair since SOMEHOW I don't have any money)

Oh, and some cheap deodorant and cheap shampoo and conditioner because I refused to not at least buy that for myself.

tl;dr - I raised 1100 dollars of money for myself to buy clothes, necessities, and a couple other things, but because of poor financial discipline of two partners in the house, almost none of it went to me, and I'm extremely upset over it.",trans,"Okay, it stopped being funny the fifth time it happened...",1567379538.0,"{'created_utc': 1567354338, 'id': 'cybuo4', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ""&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/fb7cxdkkb0k31.png\n\n \n\nThis past month, I've managed to pull together 1100 dollars outside of what is budgeted so that I could take care of my guitar and start playing again, buy some essential toiletries like shampoo, conditioner, and maybe some bath stuff, and most importantly clothes and makeup.

So yeah I'm like a toddler in terms of how I should act what I should do to be femenine and all that stuff

So um first of all I always knew I was bisexual even before knowing I was trans, so it usually never gave me any insecurities saying out loud that I liked both the puss and the dicc, until recently I been seeing some comments on stuff i watch to inform myself about, well myself, and I found its commonly bad seen for a tgirl to be a lesbian, while I'm not a lesbian per say, I'm technically half lesbian, so like it feels like I'm being forced to only look at half the people I like... Not that it makes much of a difference on my dating life since I'm still a fucking virgin, although that is mostly because it's uncomfortable and really easy trying to get lost of that you're supposed to do in those situations.

So yeah, uh question 1 I guess?

 Is it alright for a tgirl to also like girls?



Next I would like tackle the little doubt I have about how far should I take it with my transition

I'm extremely lucky for I pass even without having hormones on me, I just need a good depilation and you won't know what I have between my legs unless I open my mouth, curse you puberty!, because of this I focus myself more on the voice training, the make-up and the clothes part of which I'll tackle later, but again it appears to be common that unless you get hormones for 5 years and you do the snip snap to that meaty deformed looking lil guy between your legs, cis people and elitist lgbt+ people wont treat you with the respect they would otherwise, even if when they first met you they said ""she"" because they didn't even know you were trans at all... Sorry if I'm flexing to much that I'm passing without great effort, I know it's a very rare and unfair privilege but gimme my 10 seconds of pride please, I don't get to have it the rest of the year... Fecking dysphoria is strong on this one, specially because my parents still try to say ""he"" when the ""she"" escapes from their mouths unconsciously

So question 2: should I do hormones and or surgeries?, I feel like I would really enjoy getting that E boost and the T down, but the surgeries on the other hand, they scare me, besides I have a little fantasy of myself that I'm a ""lesbian with a permanent strap on"" xd



And finally... Could someone give me some fashion tips?

51,2019-09-02 01:53:16,cyiqc8,7,3,"Okay, quick background summary before I get into this: I'm AMAB transfemme nonbinary, and I started HRT 8 months ago, in my late thirties.

I don't expect any easy answers here, but it would really help if others shared their own experiences...? It would be really validating. 😊 I'm hoping to hear from trans women, nonbinary people, and perhaps even AFAB members decribing their own contrasting experience.

Here's what's on my mind:

--------

I started progesterone a few weeks ago, and my breast development has picked up. Part of me is happy about this, but it's also a big adjustment and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I keep looking down and asking myself “do I want this permanently?...” I like the changes to how I look, but some thoughts keep getting in my way.

The first thought is obvious: the memory of being raised in a society that says “you shouldn't have breasts!!” Sooo, knowing how people might react scares me a little. I don't even care so much what people on the street *think,* but I do worry what people will *do,* and how it will affect my professional and personal life. I'm hoping people's way of thinking continues to catch up with us, but it may or may not happen quickly enough. 😞

The second is a bit more insidious. You see, I was skinny as a rail in high school, but since then I've gained 20-30 pounds. With that extra weight came filled-out breasts. Some transfemmes *like* this, but to me they were “manboobs,” so it gave me what might've counted as dysphoria.

Consequently, when I feel my chest fill out under my arms as the breast tissue spreads, I can't help but partially associate it with male weight gain. :/ I'm hoping that continued growth — especially filling out underneath — will help me to subconsciously separate these two types of chest bulk.

Lastly, there's just the fact that they're naturally a little sore and tender during development, and that discomfort hampers the gender euphoria I'm otherwise experiencing. :/

Second post on here, I think it'll do better. I've seen rant posts so I kind of just want to share my experience because why not. It feels good to know that people might see this, and maybe learn from my experiences. So here it is: 

My parents suck. They just do. If I was cis, my mom would have no problem supporting me(she's said it herself. Come out as bi/les–NO PROBLEM! Come out as her son, oh man, it's all going down.) As mentioned in the parentheses, a few weeks ago, I had the semi-courage to send an extremely lengthy text conveying my wish for being her son. I realise I shouldn't have said this. I should have said I WAS her son, not WISHED to be. Aside from that, she texted back a few minutes later that she didn't understand but that she would always support me. Weight lifted off of my shoulders, right? Absolutely wrong. When I got back from my mini-vacation, my mom told me that I couldn't get my hair cut as short as I wanted to because of my father. I cried, alright, because my hair is one of the primary sources of my dysphoria, unfortunately. My hair makes me look so dang feminine with my  A L R E A D Y  feminine features. Cue some more crying and I finally re-bring up the subject of my coming out saying that I hated being a girl and I hated my name because at that point I just snapped like a rubber band. I went in the backyard and blared some of my music, as peaceful as my music is(lol). A few minutes later I got a text from my mom saying that I would always be a girl, I'd always be Magnolia, and nothing could that. She said ""I hope you'll find a way to come to terms with yourself"" and ""God doesn't make mistakes"". Oh boy, I was like a bull that had seen red after the God statement. In anger, I texted my non-binary friend, who was the first person I came out to(In a Bath and Body Works, mind you). They are a super amazing person, who I've ranted to quite a bit, had quite a few midnight convos with. Anyway, my mother came outside to a sight of me crying. Quite angrily. I was just plain mad at her. Well, she sat down and said that God made me a girl for a reason and all that(basically rephrasing her texts) and that it was still ""us against the world"" I said that it wasn't anymore because she wouldn't accept me and she just replied with ""God doesn't make mistakes you put these ideas in your head yourself"". Of course, I couldn't believe she'd take the words of some imaginary being over her own SON. That's right, for those of you in the back, I said son. So that was the final straw in me becoming an atheist, but yeah, I went inside and to my room ready to get out. To go away. I was packing my bags while texting one of my friends to ask where I could go. Well, that day ended and I didn't run away and now we're here, a little more than a month later, and I'm still enduring every misgender and deadnaming. It's hard, it truly is. I hate the stupid nickname that she calls me every time she wants to summon me. (KK is so ****ing stupid and if I hear it again I'm going to explode) I hate my dad being so transphobic. I hate every time someone in my family says that I'm a girl and I'll always be one like do you know I have the power to change that when I'm eighteen and oh boy, believe me, I will! One day I will get surgery and hormones and you're gonna feel like a dang fool ain't ya? One day I'll refuse to be deadnamed, I'll move to a different country if I have to. I wanted to join the military but well, I'm not sure if that foolish ban'll be removed by the time I'm eighteen. I can serve my country just as well as the next guy, but the people who make a bad name for us truly make me feel less patriotic. How can I be proud of us as a nation if we're reverting back to the same way we were a hundred years ago? I can't even come out to my parents(again) in fear of what they'll do. I wish they would kick me out, I really do. I have a wonderful best friend who's willing to take me in and I would much rather live with their family than mine. Why did it have to turn out like this, anyway? I'm not sure when I'm ever going to fully happy again and the adults blame it on ""teenage hormones"", which I absolutely hate. For telling the doctor my true feelings I was scolded, told to quit acting ""depressed"" when I wasn't. When ""that wasnt me"". I'm sorry mother/father, have you been in my head? Have you despised being born the wrong way? No, exactly! My parents aren't even willing to try to understand, aren't even trying to help. My mother ignored my coming out, acting like it never happened, like it doesn't exist. My father's too afraid of my hair being short because I'll ""look like a d*ke""(sorry I censored, I just find the word offensive because it's just plain rude). I try to tell him that millions of girls(although I'm not one ;)) have their hair short and they aren't homosexual. Older women? Apparently all have a raging case of gay to my father. I hate fighting wars to just be who I am. Why can't I have suits? Why can't I be myself? I am so tired of having to live life as a girl at my house and getting so much backlash for my apparently ""fake depression"" that I just want a break.  I'm not trying to flaunt ""oh uWu I'm a dEpreSSeD sM0L bEaN"", I just want to feel better and right now music is the only thing that can take me away from my drifting. I feel like I'm just drifting through a sea of seeking. I always want to be doing something, I always want to be busy. I can't help it and it eats at me constantly. I'm trapped in my small town though (with a population of 6000 or 16000, last time I checked). I want to get in my dream car and keep driving until I reach safety, until I reach acceptance, but right now the only place where I feel I'm semi-accepted is school. Funny, how much I want to be there sometimes. I'm just tired of never feeling satisfied, of always looking for something. I just want to be called a son, for the first time. I want to be treated as an individual, not a statistic(what I feel like I am in my parents eyes–just another ""troubled youth"" who wants to rebel). I just want to feel like myself.

I salute you if you've read all of this, and I hope you have a safe rest of your days. We might never cross paths, you and I, but you, stranger, have just read my feeling poured out on a body of text. You might not know it, but you helped. It helps knowing I don't carry a burden alone sometimes, (and my poor NB friend shouldn't have to listen to my ranting 24/7). I'm going to say that if anyone needs someone to talk to that they might never see, or know who they are, I am here.

However, there are problems. I don't live with them, but my family is mostly comprised of devout Southern Baptists.

Hey I feel like I could use some advice from anyone who feels like sharing so im just going to throw this out there with minimal preamble.

So I am a 24 year old biological male who has been playing with the idea of undergoing MtF hormone thereapy. I had begun crossdressing in private as soon as  I moved out from my parents place for college but for a lo g time just figured it was a kink or just somthing I had enjoyed but not actually part of me.

 Where im struggling is that though I know there is no one box to fit all trans people in or any ""correct"" way to be trans I felt that i didnt fit into the expectations most people think about what a trans person is like. Im not attracted to men, not into pink dresses, I never felt like playing with dolls as a kid, that kind of thing so I figured I can crossdress as a hobby and everything would just be fine. However now I feel more and more that I'm having a hard time starting relationships or getting very close to freinds feeling as though is anyone got too close to me as a person they will figure out my secret and ill be be ousted as some kind of pervert or some nonsense like that.

As it stands I am coming to terms with my gender identity and trying to live more open and authentically. For the first time in my life I have been thinking very seriously about coming out and transitioning but I feel as though i am trapped somewhere between knowing that I cant keep living in secret and simultainiously terrified about how my life will change and the challenges I would face once I come out. Im sure the majority of my family would support me or at the very least be civil but im scared about work, freinds, will I be passable, can I get a feminine voice down all the standard stuff.

With that in mind if anyone out there lived a similar situaltion to mine and wants to share what was it that pushed you past the fear of coming out?

120,2019-09-03 04:04:21,cyzsys,0,4,"My Trans Life...
It is hard not to think about it as of late as it seems to be the only thing that ever gets talked about or recognized. I would like to say a few things about this. To all. 
I don't know how many times I have been told that I should be proud that I am transgender. I should be proud of coming out. I should be proud that I ""pass"" as a woman. Can I say that being transgender just fucking sucks? 
At least when I wasn't out, it was mine. Mine to hold. Mine to protect. Mine alone. Now that I am out I have lots to worry about. Let me say that this isn't a fad. This isn't trendy. This isn't cool. This isn't just something to be. It's hard. And it's hell. And more often than not, it is not full of unicorns, sunshine, daisies, and rainbows. It isn't always successes and wonderful transition photos. 
No, it's the sleepless nights. The endless thinking about my fears. It's the wondering if I should and can or will use a public restroom. Or which restroom should I use. 
It's the constant reminders of my childhood past and how I was treated horribly. It's the having to constantly come out to medical providers, insurance providers, bosses, coworkers, therapists, program coordinators, lovers, new friends, strangers, practically everyone I meet. It's about being asked all the time ""how did you know and when."" It's about being asked what's between my legs rather than what's in my heart and mind. 
It's losing family because their religious beliefs and personal opinions view me as a sin, an abomination, a freak, an outcast, a loser, a mistake. It's looking into my parents eyes as a child and seeing their disgust, disapproval, shame, guilt, and embarrassment. It's the acceptance of my cis friends who mean well and think it's cool but don't have an inkling of what I go through or what i've been through the last 22 years of my life. 
It's the confusion of maybe dating men because they get concerned that they will be considered gay for dating a trans woman. It's dealing with the butterflies and anxiety in my stomach when I have to show my ID and my appearance doesn't match the documents. It's the realization that I will never have the financial or insurance status to get the painful surgeries to transition my body into a woman physically, so I can at least feel a sense of comfortability in my own damn skin. It's the cold hard truth of waking up every morning in a body that was never mine to begin with and looking in the mirror and being disgusted and disappointed by what I see because it does not match how I feel on the inside. Or by the lack of cleavage or hips and the sound of my voice that always gives me away even if I am all dressed up in female attire. It's about being stuck in the middle between my birth sex and my authentic gender. 
It's about having to go through puberty and childhood again, but this time at lightning speed with no guidance but my own experience and insight. It's about being reborn and having to grow up again because I never really was out in the first place to begin with because I got stuck with a family, that no one can choose, who disowned me and devalued my worth as a girl. It's about going out everyday in this evil fucking world knowing I will never be safe or secure because I had a family and have a society that taught me and continues to teach me that their opinions and views of me are more important than my own. 
It's the worrying about the creeps that may want to feel me up or hit on me to see if I have all the parts to match. It's the constant hypervigilance of those haters that want to really hurt me or kill me for being transgender because it so happens. It's always going out with my knife and pepper spray ready to stream as to feel some sense of safety and protection. It's about the never ending and repeating of facts by society that tell me why I am not a woman and never will be. It's being told that I don't have ovaries or fallopian tubes or a vagina or eggs therefore I can't give birth to a baby. It's the knowing and constant realistic and biological reminder that yes I don't have the parts to have a baby. Therefore I will never be able to give birth to my own baby, my own child, my own blood. And know what it is like to have a beautiful person growing inside of me and to be so close to someone for 9 whole months and watch my tummy grow and be so proud of such an experience and a blessing. It's knowing that I will never be a true mom in society's or the world's eyes. It's being told that I don't menstruate or don't have periods so I can't know what it is to be a woman. 
It's the objectification and worrying about why men look at me like a sex object and thing they have every right to lok at me like that and just degrade my humanity and womanhood. It's the looks and comments from cis women or cis men and the feeling of disgust and hatred from the two things. It's being called a monster, freak, whore, cunt, wannabe, fake, tranny, fag/faggot, queer, sex offender, sinner, gay, mother fucker, etc. 
It's the always to having to have my heart guarded and guard up because I know I can't afford to be viewed or considered weak or vulnerable. It's the self-loathing and constant hate for my body and self because I was taught to hide my true self and that I should be ashamed of that. It's having to build a whole new support network through social media and LGBTQ programs to replace the lack of acceptance from those I had loved or had a fucking responsibility to love and accept me because that is what a mother and father are supposed to do for their child. It's not so much about others' acceptance as it is the struggle to love myself when my family and the world continues to tell me otherwise.
There I finally said it. It's all out. In a nutshell. This is just one small part of who I am as I am made up of so much more. This is nothing to glamorize. Because when you really get down to it, I and others like me have some battle or fight or hell or obstacle that we have to go through just to be the people we have always known ourselves to be that many know nothing about. While dealing with the same, daily, regular, life stressors as our peers in our lives. So to all, be kind and gentle and compassionate to one another.

Her family was pretty conservative and despite being pansexual she had never dated a girl because of them. She also made sure that I never mentioned anything about my sexuality being other than straight. When I came out she fought it right away. She continuously asked me if I was sure, she refused to tell her parents or let me present around them, and she was adamantly against me starting hormones. 

After I came out the relationship completely imploded. Despite her saying she was pansexual, she didnt find me romantically attractive anymore. After two months of agonizing awkwardness we agreed to end the relationship. Since ending the relationship we have still hung out, and even told her family that I'm trans. There isn't any chance that we are going to get back together, and I dont want to. It feels like she can have me as a friend but I wasnt good enough to date her. 

When i think about her like even just for a split second in passing, my heart starts beating really hard; I get panicked. I have no idea why this is happening, any insight would be much appreciated.

I know of someone whose major concern with getting bottom surgery (phallo) is the crazy scarring of the grafted area(s) and how obvious it can be that you've had skin taken for something.

He's already had top surgery, so it's not like an idea like this could help him, but I wonder for people who haven't had any surgery yet, would the skin from the breast area be viable for use to avoid taking skin from elsewhere and minimising what can be very bad scarring, assuming they want top surgery and are having that skin taken anyway.

I'm sure one drawback would be that you would need to have two surgeries in short succession which is dangerous. But I've heard of plastic surgeries being performed together to minimise healing time and costs, which could be an argument for it...

I'm going to a trade school, its remote so there's not a lot going on around us, just woods.

This in turn directs a lot of... Hate, dis-content, homophobia, Transphobia, confusion, etc right on my shoulders. At first, I was okay with explaining it all. I shared my life, my struggles and pain with the people on this campus. I was warned that I was the first open Transgender student at this particular campus and that I would be treated equally. Okay. 


Its been months now. I've been called: Faggot, tranny, heshe, ""It"" in addition to the phrases:


""You're just a nigga""

""Do you have a pussy?""

""Do you have a dick?""

""You have a dick, stop lying""

""Your a heterosexual male""

""Your confused""

""Did you get the surgery?""

""when are you getting the surgery?""

""when are you getting your procedure done?""

""Did I just your feelings?""

""I call everyone Bro""

""I say dude to everyone""

""I'm not with that gay shit""

""I'm not gay, I don't like you like that""

I got into an intimate relationship. That was one big shit show. I got into an actual relationship, and I'm happy.

She sees me for who I really am and I genuinely love her. However the campus doesn't see it that way. I look a certain way (masculine, very male). However we're both considered Females in their records, thus we both live in the female dorms. I know what they think. I know what's written into my file. ""Student keeps entering student (B)'s room"" ughhh. Give me a break. Staff member hot with the: ""No PDA"", ""We don't need anymore (School name here) Babies"". We're not slow. Sigh*. What can I do? Go outside? Maybe a stroll around the campus only to be met with: ""Get a room""  (We had one, y'all took it away because y'all thought we were fucking). My favourite ""Aw look at the couples, the cute and the ugly"" 

Bitch please. You wish you has these cheekbones. And my girlfriend is thicc two C's. 


Other girls, hate em.

This is really hard for me to talk about. I just joined Reddit so I could get help. I'm not well.

Dr. Rumer butchered me and dealing with her office to get a resolution has been a fucking NIGHTMARE. I need help NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW. I'm not ok! I need help! Please help! Let me explain...

I'm a 35-yr old trans-woman. I had bottom surgery with Dr. Kathy Rumer in May 2017. Up until July 2018, Dr. Rumer told me how ""beautifully"" I was healing when I'd see her for a post-op check-up. That seems like her go-to word for every check-up: ""beautiful."" In July 2018, I had minor surgery right in her office to remove some granulation tissue. At that time, I also told her that I was bleeding almost every time I dilate for a month. She told me I needed surgery under ""twilight sedation"" to fix much deeper granulation tissue. She told me that it's very rare for someone to develop granulation tissue like this a year after bottom surgery. A few months later, she said she never said that. I couldn't have just pulled ""twilight sedation"" out of my ass. She told me something, and then said she didn't say it.

Her office is horrible at handling insurance. I waited and waited and waited on pre-authorization from insurance. Dr. Rumer's office doesn't make outbound calls to insurance providers. I had to have my health insurance company call her office. Whenever I deal with Dr. Rumer's office, I have to be the liaison for my insurance company and her office. It's horrible. They've had so many problems processing the correct procedures codes, dates, etc. You all don't know how many times I've had to call my insurance company and then start a 3-way conference call with Dr. Rumer's office.

I have literally emailed and called Dr. Rumer's office over 100 times. I've explained to them every moment my symptoms have gotten worse and worse.

I'm not a doctor by any means. Dr. Rumer told me originally that I needed surgery under twilight sedation, then she said she didn't say that, and then she later told me I needed major surgery under general anesthesia at Hahnnemen University Hospital (which I think actually closed now!). Last time I saw her, she said she wanted to take some of my belly fat for a skin graft in my vagina, and it would take another year to heal. She said it would be like starting from scratch again, as if it was the a brand new bottom-surgery. Oh joy. That's my layperson understanding of this.

It's hard to remember, but we were starting to discuss choosing a revision date right around the end of December 2018/early 2019. Then we were supposed to book for February or March, but her office simply couldn't figure out how to handle insurance, and THEN they put me on a wait list to have surgery on July 17, 2019. I kept insisting to them that I couldn't wait that long. I needed urgent help a year and a half ago. I meed much MORE urgent help now. It's September and I still haven't had revision surgery. I honestly lost a ton of weight from severe depression. About 2 weeks before I was supposed to have revision surgery, Dr. Rumer's associate (or family member?) Teri Rumer called me to cancel the surgery because I didn't weigh enough. I've gained much of that weight since then, but it's too fucking late now. I SHOULD HAVE HAD THIS WHEN THE DOCTOR ORIGINALLY TOLD ME OVER A YEAR AGO. It's been too long. 

Below are my current symptons. This is not going to be easy for me to write, and it's really personal and gross. So, sorry in advance.

At this point, I can BARELY dilate. My dilators have 5 dots on them to measure depth. Now I can only get half-way to the first dot on my smallest purple dilator. I used to be able to get to the 4th dot on the medium-size dilator, and the 3rd dot on the largest dilator. Currently, I barely have a fucking vagina. It's a joke. It's a baby-sized vagina/wound. I'm still bleeding. I'm getting gross green discharge. Sometimes it smells really bad and I'm extremely embarrased and hate myself. I'm becoming more depressed and asocial. Dr. Rumer's office literally told me to just do the best I can and iodine-douche every 2 days. It's completely pointless. I don't have a fucking vagina. I have a mystery wound hole.

I live right near Manhattan. I'm trying to set up an appointment to see Dr. Jess Ting. I need a new surgeon. I also quite possibly need a lawyer. **Any lawyers reading this??? My symptons and complaints are WELL-DOCUMENTED in all of my emails to Dr. Rumer's office**.

Dr. Rumer completely fucked up my body. I am completely unable to have sex, and it's driving me fucking crazy.

I'm sorry if this isn't the most well-written thing, or if there are gaps in my backstory. This has been an extremely traumatizing experience for me. I'm basically winging it and referring back to old notes as I type it, but I'm not exactly the most mentally sound at the moment.

Unfortunately after I came out, we had a falling out. We reconciled over time and he accepted what I chose. Last year, I dressed as Ilsa Lund (Ingrid in Casablanca) for Halloween party.

169,2019-09-04 01:08:30,czdudz,1,2,"I (m18) have been having thoughts lately about my gender. Sorry if my wording is weird I’ve never posted to reddit and I’m not a good writer, but I’m posting here on a secret account of mine cuz I don’t want people in my life knowing that I’m having thoughts like this. Sorry again if my wording is all over the place, I have a lot of thoughts and Im bad at describing my thoughts.

Growing up I’ve always been a tad feminine, but I’ve just blamed that on being gay (I’m still trying to figure my sexual orientation out). I don’t remember this but my mother says I would take her dresses and put them on and say, “i am a girl”. She was fine with it but my father didn’t approve. I do remember looking at my sister when she would wear ponytails and I would kinda be jealous of her being able to have long hair and being able to design it and change it up and accessorize which I wasn’t able to do because I had short boy hair. I always wanted to wear dresses and twirl around in them because the idea just felt freeing. 

I did stop having those thoughts for a while, and I began questioning my sexual orientation in middle school. I decided I was bi/gay. I also struggled a little bit with pronouns. Sometimes I only wanted he/him, other times I didn’t really care, and sometimes I didn’t really like he/him.
(At the moment I still really don’t care that much about my pronouns to me they are just words and if someone says the wrong pronouns I’m not gonna care)

I know I like men but I don’t know about women. I’ve had crushes on women but I don’t think I’d ever be in a relationship with a women. As a male I’m not interested in sexual relationships with women, but I would love the platonic parts of a relationship with a female. As a male i like men sexually and platonically. As a female I would like to be in a relationship with a man sexually and platonically. As a female I don’t think I would want a relationship with a female of any kind besides friendship. 

When I think of myself as a male it feels normal and right, but there are times when I think of myself as a women and it feels right as well (and I mean like a woman, I don’t wanna cross dress as a woman, if I were to wear woman clothes I would want to be a woman, and not the next day be a man again). When I think of myself as trans... I don’t necessarily like it. When I look at trans people (ftm, mtf) I hate myself for it but it doesn’t feel right. Everyone has their own right to express themselves the way they should be able to and if you want to be a different gender, go ahead I will support you no matter what and defend your right but there’s a little part of me that says it’s wrong and I am so sorry to everyone because I know that part of me if wrong but I can’t get rid of the feeling. Which is why I think that I can’t be trans, but is it me just trying to deny that part of me because growing up I was told I am a boy. And having everyone in my life know that I am changing to a women would just makes me feel,... wrong. I would feel like everyone is watching me and I just hate that feeling. 

I’m probably oversharing and there are definitely more thoughts I’ve had about this that I forgot, and I should be talking about this to my therapist but even telling anyone in my personal life just feels too overwhelming. If anyone has advice for me, I’m open to listening, and I’m sorry to anyone I may have offended with my comment about it feeling wrong.",trans,How do i know if I am trans?,1567584510.0,"{'created_utc': 1567559310, 'id': 'czdudz', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'I (m18) have been having thoughts lately about my gender.

However, recently after a trip to another city (where most of my family is located), she told she already talked about this with all my family, which really upset me because I didn't want to be out to them yet. Then she got mad at me, saying that 'that's what she understood from our conversation' (which I don't really understand, because I never even implied anything like that), and now is angry because apparently I dont have a right to be upset about this. 
I tried to explain to her why I was so upset but it didn't seem to work. I  also doubly upset because she has a history of saying things that I told her and wanted to keep private to her friends and acquaintances,  and she promised she would stop but clearly she hasn't because she keeps doing it. On top of that, today I am going to go see an endocrinologist, which had made me very excited, and now all that excitement is gone.

My best friend, Josh, is transgender (FTM). Sometimes he educates me on what it's like to be trans and how he deals with it. But something crossed my mind a few weeks ago, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.

Masculinity doesn't mean you're a male, just like femininity doesn't mean you're female. I've always been a hyper, over-emotional, overdramatic boy growing up. I've heard all the names in the book, being told, ""you're acting like a girl,"" or, ""quit being a pussy."" Because of that, I've learned over the years that masculinity/femininity definitely doesn't determine your gender. And people who call you out for feeling, dressing, or acting a certain way are just douche-bags in general.

Something else I've been told is, your body parts don't determine your gender either. Knowing your gender comes from what you feel. But that's what confuses me.

*What is the feeling you get when finding out that you're male/female/other? If it's not masculinity/femininity, then what is that feeling?*

That's something I asked Josh a few nights ago on the phone. He genuinely didn't have an answer, other than, ""I've never thought about that before.""

First off, I'm years past transition; like 15 years. I have no idea if I register as trans on people's radar or not anymore. I never get misgendered, or stuff like that. I get treated like your average woman. No better or worse. I don't even think about it most of the time. 

I'm at the bar, sipping my drink and a tall grey haired guy ponies up to the bar next to me. We start chatting and I learn his name is Vance and is an artist showing his work at the gallery next door. He takes out his phone and starts to show me pics of his work. As he and I look through his pics, several text messages appear on his screen. One say ""hey have a good time with makenzi"" ( referring to me) and the second one says "" lol going from straight to gay"". 

Vance and I are reading this at the same time. It barely registers with him. He's intent on his artwork and talking me through it. I can't hear him anymore because I am really disturbed by the text messages.

The guy who sent them (his name is Peter) comes by to say goodnight, not knowing that I saw the messages. After these two say ""see ya"" to each other, I follow Peter to the door and ask him how he knows me, and he says we met at the bar a while back. I told him that I saw the message. I said it wasn't very nice. He just looked sheepish and left.

Here's the thing. I have no memory of meeting him at all, and I certainly never shared my history with him. I never share it with anyone, and I would never ever do so in a bar. So what the hell.

302,2019-09-06 17:50:22,d0k105,1,9,"Dear \[REDACTED\],

I'm writing this ten years after I came out. I didn't even think that was possible. Some nights I didn't even think I'd make it through the night. I thought I'd just write to let you know that so far it's turned out okay. I'm only 24, so this isn't the end, but I feel like I've reached a checkpoint &amp; wanted to check in. This isn't an 'it gets better' letter because I always found that shit to be braggy and condescending when I was you. It doesn't just magically get better of its own accord. It gets better 'cuz you bust your ass to make it better. You work on your mental health, you find &amp; talk to therapists (real ones, not the creepy conversion therapist your mom tries to send you to). You save money and stand up for yourself and make space for yourself to blossom into the grown-ass badass being you wanted to be. You meet boys and learn to have sex on your own terms and sometimes it's kind of bad and sometimes it's so, so good.

Oh, boys. If I remember anything about what it was like to be 13 it's that I was just floating in a bubble in the sea of my desire. You're not some sicko fetishist yaoi fangirl because you read yaoi and fanfiction nonstop. It might take you a while to realize it, but you're a gay dude, and these stories written by teenage girls about Sasuke and Naruto fucking are just the only representations you have right now of what your sexuality might look like. You're gonna write some fanfiction. It's gonna be fucking cringey. Teenagers figuring out their sexuality always kind of are. Then you're gonna try to meet real boys. Now I don't plan to fill this letter with advice cuz you already know this but for fuck's sake be careful. A lot of men see a teenage baby trans boi and they think they're an opportunity to mold a girlfriend to suit them. They see a chance to 'fix' and subjugate a dykey girl that will become a more interesting wife than the average straight girl. Maybe they even see your transness as a lifeline to their own queerness that they've already suppressed. Regardless, you're no one's lifeline, and creeps like that will always drag you down. Try to stay away from them.

Of course, all of this might be easier if you like girls. It certainly would have helped me--would have helped my parents understand, would have helped me find partners, would have helped me realize I was trans and not just some kind of gay porn fetishist.

Eventually things change though. You stand up for yourself, and you keep doing it. The whole world bears down on you and you feel like you can't keep going and you hit rock bottom and then months later you wake up and there's still sunshine and birds and clouds out there and you think hey, fuck it, if I'm still here I might as well have a life worth living.

You move to Canada, you move to New York. You change your name. You finish school. You don't get top surgery but you get a breast reduction you feel weirdly about. It helps, but it's not enough. Your mom paid for it thinking it would rid you of your dysphoria and this 'phase.' You told her for years it wouldn't but eventually you decided to try anyway. It didn't. It still helped though, somewhat.

Your body is yours now. To prove it to yourself you recently got a tattoo. As the tattooer--the only woman of color you could find in rural upstate New York--carves the shaded lines into your shoulder, a sense of ownership finally blossoms in your chest. Hopefully you'll get top surgery soon, maybe even a hysterectomy one day. Either way it's up to you now and no one else. Finally you control the fate of your body.

I guess this is the point where I should mention that you get married. That probably scares you. It sure as fuck scared me. I spent my whole childhood dealing with the repercussions of my parents' divorce, watching my mom enter disaster marriage after disaster marriage. I swore that would never happen to me. I told myself that all the aunties who said ""*3o2balek*""\* at weddings and all the grandmas pressuring me were wrong. I wouldn't be married. I couldn't be tied down. And yet here I am, two weeks married.

Looking back I didn't realize how much I needed a stable queer relationship to grow into my masculinity. As a gay non-op trans dude, it often feels like your gender and your sexuality are at odds. Most straight dudes are alienated by your whole butch aesthetic, and you really really don't wanna date straight dudes anyway. Most gay dudes are alienated by your tits, and even though that feels like an injustice, there's nothing anyone can do about it. Sometimes you cover up your body to have sex, insist on only doing it with your shirt (and a binder) on. Sometimes you bare your body in ways that make you feel uncomfortable because you're so fucking horny and desperate for human contact. People will try to take advantage of that. Eventually if you're lucky you'll meet someone just as queer and strange as you are. Someone who will hold space so that the person you're blooming into can grow and flourish. Someone who loves you no matter what--long hair or none, tits or no tits.

Of course, love like that doesn't just fall out of the sky. You have to take care of yourself first. Work on your mental health, come up with your own personal style. It's only when you begin living as your true self that you attract people who are into the real you--shocking, right? But don't take this as a suggestion that you obsess over passing. I think a lot of trans people would be happier if we realized we have less control over that than we'd like to think. Maybe we don't have the money to transition, maybe we're too tall. Worrying about your height or your head size or whether your binder flattens you completely is just useless anxiety. Focus on presenting yourself in the way that feels most comfortable in the body you have. Of course, that doesn't mean you can't wear a binder if you want to. I just realized I didn't, and that I would have been way happier if I'd known from the start that wanting to be able to breathe and run and not feel my chest crushing my ribcage didn't make me less of a man. Plus, let's face it, even after breast reduction my chest is too big to bind flat. These boy titties can't be contained.

The good thing is some people will see you no matter what you look like. Despite what the last couple hundred years of Judeo-Christian-Islamic hegemony would make you think, trans people have always existed and people know that. You will have cis dude friends who see you as their brother and are willing to fight on your side. You will have girl friends who hold you up and make you feel strong--though take care not to replicate cis dudes' mistake of over-relying on girls' generosity and support. This is not a journey into the same masculinity cis dudes fucked up the world with. This is a journey out of gender altogether, and you and all our trans and enby siblings are its leaders.

I'm sure before I close this out you want to hear about the sex, though. You were always a horny little egg. Just know that gay sex isn't like the fanfiction would make you think--it's better. Fanfiction is a representation of teenagers' yearning, inexperienced sexuality and its tropes don't represent what it feels like when two boys make love. The reality is so much fuller and deeper and sweatier and scarier. Queer love takes two bodies that the world treats as alien and forges them together and purifies them into their truest essence. Queer love is something wholly of you and your lovers' making. Queer love is self-expression and self-annihilation. Also, queer love requires more attention to your rectal health than fanfiction prepares you for. Invest in a bidet.

Anyway, this letter is four pages long now and I'm sure it doesn't make any sense. I guess if I have any last wisdom to impart, it's this: you are going to grow into the person you were meant to be. It might happen soon or it might be years from now. It's a process that's both inexorable and requires a lot of hard work to get through. You can do it. After all, somehow my messy gay ass did it.

Love,

I didn\'t even think that was possible. Some nights I didn\'t even think I\'d make it through the night. I thought I\'d just write to let you know that so far it\'s turned out okay. I\'m only 24, so this isn\'t the end, but I feel like I\'ve reached a checkpoint &amp; wanted to check in. This isn\'t an \'it gets better\' letter because I always found that shit to be braggy and condescending when I was you. It doesn\'t just magically get better of its own accord. It gets better \'cuz you bust your ass to make it better. You work on your mental health, you find &amp; talk to therapists (real ones, not the creepy conversion therapist your mom tries to send you to). You save money and stand up for yourself and make space for yourself to blossom into the grown-ass badass being you wanted to be. You meet boys and learn to have sex on your own terms and sometimes it\'s kind of bad and sometimes it\'s so, so good.\n\nOh, boys. If I remember anything about what it was like to be 13 it\'s that I was just floating in a bubble in the sea of my desire. You\'re not some sicko fetishist yaoi fangirl because you read yaoi and fanfiction nonstop. It might take you a while to realize it, but you\'re a gay dude, and these stories written by teenage girls about Sasuke and Naruto fucking are just the only representations you have right now of what your sexuality might look like. You\'re gonna write some fanfiction. It\'s gonna be fucking cringey. Teenagers figuring out their sexuality always kind of are. Then you\'re gonna try to meet real boys. Now I don\'t plan to fill this letter with advice cuz you already know this but for fuck\'s sake be careful. A lot of men see a teenage baby trans boi and they think they\'re an opportunity to mold a girlfriend to suit them. They see a chance to \'fix\' and subjugate a dykey girl that will become a more interesting wife than the average straight girl. Maybe they even see your transness as a lifeline to their own queerness that they\'ve already suppressed. Regardless, you\'re no one\'s lifeline, and creeps like that will always drag you down. Try to stay away from them.\n\nOf course, all of this might be easier if you like girls. It certainly would have helped me--would have helped my parents understand, would have helped me find partners, would have helped me realize I was trans and not just some kind of gay porn fetishist.\n\nEventually things change though.

Another thing is I don't like the appearance of the skin graft for phallo and I'm concerned that the scar of the skin graft would cause me more dysphoria.

I'm going to take every answer with a grain of salt, but I will listen and consider any response. I'm trying to figure out if I'm mtf trans or just kinda psychologically deformed by sexuality... Long post ahead.....

So I've researched the topic, and I didn't necessarily grow up feeling like I belonged more with girls or preferring ""girl activities"". I grew up with only brothers, so that's just what I knew. I also didn't realize I was mixed race until I started going to public school (late elementary). I was never internally opposed to princesses and the like, but I acted like I abhorred that stuff for the sake of fitting in with the other boys. 

It was mostly shame that made me deny idea of wanting to be a girl internally. It was shameful to be a girl, or in any way effeminate. Perhaps that's fed into fetishes/kinks rather than true gender dysphoria.

I knew I was into pregnancy way before I even knew about sex. I can't remember how I reacted when I heard only women could get pregnant, but I do remember being skeptical for a bit. I think part of it was wanting to be pregnant myself, but I'm not sure.

Not too long after, I found out about the concept of being trans through some documentary or something. For some reason, my brothers and I all watched all the way through it. I think there was a CSI episode on it too. I completely misunderstood it, and thought it was a way that, if I absolutely wanted to, I could get pregnant too (I remember a story about a man who transitioned, had kids, and then de-transitioned). It kinda stuck in my head as a sort of backup plan if I wanted to abandon everything in life and start anew.

When I hit puberty, I masturbated like a girl. Like, I'd ""tuck"" and then rub it like an over-the-pants handy and that's what got me off. It was around this time I discovered my autogynophelia. It was initially the fertility, but now it's just the shape of a woman in general. There had been times since then where I thought I might be more comfortable with my body with breasts and a vagina.

I'm not always this way, though. Often times, I look down to see my genitals and just see it as my genitals. It doesn't always look wrong, but there are times where I wish it were something else.

I'm sort of a skinny guy. Not necessarily androgynous in appearance, but somewhat in build. It mostly makes me look younger than I really am. After workouts, I feel less dysphoric, and look forward to building more muscle (until motivation fades).

When I first started having sex, it was the same way, though lately, it's been weird. Initially, I'd feel more manly because like, I'm dickin this girl and stuff. But then when I'd be single and masturbate, I'd remember what a their vaginas felt like and imagine that on myself. Lately (after a multi-year dry spell) , with the woman I'm sleeping with now, I had some difficulty orgasming. I'd done it regularly a couple times, but it wasn't frequent. Last time, though, I had what had probably been described as ""female"" orgasms. It was all the way throughout my body, it lasted longer, and while I was satisfied, I was still able to keep going.

This wasn't the first time having an orgasm like that. My last sexual partner managed to get me to do that too, a couple times. I struggled to orgasm with her because of condoms, but this girl I'm with now's infertile and clean (I believe her because it's the best smelling vag I've ever eaten out, which, granted, is not a lot).

I don't talk to anybody about this. I have a lot of religious friends and some very conservative family members. But you could probably tell by the pile of word vomit here.

*I don't think I want to transition though, because here's why*:
1. The discomfort I'll feel with my body has not made me suicidal or depressed.
2. I'm in America and our healthcare is stupid.
3. I'm jealous of lesbians' sex lives, but I'm not jealous of their difficulty finding partners or how often they have to deal with unwanted sexual advances from creepy dudes (I already get that as a dude).
4. I don't know if I'd ever feel complete as a female with our current technology. I could never get pregnant. I'd struggle with my voice and my bone structure and a bunch of other stuff that, as far as I can tell, are not easy if not impossible to change. Also, TG fiction has set the bar too high for me...
5. I've seen myself in those gender-change filters and am still don't feel like I look right through their female filters, I doubt I can do much better for myself.

For some reason, my brothers and I all watched all the way through it. I think there was a CSI episode on it too. I completely misunderstood it, and thought it was a way that, if I absolutely wanted to, I could get pregnant too (I remember a story about a man who transitioned, had kids, and then de-transitioned). It kinda stuck in my head as a sort of backup plan if I wanted to abandon everything in life and start anew.\n\nWhen I hit puberty, I masturbated like a girl. Like, I\'d ""tuck"" and then rub it like an over-the-pants handy and that\'s what got me off. It was around this time I discovered my autogynophelia. It was initially the fertility, but now it\'s just the shape of a woman in general. There had been times since then where I thought I might be more comfortable with my body with breasts and a vagina.\n\nI\'m not always this way, though. Often times, I look down to see my genitals and just see it as my genitals. It doesn\'t always look wrong, but there are times where I wish it were something else.\n\nI\'m sort of a skinny guy. Not necessarily androgynous in appearance, but somewhat in build. It mostly makes me look younger than I really am. After workouts, I feel less dysphoric, and look forward to building more muscle (until motivation fades).\n\nWhen I first started having sex, it was the same way, though lately, it\'s been weird. Initially, I\'d feel more manly because like, I\'m dickin this girl and stuff. But then when I\'d be single and masturbate, I\'d remember what a their vaginas felt like and imagine that on myself. Lately (after a multi-year dry spell) , with the woman I\'m sleeping with now, I had some difficulty orgasming. I\'d done it regularly a couple times, but it wasn\'t frequent. Last time, though, I had what had probably been described as ""female"" orgasms. It was all the way throughout my body, it lasted longer, and while I was satisfied, I was still able to keep going.\n\nThis wasn\'t the first time having an orgasm like that. My last sexual partner managed to get me to do that too, a couple times. I struggled to orgasm with her because of condoms, but this girl I\'m with now\'s infertile and clean (I believe her because it\'s the best smelling vag I\'ve ever eaten out, which, granted, is not a lot).\n\nI don\'t talk to anybody about this. I have a lot of religious friends and some very conservative family members. But you could probably tell by the pile of word vomit here.\n\n*I don\'t think I want to transition though, because here\'s why*:\n1. The discomfort I\'ll feel with my body has not made me suicidal or depressed.\n2. I\'m in America and our healthcare is stupid.\n3. I\'m jealous of lesbians\' sex lives, but I\'m not jealous of their difficulty finding partners or how often they have to deal with unwanted sexual advances from creepy dudes (I already get that as a dude).\n4. I don\'t know if I\'d ever feel complete as a female with our current technology. I could never get pregnant. I\'d struggle with my voice and my bone structure and a bunch of other stuff that, as far as I can tell, are not easy if not impossible to change. Also, TG fiction has set the bar too high for me...\n5. I\'ve seen myself in those gender-change filters and am still don\'t feel like I look right through their female filters, I doubt I can do much better for myself.\n\n*tl:dr* - Can\'t tell if I\'m trans or just let my kinks guide my physical comfort, but I\'m probably not gonna transition anyway...

Obviously trans people are sexualized and fetishized all the time, but I'm curious if some manifestations of sexualized cross-dressing might not be problematic or offensive?

I've been thinking of my answer and so far have come to the idea that, to varying degrees, it all is because it is dependent on a history steeped in gender essentialization and strict categorization, where the erotic interest comes to some extent from taboo of breaking that. I'm not fully convinced of that though.

I think there's some space for finding genderbending attractive, but as a mostly non-sexual person, I really can't speak on the sexual aspect.

&amp;#x200B;

Last night I worked up the nerve to spill the beans to my little sister. I was so nervous and I played it off as if I had a fun little secret.. then I just came out and said it. She squealed so loud and said ""OMG!! I love you! I have your back big brother.. or should I say sis?""

&amp;#x200B;

My jaw dropped and I started crying happy tears. Then for the rest of the night we talked about girls nights, shopping, and she helped me pick out clothes online. She also said she would go learn how to do better makeup so that she can teach me herself when I get home from deployment. If I lost everyone else in my life to my transitioning, but still had my sister by my side.. it will all be so worth it! Shes such an amazing young woman! :)

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for my rant.. im just so very happy! :D

P.S. Funny story.. I started wearing my panties under my uniform without wearing any male underwear. My worst fear was realized today, but it went better than I hoped!

For me, my journey started 8 years ago, when this was a sexual thing, pretending to be the girl and it really got me aroused. Fast forward to now, it's matured and I feel really feel dirty in the bad way and REALLY want to disconnect the sexual shit from it and it be my normal life.

However, I can't help but still get aroused from what I wear, and I guess being a transbian doesn't help either. I want to enjoy and just be normal with what I put on, but it's like I can't help but get turned on occasionally? For me, this feels really invalidating, and it really worries me and I feel so bad. 

I'm thinking of HRT at some point and I keep jokingly saying to myself 'oh I'll deactivate that shit when I get hormones' , but the reality of the idea is there, it's more inconvenient.

15yr old MtF here, 4mo hrt. I’ve been struggling with my identity for some time, maybe not as much as others, but to me it’s been a long ride. I have a difficult time calling myself a woman, even though most people I’ve asked say I pass fairly well. I have serious trouble with thoughts of never being a “real woman” and I think that has to do with internalized transphobia. I know I’ll never be cis, and it just hurts knowing that. I’ll always be “that trans girl” or “the shemale.” However, I consider myself VERY privileged when it comes to the age that I started hrt and being able to pass somewhat decently. The only thing that really throws people off is my voice, and my inflection. I try very hard to make my voice sound feminine but most of the time, I either get clocked instantly or the bass in my voice just slowly slips out while I’m talking. A lot of the time I’m just sitting there wishing I was comfortable with being a boy, or wishing I was born female. Unfortunately, dysphoria has also dictated my sexuality, I feel like I’m bi, but I only want to date men because dating women just makes me incredibly dysphoric. I’ve genuinely felt love for women but it was quickly shut down by my dysphoria. I genuinely would not wish gender dysphoria on my worst enemy, this is absolutely fucking awful. Cis people have no idea how lucky they are. However, I do think being trans has some positives, I would have never met so many great people had I not been trans. Also, a bit off-topic, but I produce music and make beats, and my emotions have leaked into a lot of my songs. And in most cases I believe have made those songs better. I mostly make lo-fi hip-hop, and most of the music in that genre is usually very gloomy/sad. Making this type of music helps me find an escape from the constant burden of dysphoria and really helps me express myself. However, (again) there are still those main points I mentioned earlier, which still affect me greatly, and I would really appreciate any advice that you all might have.

And I don't want to make this about porn or anything of the sort.

&amp;#x200B;

I am just really curious about one thing, and that is... well. After I starter on androcur, I just can't orgasm any more. I do understand how the production of ejaculate is HEAVILY reliant on testosterone, and I am glad to get ""evidence"" that something is working and going in the right way. My issue, however is mainly that... well, I do not have penis dysphoria. I have no intention of going through needless surgery to get rid of something I have no problem with.

However, the situation where I can neither get dry orgasms nor ejaculate more than a few droplets is quite stressful. Because it sort of requires me to relearn the way I think about sex, and I'm sure I'll be forced to think completely different about enjoyment. 

But before I just accept this as something I've had, but won't have anymore. I want to ask you people, is there ""a way""? Is ejaculating and orgasms a thing of the past, and there's no going back. Or are there actually some things to do? I'm sort of assuming the porn stars are getting shots of testo or something... and that's not going to be an option for me. It's not what I want. But I'm sort of clinging to straws here.

I joined this group for help in communicating with a student. Please be respectful and honest. 

I am an elementary PE teacher (among many other hats I wear and have worn, including teaching in high school and coaching) and I recently had the pleasure and honor of meeting a young boy (formerly girl- I suppose one would say) whom I feel an extremely strong connection to. His first day in class I was unaware of his situation and inadvertently used the incorrect pronoun when describing a scenario to the class. It almost instantaneously occurred to me that I may have made this faux pas. I inquired about the “girl” with a colleague and she happened to know his story because his family is friends of hers. He decided this past summer that he was a boy. I worried quite a bit that night that I had hurt him and intended to apologize the next day. 
In a glorious turn of events, this amazing young boy asked his teacher if he could come talk with me. I assumed it was about the pronoun, but it was the fact that some other boys refused to see him as a boy. He wanted to talk to me more than his teacher (who apologized after our talk for addressing him as a her), the counselor, or anyone else in the school. I gave the best advice I could and felt it was very helpful. He even hugged me after. I read George, a story about a fourth grader in a similar situation, and want to do all I can for this great kid. His home life is a bit tense at the moment and I’ve already talked to his family friend and my wife so if something goes wrong I want them to know I am willing to adopt him. I feel very close to him.

For those who have not read any of my other posts I will be working in China until FEB 2022. 

(1) The big thing this week is that I have the house to myself for 10 days. I am currently wearing Katie's clothes (They have been away in suitcases for about 4 months). HRT has for sure changed my body a little. I have a little hour glass figure going on. I have obvious breast growth so the clothes are fitting better and my butt is really nice. 

(2)  Tried to get my hair cut today and the women cut it too short, really hard to communicate sometimes. It isn't too bad but I was devastated. I was hoping for a bob style. down to my lips. instead it is to my nose. (this happened with my eyebrows too. Went to get them trimmed&lt; but don't know how to say in Chinese I want to be pretty without giving myself away LOL)

(3) I don't even know how to pronunce the word  dysphoria, (meaning I have never heard it said) I just always knew I was a girl. 10 weeks into HRT, I have been worrying about certain aspects of my face. My nose is long, I have no idea about my chin, jaw and brow ridge. Wish I could post a photo on here.

(4) Face is changing very slightly. I get glimpses of her in the mirror, some days more than others. I have been working 7 days a week since July 8TH and I do look really tired. 

(5) breasts grew really fast, no nipples but they are sore and painful to touch. 

(6) Feel like I am shrinking too, but no solid evidence yet. although my shoes are for sure feel a little big now. let's wait on this one.

(7) Laser hair removal starts in 2 weeks today. face and neck, can't get my breasts out in a Chinese hospital so I will do my chest with a home laser. This hospital does lots of stuff so I might get my nose made smaller. 

(8) This one is fantastic. I am a Manager of 15 people and since HRT I have actually become better at dealing with people. I don't mess about and tell people directly unlike before. I am actually a lot better with people skills fair and firm ....pre HRT I was too nice LOL

I stated having these thoughts shortly after I did ecstasy for the first time. I was afraid that this is all beacuse of the drug so I thought it would go away. Even thought later i found sonewhere that you cannot develop dysphoria from substances.
But I didnt actually want it to disappear. When i started looking into my past i found some signs that might show that I would want to be a girl.
Well after some research I accepted that I might be trans and was kinda happy that I might look like a girl in the future.
But I also feared that I am only talking myself into thinking that I'm trans and if I transitioned I would regret it.
Well at the end of august/beginning of september some of the dysphoria (while im not even sure if it was dysphoria) along with the euphoria from wearing skirts started to disappear.
And now I'm afraid that it might be gone completely.
I think that i should see someone who might help me but I dont know what should I tell them if im not sure myself.

Can anyone suggest toys similar to this? Maybe that feel better or are more comfortable to wear?

I was always close to him when he was younger and now I still want to be close. I am sorry if this is confusing. He decided to transition a few years ago. At that time I was going through a lot and really had not had the chance to spend any time with him. He has changed his name and I have reached out to show my love. 

I felt incredibly bad for her because she has not been treated the best and all I want is for her to be happy and loved. I was able to visit with her a few weeks ago and it made my heart so happy. It was great seeing her again. But more than anything the smile on her face just made me smile. I even commented that I was so happy to see how happy she is and smiling like that. She was surprised because I guess not many people say that. She does not have much or any support from family. 

So here are my questions. What can I do to reconnect to her and is it ok to compliment her on things, or does that make it awkward? I wanted to tell her how lovely her voice sounded and how great her hair looks long. But I was not sure if that would build her up or make it seem awkward? I also want to see if she wants to go shopping and have a girls day, kind of make her feel special. See if she wants to do makeup, or we can get clothes, or nails done, basically girly stuff she may not have a chance to do too often. But I don't know if that is too much and if it takes time to get to that point. I think it may be a slow but steady process for her and she is a bit shy. But I also want to help if she would like it also. 

Basically I want her to feel loved, accepted, and happy and support her on her new journey. So anything I can do to help with that would be great. Any advice, ideas or tips will be much appreciated. Things that I should avoid, topics, or things that would have been nice to hear, that y'all would have appreciated would be great to know.

497,2019-09-10 17:58:44,d2bhna,6,17,"Another update to my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/mtf/comments/cfrk2s

And since the mtf sub thought it was erotica... 

Its now been 3 months since my surgery and according to my doctor, i can finally have fun with my new vagina! On my booklet that they gave me to schedule my dilatations for the year and other post-op care information, it said : ""you will need lubrication for vaginal sex""

Ha!

As the day drew ever closer to the 3 month mark, so has the date at which i start going back to work. But even better, so has the date of my wife's birthday. And I have been teasing her for weeks about it. My wife is also trans, but has opted to keep her lovely apparatus intact seeing as she likes it the way it is and is not dysphoric about it as well.

But there is also the fact that prior to me, she was a gay guy and has never been with a woman before. I was going to be her first. Quite the shoes to fill but I was up to the challenge.

I woke up early, thinking I could get my first dilation of the day done ahead of time but something kept me from actually doing it. As I picked up my phone and started browsing Reddit (of course), some very exciting pictures came along in my feed which aroused my body to the point of no return.

I turned to my still sleeping wife and put my arms around her, and my hand in her hair. As I gently woke her up by massaging her hair, i took my other hand and started gently scratching her with my nails, all over her thigh and all the way to her nipple.

I sensed her shifting and grunting more and more as i wrapped her arm around me so I could get even closer to her. I nibbled her tit.

She loves that.

My hands start moving around more and she finally shifts on to her back, allowing me full access. I wrap one leg around hers and move my hand down some more. Our eyes finally meet.

""Good morning"" i said as i squeezed gently.

""hrmmmph.. 'rning"" as her eyes lit up slightly more.

I continued my morning greeting with more fervor until she could take no more and gasped for air.

""Is there coffee?"" she asked as i laid by her side.

""Not yet, I'll go make it... later"" as I grinned to her face. She grinned back.

She turns to her side and opens up the nightstand. Out comes the magic wand and i lay on my back. Despite my best effort, orgasms have been anything but easy for me since that faithful day in June. My wife bought the wand for herself (with attachment) but I wanted to try it out and see if I could get some amount of pleasure out of it.

As she turns towards me, she lays her head on my breast gently and puts the wand on my crotch.

I shutter as she turns it on. She then proceeds to move it around, but I am still too swollen for the wand to work on the surface. I put my hand on hers and start to guide her around as best I can, hoping for a sensation on my end. I eventually find the sensation to be pretty nice on its own and just enjoy the moment. At one point, I had enough.

it was time.

""I want you"" i blurbed out. I knew she understood me as the wand twitched as I said it. So I said It again. She then turns to me and looks at me with intrigue.

The wand is turned off and she nervously but mischievously scoots in front of me and as I spread my legs.

""Are you sure?""

I nodded.

she fumbles around my crotch area, unsure of herself but I can't blame her, I've basically got a personal flotation device instead of a decent woman's vulva.

She tries her best but suggests that i mount her instead. I obliged. We switch positions and ask her if she's ready to beleive me.

""Beleive what?"" she asks me inquisitely.

""That I was telling you the truth about how it feels to be inside a woman.""

She kisses me on the lips.

""Let's find out!""

Sadly, with little feeling around my new vagina, i struggle to put her apparatus inside of me... until I don't.

Her face lit up like I have never seen it before. She shares with me a look that resembles a mix of excitement and pain and a dozen other emotions.

I feel nothing, but I feel everything. I sense her excitement has she grabs my hips and starts to buck hers upward. If only for a moment until she collapses and covers her face in shame.

""What's wrong?""

""I'm so ashamed, i came so fast, you'd think that I bought that wand in order to help me last longer...""

I removed her hands from her face and look her straight in the eyes.

""It's your first time with a woman. And i did kinda worked you up a lot before. Plus, you think that i lasted long my first time??""

She put her hands back on her face, visibly distraught.

""This is a first for both of us. We'll both have to learn each other again.""

She nods, still with both her hands between us, and sighs.

I wiggle my butt on her crotch.

""Do you want try again?""

""I dunno, do you think so?"" she replies as I sense something hard once more.

I once again help her with the alignment but now, things are different. She's in control.

I raise myself up straight, she moans even more. I can feel her bucking more and more and her hand on my hips and waist.

She's really in control now.

So I let go.

For the first time in my life, I'm someone else's to do what they please.

it feels good to let go.

It feels good to have her in me, even if I don't feel anything. The knowledge that this is happening to me is euphoric.

Our eyes finally meet.\n\n""Good morning"" i said as i squeezed gently.\n\n""hrmmmph.. \'rning"" as her eyes lit up slightly more.\n\nI continued my morning greeting with more fervor until she could take no more and gasped for air.\n\n""Is there coffee?"" she asked as i laid by her side.\n\n""Not yet, I\'ll go make it... later"" as I grinned to her face. She grinned back.\n\nShe turns to her side and opens up the nightstand. Out comes the magic wand and i lay on my back. Despite my best effort, orgasms have been anything but easy for me since that faithful day in June. My wife bought the wand for herself (with attachment) but I wanted to try it out and see if I could get some amount of pleasure out of it.\n\nAs she turns towards me, she lays her head on my breast gently and puts the wand on my crotch.\n\nI shutter as she turns it on. She then proceeds to move it around, but I am still too swollen for the wand to work on the surface. I put my hand on hers and start to guide her around as best I can, hoping for a sensation on my end. I eventually find the sensation to be pretty nice on its own and just enjoy the moment. At one point, I had enough.\n\nit was time.\n\n""I want you"" i blurbed out. I knew she understood me as the wand twitched as I said it. So I said It again. She then turns to me and looks at me with intrigue.\n\nThe wand is turned off and she nervously but mischievously scoots in front of me and as I spread my legs.\n\n""Are you sure?""\n\nI nodded.\n\nshe fumbles around my crotch area, unsure of herself but I can\'t blame her, I\'ve basically got a personal flotation device instead of a decent woman\'s vulva.\n\nShe tries her best but suggests that i mount her instead. I obliged. We switch positions and ask her if she\'s ready to beleive me.\n\n""Beleive what?"" she asks me inquisitely.\n\n""That I was telling you the truth about how it feels to be inside a woman.""\n\nShe kisses me on the lips.\n\n""Let\'s find out!""\n\nSadly, with little feeling around my new vagina, i struggle to put her apparatus inside of me... until I don\'t.\n\nHer face lit up like I have never seen it before. She shares with me a look that resembles a mix of excitement and pain and a dozen other emotions.\n\nI feel nothing, but I feel everything. I sense her excitement has she grabs my hips and starts to buck hers upward. If only for a moment until she collapses and covers her face in shame.\n\n""What\'s wrong?""\n\n""I\'m so ashamed, i came so fast, you\'d think that I bought that wand in order to help me last longer...""\n\nI removed her hands from her face and look her straight in the eyes.\n\n""It\'s your first time with a woman. And i did kinda worked you up a lot before. Plus, you think that i lasted long my first time??""\n\nShe put her hands back on her face, visibly distraught.\n\n""This is a first for both of us. We\'ll both have to learn each other again.""\n\nShe nods, still with both her hands between us, and sighs.\n\nI wiggle my butt on her crotch.\n\n""Do you want try again?""\n\n""I dunno, do you think so?"" she replies as I sense something hard once more.\n\nI once again help her with the alignment but now, things are different. She\'s in control.\n\nI raise myself up straight, she moans even more. I can feel her bucking more and more and her hand on my hips and waist.\n\nShe\'s really in control now.\n\nSo I let go.\n\nFor the first time in my life, I\'m someone else\'s to do what they please.\n\nit feels good to let go.\n\nIt feels good to have her in me, even if I don\'t feel anything. The knowledge that this is happening to me is euphoric.\n\nThe end (or just the beginning? 😉)', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My first post-op experience', 'created': 1568163524.0}"

560,2019-09-12 01:01:35,d308id,3,19,"Hi! My name is Olivia and I'm a trans woman of color. Coming out was the hardest thing that i've ever done. My Mexican roots are so conservative and tied with Catholicism so my family didn't take it well. They shunned me out and I was on my own at 19. I struggled finding jobs/housing/school, it's genuinely been the toughest 4 years of my life. Today, I find myself happier; some days are tough but being able to live my truth out weighs any pain i've experienced over the years. I may not have the most support in my life, but i've learned to support myself. I've learned to love myself. Being on the other side, I wish I could tell my younger self that they will be okay. It was fucking terrifying, but now i'm able to be free. I'm able to be me.

I know there are so many other trans individuals who are going through similar situations. I was able to feel so confident and progress in my journey because of other people's stories. I want to be that person for someone else. I started a podcast that's all about my transition/topics that relate to transitioning. I really try to provide as much advice as I can because it's been such a tough journey for me and I know someone could benefit off the things I have to say. Please, if you're interested, check it out or maybe share it with a friend?! I'll leave the link [here](https://anchor.fm/girlish):

My name is Olivia and I'm a trans woman of color. Coming out was the hardest thing that i've ever done. My Mexican roots are so conservative and tied with Catholicism so my family didn't take it well. They shunned me out and I was on my own at 19. I struggled finding jobs/housing/school, it's genuinely been the toughest 4 years of my life. Today, I find myself happier; some days are tough but being able to live my truth out weighs any pain i've experienced over the years. I may not have the most support in my life, but i've learned to support myself. I've learned to love myself. Being on the other side, I wish I could tell my younger self that they will be okay. It was fucking terrifying, but now i'm able to be free. I'm able to be me.\n\nI know there are so many other trans individuals who are going through similar situations. I was able to feel so confident and progress in my journey because of other people's stories. I want to be that person for someone else. I started a podcast that's all about my transition/topics that relate to transitioning. I really try to provide as much advice as I can because it's been such a tough journey for me and I know someone could benefit off the things I have to say.

My (21F) younger sibling (19MTF - we've discussed pronouns already, he's not ready for she/her) came to me a few months ago and told me he was trans. I've done my best to be as supportive as possible. I have a few questions about being transgender, but don't want to ask him because I don't want to scare him away. I truly care about him and want him to feel good in his own skin. Please tell me if I sound like an asshole!!

1. It's already pretty established that traditional gender roles are going away. Girls can wear suits, boys can wear dresses, etc. What does it really mean to be trans then? I poked through this sub and found advice such as ""wear nail polish and makeup"", but those aren't really ""female"" things anymore. Is it because it helps you feel more traditionally female? Sorry if it sounds bigoted or asshole-y, I genuinely want to understand and could use a trans person's perspective.

2. Maybe this is more of a mental health issue, but my brother does not want to take part in any aspect of life without transitioning first, but also refuses to take the first step in transitioning. He doesn't have an ID, won't get a job, and won't go to school. In our area there aren't really options to get hormones or anything, but I've researched therapists and counselors for him and he won't initiate any kind of treatment. His reasoning is that our mother won't make him an appointment. We've discussed that he is the one who ultimately has to start and he is an adult, but he just won't do anything. As someone who has struggled with depression in the past, it really really hurts to watch him throw his life away over something as small as an M on his ID. What can I do that I haven't already tried?

3. Almost went to AITA for this one. Our mother's bathroom door has to stay closed because the dog gets in the trash. Today he left the door open and the dog tore up all of her used pads. Our mom is disabled and can't bend over or stand too long without getting out of breath, so I cleaned it up. My brother asked me why she has a trash can in her bathroom, and I said ""Um, women are a thing."" He just wasn't understanding that women menstruate. I thought about his desktop wallpaper of half-naked anime girls and all the female characters he likes because they're designed well, and for a second I doubted how he felt. How can you say you are a woman when you don't even understand that periods exist? If being a woman meant being a cute anime girl, anyone would choose to be a woman. I feel so incredibly terrible now of course, but were my thoughts that asshole-y in the first place? I could really just use someone to help me process and correct them I guess.

This is related because I haven't changed my body at all. I've tried before. I was able to get on hormones for a month. But it didn't really change anything before I was forced off.

Anyway, what I'm saying is that since my thoughts are back now, I'm thinking about how to approach this, if they stay. (Last time they were here for 3-4ish years.). I have two large hurdles:

1. My weight. I'm not fat or overweight. I'm a lil' chubby and just unfit. I just don't like it. (Plus I know sometimes people gain some weight from hormones, so I want to be prepared.) But I have many friends knowledgeable on the subject to help on that.

2. My body hair. As I am, I'm a *bear*. Nearly every part of me is covered in thick black hair. And I want it gone.

How do I approach this? Shaving takes too long and the upkeep would be ridiculous because of how fast it grows. And I really don't have money for laser or electrolysis, nor to go out and get waxed. (I waxed myself once for Halloween. Ended up being 3.5 jars of wax and 200 dollars)

I’m 15 ftm. My mom has always been super supportive of the LGBTQ+ community so I’m not particularly worried about being hurt or anything like that. 

The main reason I am hesitant to tell her is I have three younger brothers and no sisters. My mom made this deal with my dad before we were all born where she would get to name the girls and he would name the boys. Obviously she got the short end of the stick there, but she was always perfectly happy about it and loves to call me her “favorite daughter” as a joke. I am worried that it would hurt her feelings if I told her that I had decided I was actually a boy. 

Overall if I didn’t tell her I don’t think it would matter to things all that much. I don’t experience gender dysphoria about the pronouns I am called so my mom referring to me by she/her pronouns doesn’t bother me that much. I have a binder that I wear a lot but she hasn’t noticed it at all.

My name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

**If you are interested, please visit** [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. 

If you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M. Paz Galupo (she/her or they/them), at [pgalupo@towson.edu](mailto:pgalupo@towson.edu) 

**Transgender Research Informed Consent (TRICON) Disclosure Policy:**

**Objective:** The objective is to gain a better understanding of how gender expectations, gender dysphoria, and body satisfaction may or may not interact to impact levels of sexual satisfaction. The results of this study will help to inform clinicians who work with transgender and non-binary clients to improve their sexual satisfaction.

**Primary Investigator:** The co-PI’s are Louis Lindley (graduate student at Towson University) and Annalisa Anzani (Doctoral Student at University of Milano – Bicocca) who are being supervised by Dr. M. Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)

**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. 

**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.

**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.

**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English. 

**Compensation:** There is no cost to participant in the study nor are there any travel requirements. There is no compensation for participating in the study. 

**Accessing Results:** The result of this study will be published in a peer reviewed journal. While we cannot guarantee that the article will be open access, we will post an accessible link to Louis Lindley’s research gate once it is accepted and published.",trans,"Participants need for trans and non-binary affirming, sexual engagement study!",1568432413.0,"{'created_utc': 1568407213, 'id': 'd3v9lt', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ' \n\n![img](7uirtof39fm31)\n\nMy name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.\n\nWe are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities.

I have a student that recently identified himself to the staff (one on one) as trans. We are a very liberal, supportive school with like 99% of the staff being supportive of trans folks.

I’m obviously in full support of him, and one thing we do as teachers is print the school district policy on trans identification which tells the students their rights in regards to pronouns, bathroom use, etc.
My reason for posting though is to see if there is anything i May miss that maybe you experienced in middle school? What are some things that you wish your teachers would have done for you, or anything like that.
I’m a cismale gym teacher. We don’t have changing rooms or anything so that’s not an issue for us.  But if there’s anything you think i should or should not be doing, please let me know. I’d like to make his transition as comfortable as possible while he’s in my class.None of the games or activities i do in gym divide students up by gender or anything like that, i never have “boys vs girls” etc.

I shaved my head earlier this year, cut off all my long hair, and dress pretty masculine. All the time I get mistaken as a boy and I tell her that and her response is always “just wait til your hair grows out” her constant need for wanting me to be more feminine is causing damage to my mental health, depression and anxiety. Every day sometimes I fear just walking into places because of how I look. I know it makes my mom uncomfortable talking about it but I have no one else to talk to and I’m seeing a therapist on Monday to see what my options are. 

Some days I dream of being a man. But then remember my mom and the people who love me and it makes me stop and think of the relationships I could ruin because of it. Will I regret it? 

Also, all my life I have hated dresses, skirts, and girly clothing. I always used to play the man when hanging with friends and I have the deepest memory of a girl telling me in 5th grade “If you were a boy you would be so hot” and I’ve been constantly thinking about this and all the recent circumstances where people have referred me as a boy or transgender.

I talk to my mom about this tomorrow because she knows I want to tell her. This evening I broke down crying after she just asked me “what’s wrong?” I can’t keep this a secret any longer and I’m having a really hard time still trying to accept myself.

738,2019-09-15 02:03:52,d4egt4,0,2,"Hi Reddit,

I am FtM and I just turned 16. After reviewing my transcript with my counselor, I discovered that I am ahead on credits and can graduate this year! Yay! I've been really excited about college for a long time, mostly because I'm so excited to focus on studying what I really love, but also because I planned on being out in college. Right now, my situation at home isn't great. My father is very emotionally absent and doesn't seem to even know who I really am. He starts a fight or ignores me anytime I try to talk about my plans to graduate early, and my mom and I both think that he still sees me as an argumentative 4 y/o who gets into constant trouble, not a responsible 16 year old. I have tried multiple times to come out to my mom, who I have a much better relationship with, and every time as soon as I started talking, she told me that this wasn't something I could talk about and that I needed to be quiet. I know that if I try to come out to my father, he will think I am lying for attention, because he thinks the same thing every time I try to come to him about physical or mental issues. Both of my parents are baby boomers and still say the words gay and transgender with hushed voices like they're talking about someone who is dying. They have also spoken rudely about celebrities and distant family members who are LGBT. 

This brings me back to the college situation. Right now I am applying to Carthage College, University of Chicago, and possibly Cornell. I'm using the common app, and it asks your biological sex, then has a section where you can elaborate on gender identity. I originally wrote Transgender Male there, at the recommendation of some teachers I am out to. I deleted it, though, after my mom told me she wanted to come visit me often at college, such as on parents weekends, and after she offhandedly reminded me that her and my father were planning to pay my college tuition. My father is extremely strict, and has already said that he will not pay my tuition if I get any tattoos or piercings, and I know that if I come out and start to transition, he will stop paying. I also know that if I am out at college and am able to be in a male dorm/floor with a male roommate, my parents will notice when they move me in and come visit.

I don't know what to do, and I've been really worried about it. I will still be a minor my first year of college, and that means I have to abide by my parents' rules. I also know that staying in my high school will be really bad for me. I don't have any friends there and am having a lot of trouble socially. I also won't have any classes to take next year. I also know that if I go to college and stay in the closet, I'll be depressed and badly dysphoric, and I don't want that ruining this experience.

I'd like your guys's advice on what to do, and to hear what those of you in similar situations have done. Also if any of you are students at the colleges I've listed, I'd love to hear what it's like to be transgender there, especially for Carthage since I haven't find any information about their trans community other than that it exists.

I also know that if I am out at college and am able to be in a male dorm/floor with a male roommate, my parents will notice when they move me in and come visit.\n\nI don't know what to do, and I've been really worried about it. I will still be a minor my first year of college, and that means I have to abide by my parents' rules. I also know that staying in my high school will be really bad for me. I don't have any friends there and am having a lot of trouble socially. I also won't have any classes to take next year. I also know that if I go to college and stay in the closet, I'll be depressed and badly dysphoric, and I don't want that ruining this experience.\n\nI'd like your guys's advice on what to do, and to hear what those of you in similar situations have done. Also if any of you are students at the colleges I've listed, I'd love to hear what it's like to be transgender there, especially for Carthage since I haven't find any information about their trans community other than that it exists.\n\nThank you all so much!"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Advice needed for a soon-to-be trans college student', 'created': 1568538232.0}"

One stated that apparently science has proven that it is impossible for a trans woman person to be in love with a woman. I first came out of the closet when I was 17. I went back in when I was 20. Was having trouble finding work and wasnt having any luck with romantic prospects. I also feared for my future ambitions when I get out of college. Because the college campus may be accepting. But I have come to understand it as a fantasy land that is nothing like the real world. I did end up finding a job. And women have approached me more. But its kind of miserable bottling who I am up. I know that its for the greater good. And that I am far more likelier to succeed if I do. But still its not great. I always had the intention to come back out. When I had enough money to go through surgeries and to be passable. But  that aricle and the comments  just makes me even more afraid to transition by fear of being labelled as a predator. I mean I'm not. I don't fetishise lesbians. I just feel like that is who I am and I feel more of a romantic attraction towards women. Im not even that much into sex tbh.

I don't know if they give a place to stay, study etc. for students who's over 18. And Turkish government doesn't really care about LGBTQ people so I don't know but they may not have enough facilities.
Turkey is a conservative country and I don't know if I'll be really safe too. I'm in a rural area so I don't know about cities that much but I see women murders and hate crimes on TV everyday so it doesn't seem safe that much.
Are there any international associations which helps people like me? I mean, I'll be 18 in Dec but still I'm a 17 years old student who has threatened by their mother. I don't feel safe and I want to get out of this country. I need help. I looked at Trevor project but it seems like it only helps people in USA. I feel suicidal too.

Why do some people think ""being trans is cool""?

First off, this isn't a post to hook up, I realize this subreddit isn't for that, and that is not why I'm posting this. Please read through before judging or assuming, and mods, please don't delete,or if you do, please direct me to some place I could talk about my issues.

So, I've been with my fiance for near 5 years now (im 27 now, she's nearing 26 October) and.. we are good on a lot of aspects but there are some that bug me a lot and over time is driving me away to other avenues. Some being maturity  (on her part, I know I'm not perfect either) another big thing is sexual.

I'm very active in that regard, but not asking to do crazy things but she.. doesn't generally want it a lot. And when we do, it's the same. No foreplay, no oral etc. Never a random hj or something, anything sexual is always only insert into hole till finished (lol).

  I have tried talking to about these things many times over the years and it ends up just her saying she doesn't like it, not comfortable (some kinks I get, but be willing to experiment? I'm not asking anything crazy. I'd do anything for her just to make her happy), doesn't like the taste (oral) etc.. yet she likes oral on her (but she doesn't force or even ask me to do it since, she won't kiss until I wash my mouth out for example).




Why am I posting this here you may ask? Well.. I've been getting fed up and despite other aspects of us going well, it's making it harder to not get 'distracted'-_- if you catch my drift.

This.. is leading me to want to find someone else and I feel like shit thinking this way. I've been cheated on, a lot, and she's the first that hasn't for background plot..

I'm a normal male, no I don't plan or think about transitioning, I'm comfortable being me. But.. I'm extremely attracted to trans. (MtF-that.. well look very feminine. I guess that's after hrt? I am oblivious to terms so excuse me on this), and.. oddly enough when I think about my future, I see myself with a person like that. Not with my current partner.  

When and.. if we break about.. how would I even go about finding someone? I'm not very social but I'm not awkward. I do have a hard time talking to people at first though - I take a while to open up. So I don't exactly go to places and talk much..

Again, please do not take this the wrong way. It's asking for advice on my situation and also a question. 


I don't get why my ideal dreams of me growing old is with a trans, but it is what it is. Is it an aftereffect of the issues of my current relation and my mind focusing heavily on lust? Possibly. But the thought of finding someone and making them feel special, holding them close and just living a hapy life together makes me happy.. just imagining  it.

I've been getting fed up and despite other aspects of us going well, it's making it harder to not get 'distracted'-_- if you catch my drift.\n\nThis.. is leading me to want to find someone else and I feel like shit thinking this way. I've been cheated on, a lot, and she's the first that hasn't for background plot..\n\nI'm a normal male, no I don't plan or think about transitioning, I'm comfortable being me. But.. I'm extremely attracted to trans. (MtF-that.. well look very feminine. I guess that's after hrt? I am oblivious to terms so excuse me on this), and.. oddly enough when I think about my future, I see myself with a person like that. Not with my current partner.  \n\nWhen and.. if we break about.. how would I even go about finding someone? I'm not very social but I'm not awkward. I do have a hard time talking to people at first though - I take a while to open up. So I don't exactly go to places and talk much..\n\nAgain, please do not take this the wrong way. It's asking for advice on my situation and also a question. \n\n\nI don't get why my ideal dreams of me growing old is with a trans, but it is what it is. Is it an aftereffect of the issues of my current relation and my mind focusing heavily on lust? Possibly. But the thought of finding someone and making them feel special, holding them close and just living a hapy life together makes me happy.. just imagining  it.\n\n\nLook forward to hopefully talking to you all about my dilemma!"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""(Nsfw) In need of some.. help/advice.

I think it’s been in my subconscious for a lot of my life, because I’ve always felt this slight unease every time I saw my reflection, or when I went to the bathroom, or just general day to day actions. I think online roleplay helped me realize something was going on, because for some strange reason, I only felt comfortable as female roles. The few times I was male in roleplay, I was not comfortable with it. Thoughts started conjuring up in my head occasionally, like “why do I want to be girl characters all the time?” I even thought about scenarios about how “things would’ve been better if I were born a female.” It occurred to me I wanted to be them in reality, but I only figured out the true depth of my issue when my closest online friend said that I always did come off as “feminine,” and he assumed I was actually a girl until I stated otherwise. 

That’s when it hit me. I **wanted** to be a girl... I don’t think I’ve ever had a more shocking revelation in just about my entire life, but it felt like something in me was awoken, and it was by no means a bad moment. With this turning point also came an impending wave of absolute doubt. I started looking it up, and looked at the symptoms of gender dysphoria. I know I’ve always felt a little uncomfortable being male, but my childhood seemed totally normal, in fact pretty typical for a boy. I got all the nerf guns, rocked all the monster movies, and played baseball up until middle school! But... I began to suspect my “feminine self” is hidden under a highly deep wall of insecurities which is why I seemed so “normal” in the first place. I’ve always felt just a bit different, enough to set me at unease. Yet, somehow? I’m still ashamed of myself. Many discouraging thoughts run through my head daily.. “You aren’t feminine enough.” “Your parents wouldn’t understand.” “You’re just being selfish, with your desires.” “Are you even dysphoric? Or are you making yourself believe you are?” It crushed my confidence, for a while, and I refused to admit it to anyone until recently. I’ve been gaining *at least ENOUGH* confidence, and I’ve admitted I wanted to be a female to a couple friends in marching band now. All of them are accepting about it, and it felt like a big relief! But... I feel uncertain I’m in the right direction. As if there’s this ominous abominable wall stopping me, a block, a preventative thought. And well... That thought, is that I’m just wrong. Wrong that I think this way, wrong that I may not be the handsome man my parents want me to be, wrong that I have been willing to go this far.

I've always felt a bit different since I was younger. I'm a female, but ever since I was little I always wanted to be a boy. I always cut my hair short, I dressed like a boy, I would even try to pee standing up on a stool (this didn't go very well lol). I was always refered to as a Tom boy. I wanted to be just like my dad. I would even go shirtless as a kid before I grew breasts.

Once I got older I started to grow out of it. I grew my hair out and started to act more feminine. I've never really thought anything of it.

As an adult, once I became sexually active I soon discovered this fetish of watching guys pee. I love everything about it. It's a huge turn on and I find myself obsessing about it. 

I myself have always been so envious of men. I've fantasized about having a penis, peeing standing up, masturbating as a man. 

Fast forward to now. I've been married 8 years, I have two beautiful children. I love my husband so much. Sometimes I feel like I almost have this obsession with his penis. I love to watch him pee (especially in urinals). I always just want to hold, look, or just play with his penis . I don't think this is normal behaviour. I don't know.

I also bought this device that allows woman to stand up to pee (gogirl) and I will try and go into the locked bathrooms sometimes (the ones with both a toilet and urinal) and I'll use the gogirl to pee standing up in the urinal. I find this really exciting.

One of the reasons I'm posting this is because yesterday I came across this post on reddit talking about trans woman who take testosterone and their clit increases in size almost like a small penis. This was so cool and interesting to me.

I guess in summary I am just very confused and could really use some advise from people. How did you know you were trans?

I do like being a woman, I'm happy with my life and my family. I can't even imagine telling anyone how I feel. I'm terrified what they would think. But I can't help feeling this emptiness like something is missing...

my question is pretty simple! I've been taking finasteride for about a year now and seen incredible hair growth results, and have been using minoxidil for about two years. Now that I'm on HRT and Minoxidil, I was wondering if I would stop seeing the benefits or Rogaine if I stopped using it at this point. I think most of the hair regrowth I got from was from Finasteride, so I figure that stopping wouldn't be an issue. Both my doctor's said it was up to me, I'm very scared though at this point becuase my hair is finally at a place where I am comfortable wearing it without a wig and would rather not go back to that place in my life.

I was born female and I'm a girl in the eyes of my closest friends and my loving family. It drives me crazy and I've always wished I was born as a guy, I wish my parents called me their son, I wish my brother called me his big bro, I wish my friends called be by my prefered name. I'm still in a big denial when it comes to me being trans, but when I'm looking at it rationally, all pieces fall together. I plan to talk to my psychiatrist about coming out as trans, after that I'll tell my friends and one day I'll tell my family. But I come from a really lgbt-phobic country, so it might take a while. 

I met this girl online. I feel like we've been knowing each other since forever, we talk every day, we play minecraft together and we cry on voice chat because of cute cats. She was the first person I've ever told that I think I might be trans, she's so supportive of me. If it wasn't for her, I'd still deny all my feelings, I'd still try to be a ""normal girl"".  She's just so sweet and great and I care about her so much. I can't believe someone like her cares about me too and tells me she loves me. This is the best feeling and I'm so happy I'm not alone in my trans journey. Even if everyone calls me a girl the whole time, she calls me a guy once and my heart gets overwhelmed by joy

I'm not sure why I made this post. I'm just really happy, but also worried about accepting being trans. It makes me anxious but it feels just right.

973,2019-09-19 11:45:42,d6cujr,1,1,"Hi! Some context: I'm living in Staten Island (after a few years in Brooklyn), recently out with everyone socially, using my mother's recently-vacated apartment for the month, and moving to Los Angeles on September 30.

I had been scheduled to go into Manhattan today to have the gender marker on my passport updated.  :)

But, due to this upcoming move, I'm finding myself reconsidering. I know many trans people have had difficulty with this process over the last year, with minor (or nonexistent) procedural errors being cited as justification.

If my address is changing, across the whole country, in the middle of the approval process...that feels like more than enough excuse for some bigoted State Department official who wants to give a trans applicant a hard time, right?

But then, I have a separate concern about waiting until LA (besides my impatience), which is the October 8 oral arguments before the Supreme Court re: queer folks' employment rights. 

I'm worried about my passport being in-process while this happens (I've heard the process takes 2 weeks, best-case), either because the right-leaning Court could make some farther-reaching scary determination regarding trans rights , or just because transness being in-the-news might empower some bureaucratic bigot to block me up.

I'm probably overthinking this -- and I'm realizing now that SCOTUS decisions don't happen \*right\* after oral arguments, though I'm unclear on how long that wait usually is -- but, of course, I'm worried about the possibility, however remote, of winding up without a passport. For unfortunately-obvious reasons, I place a high priority on maintaining the option to leave this country.

So, basically, I'm wondering which of my remote fears sounds less-remote. If anyone can offer any clarity or perspective on this, that'd be great.

1038,2019-09-20 14:57:36,d6w3mh,0,11,"There's a trans YouTuber I discovereda few months ago because she did some nice reviews of anime and manga (some rather obscure or old) with trans characters.

Unfortunately, she hit on some hard times and lost internet access (and possibly a place to live, from context). 😞 Although she only has a couple hundred subscribers, I suspect it has been a source of catharsis to be able to post these reviews and other videos, so losing that (possibly on top of living place stability) must have been very hard.

I've been very concerned for her. She has been extremely self-deprecating in text posts in the past. I invited her to join us here on trans Reddit, hoping it would be a supportive environment, but she didn't respond to the invitation. She seems extremely depressed.

Here's the worst of it, though:

Recently I decided to check out her Twitter, and 3 days ago she made two posts saying she was going to commit suicide one way or another. 😰 Worse yet, no one responded (until I did today).

I'm not sure how it works, but she seems to have had direct messages disabled on both Twitter and YouTube.

I could really use some reinforcements here for a trans sister. She's a really nice person and needs to know that she has value, something that many people have apparently been denying. Here are her YouTube channel and Twitter page:

I have been experiencing dysphoria now, but am very worried that it actually isn't gender, rather body and I don't want to make a mockery out of the community, by assuming I'm something that I'm not.

* Refusing to let down my hair from a pony tale for months at a time because I didn't want to basically know of its existence. It would get into one big matt and my family would have to chop off a few inches (I can't remember my exact opinion on it being chopped off?) My family has always told me it was pure laziness, but I can't remember that being an issue ever, I just didn't want to acknowledge it was there?
* Again with the hair, when I was say 13 (almost three years ago, so I consider it before I was aware of transgender being a thing), I would sometimes go into the bathroom and cry/ rip at my hair, I would get this overwhelming urge to just rip it all out so it would all be gone. I would be literally hyperventilating and pulling at my hair, all I could think about was getting rid of it. 
* When I was say 8, I would stuff socks down my trousers to make it seem like there was something there
* Only wearing unisex clothes from around 8 onward (basically boys clothing, because my mother could never find any unisex, but she told me they were unisex because I think that's what she assumed I wanted) till around 12? I detested anything with traditional girly things, but not because I actually hated sparkles or glitter, but because it was associated with being a girl. I also hated dresses, but don't remember quite when that started, probably puberty onward, after a while, it felt like I was playing dress up for a play or something. I would sit there, and remember I had a skirt on, then get this rush of cold (don't know how to describe it), and it would feel (when I looked down) like it wasn't my body that I was in. 
* Only wanting to play male characters in the big school play at the end of year 6 (10/11 years old for Americans), I applied for two male roles and was granted one of them. I didn't even conciser being one of the female roles, it was as soon as they announced the characters that I decided I was going to be a male. I was given a drawn on beard and did A DAMN GOOD JOB. The only other gender cross was written into the play for comedy, it was an over the top gender switch, that way made obvious with a beard and dress.
* Now this is a weird one, about perception of men, I didn't think that I would ever be able to grown up to be old and have a certain personality. It doesn't make sense writing down, it was like I decided, I've got a woman body, I have to be this woman person. It wasn't that I thought people couldn't be who they wanted. It was personal.
* I didn't think I would ever get my period. I was entirely convinced that I was infertile. I thought that I would never ever start and there was no way I would ever be able to have babies. There wasn't anything physically that showed signs of me not being fertile, nor anything that would make it so. I just knew, in my heart, I couldn't have a baby (which physically I could)
* For a while I was convinced there was something medically wrong with me, I literally checked my files, because I was so sure that my parents weren't telling me something and there was something wrong with me. 

Oh god, there's so much when I think about it. I don't know if I was just a clinically insane child or if these are signs.

So, I have a topic that I think is gonna get a lot of hate. I hope I am proved wrong. But, I am going to add a little disclaimer here. 

*This is not meant to target or offend anybody. This post was made in good faith in hopes to address a problem I have seen in the trans community. Everyone is their own person and this does not imply that all trans people are easily offended but rather that a sizeable portion of our community may be easily offended by content not meant to offend. To clarify even further, while it's fine for us to be offended by something the concern I have is when we aggressively respond to someone who said or did something in good faith.*

  
**Do us trans peeps get offended easily?**

So, it's a stereotype that trans people get offended easily. Now, if it were just a stereotype alone I wouldn't care but I've repeatedly found significant evidence of this in my experiences. Exhibit A is my local LGBTQ Outreach Center Facebook Group. I've seen trans people go absolutely off on other trans people for a difference in opinion. This caused and continues to cause many trans people seeking help to leave the LGBTQ community due to this toxic behavior. 

I'm not talking about posts meant to offend. I am talking about posts made in good faith. All it takes is one person to be triggered and then there is a storm in the comments. I've seen people's status as transgender questioned, I've seen people told insultingly to ""stay in the closet,"" I've seen a lot of toxic behavior from how some trans people treat other trans people over differences in opinion. These arguments are typically political. Now, there are many politicians that want to dehumanize trans people, minorities, just bad politicians overall. I think some of us, if we see someone with conservative views for example, automatically assign all the worst qualities of conservatives to that person without taking into account that they're a human with a complex belief system and most of the time they're not a stereotype.

I heard somewhere that one trans person said that just because they were trans they got the reputation of being the ""easily offended"" person in their friend group and that really sucks. We as trans people are a persecuted group around the world. We have many different things to be offended about like transphobes trying to invalidate us. But, possibly because of this persecution and the fact we're on the butt end of many transphobic comments and jokes that we are more likely to be offended at something. But, I find that often we're offended over dumb stuff. I made a post a little bit ago that was a basic trans validation meme but the meme format had Pewdiepie in it (the one where he is pointing to a screen or a board or something). That got a little backlash because I posted a ""fascist"" on a trans meme. While I didn't do too much research into this, I asked in the comments why Pewdie is considered a fascist. Nobody gave me a good reason. Most people pointed out the iron cross on his collar. Which, depresses me because this alone shows one of the reasons they hate Pewdie and regard him as a ""fascist"" is based out of ignorance.

The iron cross is a common symbol in today's society and doesn't have racial implications. However, the implication they perceive dates back to Nazi Germany where the iron cross was a symbol of the Wehrmacht (I'm a bit of a history nerd). Which... doesn't make him a fascist. The Iron Cross is still used as a symbol of Germany's army today, which proves that there were no hateful implications seeing how Germany did a total wipe of Nazism and now makes the display of the nazi flag and presumably other Nazi-related symbols illegal in Germany. I've seen beautiful photos of Germans being arrested for doing the Nazi salute. You could also make the argument about that incident regarding the Fiverr incident where he got someone to write on a sign ""death to all Jews"" or something similar. While this wasn't tasteful at all and people can make the argument that by even joking about something like that they're normalizing it, at the end of the day it was meant as a joke.

We cannot forget that people are human with flaws. We do not all share the same knowledge. We've taken many different paths in life and come up with different opinions and character traits. We're united together as all being trans. But, trans or not, we must remember that we're all human. I get it. If someone dehumanizes us and you dehumanize them... I am not blaming you. But, we cannot dehumanize people for simply having different opinions.

I'll touch on one more topic that I think might be a factor in this issue. **Validation.** As I said earlier, there are many who want to invalidate us as people. It's good to have some validation but remember, no matter what, science backs the existence of trans people. People who attempt to invalidate us are on the wrong side of scientific facts. Why am I mentioning this? Well, I feel like it *might* be a possibility that insecurity regarding validation and how the world sees us put some of us on the defensive and thus more easily to be offended by something.

I could be totally wrong with the reasons why I think this might be a problem. One thing is for certain though, you are human. I am human. We're all trying to get by on this Earth. We shouldn't waste minutes of our life feeling angry at something that wasn't intended to offend anybody. We shouldn't invalidate or fight with ourselves when we are having a hard enough time with transphobes and the such. I don't want to be treated any differently because I am trans. Being trans is not my personality. And, I definitely don't want my friends to think that they have to tiptoe around eggshells when they're around me. The ability to make fun of yourself a little is a good trait and puts people at ease. It's okay to be offended, but it's not okay to treat someone badly when they didn't intend any harm or offense. We should treasure logical and reasonable debate over Facebook arguments that take years off of our life.

I just don't know anymore. I'm pretty convinced I'd be happier as a woman but am I truly transgender? While I don't fit the stereotypical male mold I don't think that's the source of my discomfort.

# Hello all,

I recently had Facial Feminization Surgery (FFS) done on May 28th, 2019. I had the procedures done in Guadalajara, Mexico by Dr. Lazaro Cardenas and the [TransOp.com](https://Transop.com) team. The procedures I had done are:

* Hairline Lowered
* Type III Forehead Contour
* Brow Lift
* Rhinoplasty (Nose job)
* Upper Lip Lift
* Fat injections to Lips
* Chin Contour
* Jaw Contour
* Chin Implant
* Buccal Fat Pads Removal (Cheeks)

It has been 3.5 months since the surgery and I feel great. I had no complications whatsoever (thank god). Honestly, at this time, it is difficult to see any major changes in the face on what was done. As much as I may personally struggle to see the differences I must say that the dysphoria I had with looking in the mirror is all but gone. The biggest changes I noticed already are a slight puff to my lips, my nose is completely different and my brows are more shaped. I still struggle to see differences in cheek, jaw and chin areas but don't really have any complaints about it, though I may have wished the surgeon to be a bit more aggressive on the areas. There is, of course, still swelling in all the areas, particularly the nose, but I feel I can get a good understanding of what my face will look like down the coming months. All surgeons advise to wait and see a full year after surgery for the final results though so hopefully it will only get better :).

I will add more photos in the future detailing the differences of the side profile. 

# Why Mexico?

  
There were several reasons why I finally decided on going to Mexico for the surgery. The main reason was the price. Healthcare in Mexico is much cheaper than America and thus less expensive for cosmetic surgery. Several of the surgeons I really liked the work of and had consults with, including Dr. Spiegel in Boston, varied far too much from patient to patient. Part the reason I really liked transop was that they were transparent with the prices and everyone pays the same for the same procedures. I was quoted well over 30-50k+ USD for all the procedures listed by various surgeons in America that I had in person and skype consults with. In the end, I was quoted roughly 20k USD for transop and paid about 25k with tax, plane tickets and other various unexpected expenses (additional prescriptions, compression garments etc). 

Another reason was that Dr. Cardenas during the Skype consultation actually talked me out of some procedures which significantly reduced the price. It was a little reassuring to see that he wasn't just after the money and going to suggest a bunch of unnecessary things. Aside from chopping off several procedures entirely, he said he could get the same results I wanted while doing other, less invasive procedures or while doing another unrelated procedure. I mainly refer to the fact that my right eyelid/brow was slightly lower than my left. One of my biggest hangups when looking at myself in the mirror. One surgery told me I would need a procedure just for that. Cardenas was able to correct that simply during the brow lift by lifting the right side slightly higher than the left. This saved me about 2-3k that could have been wasted on. A simple fix for the thing that bothered me the most!

# The Facility

  
I have been to over 15 plastic surgeon offices and even had surgeries at different hospitals in America and can still, without a doubt, say that the Innovare Hospital that the surgery was done at was by far one of the most advanced, clean and modern medical facilities I have ever been to. I know Mexico tends to have a bad stigma when it may come to cleanliness or at least that is the general consensus it seems many Americans have about it. If you ever look to transop for surgery this is absolutely going to be no concern. 

# Dr. Cardenas and the TransOp Team

  
From my Skype consult to Surgery was about 1.3 years apart. I was pleasantly surprised again at how well Dr. Cardenas spoke English and had no trouble understanding or explaining what I wanted or needed. During our consult, he actually convinced me not to go for some procedures as he thought it wouldn't achieve what I wanted or that he could get the same look with something less expensive. Before the consult, I had a quote from the website for about 26k. After, it was down to 18k. I opted to go for an additional optional \[to me\] procedure when I got to Mexico which bumped it up to around 20k. 

The team themselves were very professional and friendly. All the doctors seemed to speak English, some better than others. The anesthesiologist was intent on making me laugh before putting me under (she succeeded). There were 4 doctors that I could tell performing the actual surgery. Dr. Cardenas' wife is an ENT. She did not perform the Rhinoplasty but her \[fellow?\] was in the surgery and I believe he did. He was the one who took care of all my post-op visits regarding the rhinoplasty aftercare. Before leaving my last appointment I met with his wife to get my nose checked out one last time. 

The only downsides I have experienced and heard from others is that he is not aggressive enough with Forehead Contours (not my main concern anyway) and Jaw/Chin contours. If you go be VERY CLEAR AND PRECISE with what you want it to look like and how aggressive he should be. Do not skip on the details with your one in-person consultation with your surgeon! I literally brought a picture of the nose I wanted. And that is exactly what I got and am extremely happy with the results. 

# The Recovery House

  
The recovery house is SUPER clean. There are two women here who cook and clean daily. The house would regularly smell faintly of cleaning products because they clean everything at least once a day sometimes twice. The beds are changed daily and laundry can be done if you choose to pay for it. They regularly left the windows and doors to the backyard open. It was late May - Early June and there was little to no bugs around. The temperature varied from 70-90 F but was not uncomfortable as the location is the high altitude and didn't have much humidity until I left around mid-June. It was still much more tolerable than where I currently live. 

Vincente runs the recovery house and is an absolutely amazing man. He will pick you up from the airport, drop off and pick you up from appointments, pick up prescriptions, and drop you off at the airport when you are leaving. He was sweet, funny, caring and spoke English very well. *He has two doggos - Lucas and Luci who are the sweetest doggos*. They honestly made the recovery that much easier as they regularly would come sit with me on the couch when I was resting in the common areas and let me pet them. 

***Food*** \- I am a very picky eater myself. The two women who work here don't speak any English but Vincente would often ask if there was anything particular I wanted to eat. They did their best to accommodate me. The morning would have some cereal, bread, donuts, and other pastries. The afternoon lunch/dinner would have just about any variety of food you could ask for. After surgery, I mostly ate soft bread, apple juice, ice pops, and pasta.

***Rooms*** \- When I asked how many rooms there were I believe he said he could have 7 people total staying there. There were 2 rooms with two single beds and another 2 with double beds. I didn't explore the entire house though so this could be a bit wrong. I went with my mom so we had the largest room that had 2 single beds, a TV and a loft area that didn't seem furnished at the time. It had a balcony and its own bathroom. I believe two of the rooms had their bathroom outside the room. There were no other girls staying at the house while I was there until my last couple of days. There was a German girl who came in in the middle of the night and had surgery shortly after. I was, unfortunately, unable to meet her since she was recovering and I didn't want to disturb her. 

# Pain

  
As someone who has fairly low pain tolerance, I must say that all the procedures I had very little pain. I would just describe it all as intense discomfort for the first few days. After the straws came out of my nose and they cleaned it up it was much easier in the coming days. Swelling reducing meds were far more effective than painkillers. I did have to ask for sleep pills though as the swelling/discomfort did keep me up at night and because my sleep schedule was all messed up.

&amp;#x200B;

# Final Tips

  
If you do plan to go keep in mind the following:

* Get your passport well in advance. Do not wait for the last minute.
* Try to avoid the Mexican airline if possible... I believe Delta or American Airlines fly out of Guadalajara and I am sure you will enjoy it more for the additional money. 
* They will only accept credit/debit. They regularly have to turn people away because they are unable to pay due to credit companies thinking it is a fraudulent charge or credit limits not high enough. Call your card companies before leaving. Sooner if you are leaving on a holiday weekend/time frame. 
* Use a card that has no foreign transaction fees if possible. Otherwise, account for the increased payment for the conversion USD to Peso. 
* Take into account a 4-5% tax to be added onto your totals. This is not accounted for in the quotes.
* I am not sure if this was intended to be included or an addon charge but I had to pay about $1200 for the hospital stay. This was a separate charge but I am not 100% sure if it was intended to be in the original quote since I added additional procedures after I got to Mexico. 
* Keep $500-700 cash on you for emergencies. I didn't see any place I needed to use cash but I can only imagine. I also tipped Vincente and the two women who worked at the recovery house. Some local shops accept USD but you can have it converted if you plan to look around the city. 
* Again, be extremely precise with your surgeon on what you want done and how aggressive you want it to be. Bring pictures (it couldn't hurt).
* Bring someone with you if you can - aside from the plane ticket, it is free to stay for them!
* If you are American - Register with the US Embassy's website for Guadalajara before you leave. 

&amp;#x200B;

# Final Thoughts

I do believe that I expected to see more aggressive results but I am not dissatisfied. I am content with what I got and paid for and do not have any regrets. Overall my dysphoria has gone done quite a bit. In the end, it is not for others but myself and as long as I am happy. :)   
I hope this may help anyone who may have been unsure of going to a foreign country for surgery or anything. I still am a firm believer in telling people that have consultations with many surgeons and pick who you feel the most confident in. Do your research. Dig deep enough and any surgeon is going to have some bad reviews. If surgery is on your mind it is up to you.

I hope this helps someone, even just one person :)

I opted to go for an additional optional \\[to me\\] procedure when I got to Mexico which bumped it up to around 20k. \n\nThe team themselves were very professional and friendly. All the doctors seemed to speak English, some better than others. The anesthesiologist was intent on making me laugh before putting me under (she succeeded). There were 4 doctors that I could tell performing the actual surgery. Dr. Cardenas' wife is an ENT. She did not perform the Rhinoplasty but her \\[fellow?\\] was in the surgery and I believe he did. He was the one who took care of all my post-op visits regarding the rhinoplasty aftercare. Before leaving my last appointment I met with his wife to get my nose checked out one last time. \n\nThe only downsides I have experienced and heard from others is that he is not aggressive enough with Forehead Contours (not my main concern anyway) and Jaw/Chin contours. If you go be VERY CLEAR AND PRECISE with what you want it to look like and how aggressive he should be. Do not skip on the details with your one in-person consultation with your surgeon! I literally brought a picture of the nose I wanted. And that is exactly what I got and am extremely happy with the results. \n\n# The Recovery House\n\n  \nThe recovery house is SUPER clean. There are two women here who cook and clean daily. The house would regularly smell faintly of cleaning products because they clean everything at least once a day sometimes twice. The beds are changed daily and laundry can be done if you choose to pay for it. They regularly left the windows and doors to the backyard open. It was late May - Early June and there was little to no bugs around. The temperature varied from 70-90 F but was not uncomfortable as the location is the high altitude and didn't have much humidity until I left around mid-June. It was still much more tolerable than where I currently live. \n\nVincente runs the recovery house and is an absolutely amazing man. He will pick you up from the airport, drop off and pick you up from appointments, pick up prescriptions, and drop you off at the airport when you are leaving. He was sweet, funny, caring and spoke English very well. *He has two doggos - Lucas and Luci who are the sweetest doggos*. They honestly made the recovery that much easier as they regularly would come sit with me on the couch when I was resting in the common areas and let me pet them. \n\n***Food*** \\- I am a very picky eater myself. The two women who work here don't speak any English but Vincente would often ask if there was anything particular I wanted to eat. They did their best to accommodate me. The morning would have some cereal, bread, donuts, and other pastries. The afternoon lunch/dinner would have just about any variety of food you could ask for. After surgery, I mostly ate soft bread, apple juice, ice pops, and pasta.\n\n***Rooms*** \\- When I asked how many rooms there were I believe he said he could have 7 people total staying there. There were 2 rooms with two single beds and another 2 with double beds. I didn't explore the entire house though so this could be a bit wrong. I went with my mom so we had the largest room that had 2 single beds, a TV and a loft area that didn't seem furnished at the time. It had a balcony and its own bathroom. I believe two of the rooms had their bathroom outside the room. There were no other girls staying at the house while I was there until my last couple of days. There was a German girl who came in in the middle of the night and had surgery shortly after. I was, unfortunately, unable to meet her since she was recovering and I didn't want to disturb her. \n\n# Pain\n\n  \nAs someone who has fairly low pain tolerance, I must say that all the procedures I had very little pain. I would just describe it all as intense discomfort for the first few days. After the straws came out of my nose and they cleaned it up it was much easier in the coming days. Swelling reducing meds were far more effective than painkillers. I did have to ask for sleep pills though as the swelling/discomfort did keep me up at night and because my sleep schedule was all messed up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Tips\n\n  \nIf you do plan to go keep in mind the following:\n\n* Get your passport well in advance. Do not wait for the last minute.\n* Try to avoid the Mexican airline if possible... I believe Delta or American Airlines fly out of Guadalajara and I am sure you will enjoy it more for the additional money. \n* They will only accept credit/debit. They regularly have to turn people away because they are unable to pay due to credit companies thinking it is a fraudulent charge or credit limits not high enough. Call your card companies before leaving. Sooner if you are leaving on a holiday weekend/time frame. \n* Use a card that has no foreign transaction fees if possible. Otherwise, account for the increased payment for the conversion USD to Peso. \n* Take into account a 4-5% tax to be added onto your totals. This is not accounted for in the quotes.\n* I am not sure if this was intended to be included or an addon charge but I had to pay about $1200 for the hospital stay. This was a separate charge but I am not 100% sure if it was intended to be in the original quote since I added additional procedures after I got to Mexico. \n* Keep $500-700 cash on you for emergencies. I didn't see any place I needed to use cash but I can only imagine. I also tipped Vincente and the two women who worked at the recovery house. Some local shops accept USD but you can have it converted if you plan to look around the city. \n* Again, be extremely precise with your surgeon on what you want done and how aggressive you want it to be. Bring pictures (it couldn't hurt).\n* Bring someone with you if you can - aside from the plane ticket, it is free to stay for them!\n* If you are American - Register with the US Embassy's website for Guadalajara before you leave. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nI do believe that I expected to see more aggressive results but I am not dissatisfied. I am content with what I got and paid for and do not have any regrets. Overall my dysphoria has gone done quite a bit. In the end, it is not for others but myself and as long as I am happy. :)   \nI hope this may help anyone who may have been unsure of going to a foreign country for surgery or anything. I still am a firm believer in telling people that have consultations with many surgeons and pick who you feel the most confident in. Do your research. Dig deep enough and any surgeon is going to have some bad reviews. If surgery is on your mind it is up to you.\n\nI hope this helps someone, even just one person :)\n\nTell me what you think! Do you see the differences in my face as well? Please feel free to message me or ask ANY questions :)"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'FFS Review Dr. Cardenas - Transop - Mexico - Before and After', 'created': 1569161337.0}"

I have been on HRT for about 6 months. I see some progress, but not much. Sometimes I look in the mirror and I love myself, while other times I look in the mirror and want to curl up and die.

The normal stuff.

So, is it normal to be so jealous of other trans women? I know that is a silly question. But for some reason, I can’t watch anything about trans women on Netflix, YouTube, ANYTHING without thinking about how well they pass, then looking at myself and feeling overwhelmed. “I could never do that...” I tell myself. I list off my flaws, my hairy chest, hairy legs, broad shoulders....
There is no way I could EVER be that pretty. I feel like there is some exclusive club that I missed out on, and now I have to be this manly looking woman forever, and I just can’t take it.

But I want to get over this. I just feel like this jealousy could be turned into something positive if I knew how to overcome it.

1188,2019-09-23 03:37:47,d814ao,2,7,"TW for ignorance and possible transphobia.

I'm sorry, I just have to vent about this.

I went home today and saw my parents and sister and visited with them for a while. I'm working on gathering the courage to come out to them at some point so that I can start on HRT. I'm 20 years old and my college provides free gender therapy and has a clinic that provides free hormones for HRT, so it isn't so much a matter of getting my parents' permission as it is knowing that eventually they'll find out one way or another and I'd rather they hear it from me before I start transitioning. They'll also need to know because I'd like to freeze some sperm to have kids down the road, but that's prohibitively expensive without financial help from my parents at the moment.

Now, my parents have never expressed any sentiments that would lead me to think they were transphobic, but they're certainly uneducated about gender theory and the like. My mom and sister have both made it clear multiple times when we've had casual conversations about gender stuff that they think being gender non-conforming is a choice that people make, and that people just ""decide"" they want to be another gender, and my dad is very anti-PC, so he's basically in the same boat.

I had a long debate with my dad today about gender stuff (we have friendly political debates pretty often, him being a libertarian and me being a liberal) pertaining to the recent addition of the singular ""they"" to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, partially because I wanted to sort of probe his reactions and see a bit more clearly how he might take it if his son came out to him as, well, a daughter. His arguments basically boiled down to non-conforming people wanting to make others live in their made-up reality in which they are some gender they weren't assigned at birth. From how I understood his argument he sees gender non-conformity as a delusion on the part of the non-conforming. 

Issues like these don't interest my mom and sister as much, but like I said, that's kind of resulted in them being pretty uneducated and thinking some pretty incorrect things. I will say that when I eventually come out to family it's going to be to my sister first, since she's been through her own alienating experiences with my parents in the past--namely, converting to a different religion, which my parents were none too pleased about--so hopefully she'll understand in a way that my parents can't. 

I guess the biggest wildcard in all of this is how my parents react when this is an issue that affects someone in their immediate family. I worry that I'll explain the situation to them and they'll brush it aside or dismiss it out of hand, a la ""we think this is just a phase"" or ""just decide to be a man again,"" like it's that easy. I definitely think the chances are slim that they'll pay for any sort of surgery, sperm banks, or HRT out of pocket, as they're pretty money-oriented people too. I'm just scared they won't accept me for who I am, or if they don't, then I'll be forced to either cut them out of my life or live as someone I'm not.

I\'m working on gathering the courage to come out to them at some point so that I can start on HRT. I\'m 20 years old and my college provides free gender therapy and has a clinic that provides free hormones for HRT, so it isn\'t so much a matter of getting my parents\' permission as it is knowing that eventually they\'ll find out one way or another and I\'d rather they hear it from me before I start transitioning. They\'ll also need to know because I\'d like to freeze some sperm to have kids down the road, but that\'s prohibitively expensive without financial help from my parents at the moment.\n\nNow, my parents have never expressed any sentiments that would lead me to think they were transphobic, but they\'re certainly uneducated about gender theory and the like. My mom and sister have both made it clear multiple times when we\'ve had casual conversations about gender stuff that they think being gender non-conforming is a choice that people make, and that people just ""decide"" they want to be another gender, and my dad is very anti-PC, so he\'s basically in the same boat.\n\nI had a long debate with my dad today about gender stuff (we have friendly political debates pretty often, him being a libertarian and me being a liberal) pertaining to the recent addition of the singular ""they"" to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, partially because I wanted to sort of probe his reactions and see a bit more clearly how he might take it if his son came out to him as, well, a daughter. His arguments basically boiled down to non-conforming people wanting to make others live in their made-up reality in which they are some gender they weren\'t assigned at birth. From how I understood his argument he sees gender non-conformity as a delusion on the part of the non-conforming. \n\nIssues like these don\'t interest my mom and sister as much, but like I said, that\'s kind of resulted in them being pretty uneducated and thinking some pretty incorrect things. I will say that when I eventually come out to family it\'s going to be to my sister first, since she\'s been through her own alienating experiences with my parents in the past--namely, converting to a different religion, which my parents were none too pleased about--so hopefully she\'ll understand in a way that my parents can\'t. \n\nI guess the biggest wildcard in all of this is how my parents react when this is an issue that affects someone in their immediate family. I worry that I\'ll explain the situation to them and they\'ll brush it aside or dismiss it out of hand, a la ""we think this is just a phase"" or ""just decide to be a man again,"" like it\'s that easy. I definitely think the chances are slim that they\'ll pay for any sort of surgery, sperm banks, or HRT out of pocket, as they\'re pretty money-oriented people too. I\'m just scared they won\'t accept me for who I am, or if they don\'t, then I\'ll be forced to either cut them out of my life or live as someone I\'m not. That last possibility scares me a lot, because my parents have always loved and cared for me, and that\'s the one bridge I\'m the most scared to burn in my process of coming out. \n\nAnyway, rant over.

Cw: eating disorders, self harm, dysphoria

When I started college (three years ago) I was struggling to figure out my sexuality, which is when I found out there was a difference between romantic and sexual attraction. I was very uneducated on everything LGBTQ related because I have a pretty conservative family and my mom can be slightly everything-phobic. So coming to college I only knew that I wasn't straight. I knew vaguely of trans people but I never understood it and as time went on, I got more and more fustrated at my lack of knowledge of everything. Right around that time, I fell into a pretty diverse friend group and really started understanding myself more in general. I added a second major, got an on campus job, found a new passion, and joined a great organization on campus. I was also getting more in touch with my spirituality and I was feeling great. About a year ago, I became really close to a few FTM people and one MTF person. They were all so open about their experiences and open to helping me educate myself which I am still doing and greatful for. This past summer one of my friends came out as nonbinary and I started researching it to make sure I could be as accepting as possible when I got back to school. That's when I started cracking, but in reality it was like someone threw my fragile egg self onto the floor.

I had always had issues with the way I looked, I remember looking in the mirror in elementary school and feeling gross. I developed an eating disorder relatively early on because I noticed my body changing and I hated it, but I didn't know why. I gained weight despite hardly eating anything, and slowly began to develop like every other ""female"" my age. I remember going shopping for my first ""big girl"" undergarments and feeling sick, my mom told me it was just that I had to adjust to being a girl and I'd be fine. As I got older, the disconnect I had when looking at or trying on any clothes became unbearable at times, especially when I needed bras. Even before I knew what being trans was, I knew I really hated my chest and wanted to have it ""fixed"". I never really felt ""girly"" or ""boyish"" but I just thought that was normal. It wasn't until I became friends with the trans people I'm friends with today that I even realized that people feel gender. I truly thought it was just I have this body part so I am therefore this gender, because I was so uneducated. My ed had gotten bad in the early parts of this year, after being in recovery for a while. Over the summer someone really close to me came out as nonbinary and I had no idea how to support them because I had never heard about it before. As I started looking into it more online, here, and in other places I quickly started identifying with a lot of the things that I was reading about. I started looking back at my life and realizing that x time I had experienced dysphoria, and x thing was because of this or that. 

As I mentioned before,  over the last few years especially I got significantly more in tune with my spirituality, and although I dont have a lable for it, the best way to describe it is that I'm a pagan but I also just believe that everything happens for a reason and the universe has a plan.  Ive been working on trusting that belief which is one major thing that got me out of some really dark times, while also allowing me to honor those. So when I started connecting times in my life to dysphoria or to being moments where something felt disconnected and wrong regarding who I was, I asked myself if I could possibly be nonbinary. The second I asked that,  and thought yeah that is a possibility it felt like a huge weight was lifted off of me. The days of compulsively thinking ""I need to be skinny"" and feeling like the only time I was mre was when I was hungry almost instantly just left and were replaced with ""this is me and I can take care of this"". I felt like i was whole, like this part of me was just missing and I needed to have that one thing and now I did, it was something to identify with that made sense to me. Before I thought that to myself, I thought I was broken since i didnt have the urge to do girly things all the time and since I hated my chest it had the ocasional what if I was born a guy moments (I know how the hell didn't I know sooner is beyond me but I blame it on the lack of education). 

I've come out to a few of my closer friends, and asked all my friends to call me by a shortened version of my name. I'm not sure if I'm going to change my name or anything, partially because I have a rare name and partially because comming out at home isn't possible (which I'm 100% okay with because it's for my safety and as much as it sucks I know as long as I honor who I truly am for myself thats enough for me to be happy). But with realizing this, and the fact that I went through a really depressive part of life I need the change so I can fully be happy with myself again. I also decided that I'm going to talk to my doctor about having a breast reduction surgery (it's something I've been concodering long before I knew I was nonbinary because I have an uneven chest and it also causes back pain so yay fun times... but I also dont completely hate having a chest.) The last two and a half months have been intresting and while it's not what I expected I've had amazing people surrounding me and it feels really good to know myself more than I ever have. Especially having so many of my friends, most of whom have no idea what I'm going through being so acomidating and accepting of the whole name thing has been amazing. I'm still working on pronouns since I've been feeling more disconnected from but they/them also doesent feel right (I've been looking and trying out shi/hir  since it isnt a large shift from she/her especially since i can't come out at home but we shall see...) 

To me being nonbinary is just being a human. It's more of a lack of feeling for me than a specific feeling. Like I don't and never have identified with masculinity or femininity,  but I know I'm not lacking gender and I don't feel like I move from gender to gender. I just kinda am, like a rock in the middle of a river or something. 

But ever since I started questioning and realizing this, I've just really apreciated everyone more. Were all just trying to figure ourselves out and whether were just starting or we've known for years, we all just want to live and be happy. So I hope that's what we can all do, if not now than someday. I was inspired to say all this because I've seen so many posts about people wondering if they're trans or nonbinary and questioning what it feels like and stuff. I know that this is my own experience but I also felt like it was something I needed to get off my chest. 

TL;DR: I realized I'm nonbinary really quick and were all amazing and I hope you realize that. This was basically inspired by the amount of am i trans or questions about being and feeling nonbinary but idk...

Several months ago, after a lot of thought, I came to the conclusion that I identify as non-binary. I identified as enby for a long time before I came out as a trans male and started taking hormones, but I think I felt a lot of societal pressure to really prove myself as ""male"" in order for the people around me to take me seriously and so I could get onto hrt faster and achieve the effects that I wanted my body to have, to feel more comfortable.
But as I've gotten more in touch with my non-binary identity, the things that I used to love about testosterone now cause me a considerable amount of dysphoria, namely the body/facial hair. I have a loooot of it and it grows so quickly that it gets hard to manage. 

Testosterone has been integral in helping my mental health and making me more comfy in my body and I don't believe I would ever want to completely stop taking it however I've been tossing up the idea of going onto a lower dose of testosterone but been wondering about a few things and I guess would appreciate some feedback and help. 

I've been curious about if going onto a lower dose would even do anything in terms of slowing hair growth? Am I just stuck with all of this hair? 
What other effects would it bring? Would it change my voice or anything else? 
I'm currently taking 130mg every two weeks subcutaneously

Additionally one big thing I've been nervous about is that if I do go on a lower dose, my period would return until I finally get a hysterectomy. 

I could probably deal with a period as it's happened before when I had a messed up dose switching from intramuscular to subq, but how would being on a lower dose affect my hormone levels if I do choose to have a hysterectomy? (I would likely be keeping one ovary so I would still be producing some estrogen)

Currently we’ve been planning on asking for trans, non-binary, and/or gender queer actors to audition for that role. At the same time it’s important for the play that the trans actor in question be male presenting. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time auditioning for a role that’s not right for them. 

I just want to make sure I’m both clear and tactful with the audition notice. 

Secondly, I know that casting trans characters (especially by cis actors) is an issue. What are your thoughts about opening up auditions for people who identify as non-binary/gender queer? Ideally we would cast with a male trans actor but given the age range and how we’re in a smaller acting market (not New York or LA) I worry about someone who both fits the demographics and also has the chops for a pretty demanding role.

1258,2019-09-24 09:08:43,d8kl5s,1,3,"So this may be a long one.

So first off, let me introduce myself. My name is Tyler and I'm FtM. I am 19 years old, 20 soon and have known that I've been trans for a very long time now. I have been in a straight relationship with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now. No one but my internet friends know about me being transgender.

I've been thinking about coming out for the past 2 months now.
I want to come out as soon as possible now, for the sake of my mental health which has been declining.

To start off, I live with my boyfriend and have for 2 years.
I'm not sure on his stance of transgender people. He's made jokes about them multiple times and I'm not sure if he's transphobic or not.

I want to come out to him first.

If he chooses to not continue our relationship, I'd understand but I'd have no where to go since I was recently fired and my parents live far away. 
So it's risky. But would improve my mental health either way. Sure the blow of losing a loved one will be incredibly hard for a while but in the long term we'd bother be happier...

And my parents? They're on really good terms with me. We never used to get along but since I moved out, our relationship had improved dramatically.

It's disgusting to see communities that are so hell bent on acceptance for all (mostly for their own creed, but that's a different argument) hate and slander us on things they don't understand. I can think about multiple examples of this, but the most prominent are ""trans lesbians ruining the lesbian community"" and ""trans men being proud men is an example of toxic masculinity."" these are equally abhorant statements in their own light 

The former hurts me more, however being a bisexual woman I may be bias. Ignoring the blatant ignorance presented in this argument, the worst part of it is that it shows that a shockingly large amount of the LGBTQ+ community can't respect the fact that trans people are their preferred genders. If there was a real belief that trans women are women, then this argument wouldn't exist. Consequently, it adds a hint of doubt to what we would otherwise see as ""accepting"" people, people who know our struggles as being hated for what you can't control. Though this opinion obviously isn't heald by all lesbians, and it would be hypothetical to say that it is, the loud minority can really damage the majority, and if can cause some people to have alot harder times finding groups of like minded people to feel confertable around.

The latter is bad in another way. It less shows a hate for trans people, but instead shows that there is an anti-male discrimination among the LGBTQ+ community. A community based around the unification of all people, regardless of race, creed, gender, or sexuality, will openly express a strong hatred and bias twords men.

1326,2019-09-25 19:40:27,d98eiv,4,9,"I'm going to start off by apologizing if this triggers anyone, and for writing what I'm sure will be a novel size post by the time I finish. But I guess it's just time to get it off my chest.

With that being said, let's dive in.

I'm 25, currently publicly identifying as a cis bisexual female, although I do have a handful of people who are aware that I've been questioning my gender over the last year. 

I started questioning my gender just over a year ago, prior to that I had never once even considered the fact that I was unhappy with my gender. I knew I liked girls, I knew I felt more comfortable hanging out with the boys, but I never really thought about *being* one. In fact, I wore make up and dressed rather feminine right up until I was 23. 

I remember when I was younger, having a fascination with the girls I spent time with, I loved watching them do cartwheels and get giddy over the cutest boys, I never really understood why though because I wasn't like them that way, I didn't really care how cute the boys were... I just wanted to catch snakes and salamanders, and play with worms and snails.. I definitely spent more time with the tomboys than I did with the girly girls... But all the same, I was in dance classes.. (although, I don't particularly remember *ENJOYING* them... I just really loved my instructor.)

I was never great at sports. I hated gym. I loved the spice girls (although, if I'm being honest, I think that had more to do with having a crush on them than it did with wanting to be like them.) I never hated wearing feminine clothes or anything, not that I remember anyways. I mean I remember my mother dressing me in this god awful velvet dress one Easter but I hated it because it was itchy and the sleeves were too tight... I didn't really care that it was a dress. I mean I wore a lot of track pants and t-shirts but that was more my parents decision than mine, I didn't care what I wore as long as I could be out playing.

Flash forward a few years, I remember always being sort of curious about other girls and wondering if they had the same... Um.. undercarriage?.. as what I did. It wasn't like this obsessive thing, it was just kind of a curiosity I guess. I couldn't understand why men could stand to pee, and could literally pee ANYWHERE... and I had to sit down, and sometime fall in, a toilet bowl just to pee. It didn't make sense. 

Another few years pass, at this point I've got a brother, my dad starts moulding him into a proper little boy, takes him in the Jeep, takes him fishing, tapping, wants to take him on his first hunting trip.... My brother hated all of it. He hates hunting, hates sports (unless it's wrestling) he just didn't want any part of it. Me on the other hand, I begged. I wanted to go be in the blind! I wanted my first deer, I wanted him to see that I could shoot just as good as any old boy and could do better! I got out in the blind once. Never seen a single deer. He never took me again. That's the first time I really remember feeling hurt that I was a girl, because being a girl meant dad didn't want me in the woods.

Life stayed pretty normal though, I started dating boys when I was 14.. my best friend wanted me to date her boyfriends twin brother, so I did, y'know, young... Niave.. lol.. it was the worst decision I had made, have made. He was my first brush with abuse. Physical, mental, emotional, sexual.. you name it. He broke me. But, I decided a lot of our issues stemmed from the fact that I... Was a lesbian. I started dating women when I was 16. 8 years later, I had stayed with women, 5 of the 8 being with one amazing woman.. and that brings us up to date.. or well.. almost.

My fiance and I split up in the summer of 2017. I was devastated, but decided it was a new lease on life for me to do whatever the hell I wanted and not have to worry about how it effected anyone in my life.. all of my decisions were run past her when we were together.. so for the first time in years, I had no one to run things by. It was just do, or don't do. 

I cut my hair and bough my first pair of men's jeans. I had always been jealous of the Butch style lesbians because they seemed like they had it so easy... It was minimal upkeep to almost always look amazing. They were always comfortable, and still managed to look good. So, I cut off my hair and started dressing more masculine, but it was strictly for comfort. 

What I didn't take into account was how I would feel the first time I got called ""young man"". My heart stopped, and then pounded so fast it was like a snare drum pressed against my ear. It came up into my throat, and then immediately, sank to the pit of my stomach. Excitement turned to dread in 3 seconds flat. Lesbians do *not* get excited over being misgendered. At best, they are indifferent towards it.. right?.. 

So I knew something was off. And started to question if maybe I was something other than cis. I mean, I've always envied a good beard, strong muscles.. I've envied a man for his body more times than I can count but not to the extent that I felt discomfort in my own.. until.. I started questioning. Then it hit me like a sack of bricks. Dysphoria went from 0-100 real quick. And then it's like I slammed the brakes. I couldn't be trans. I can't be trans. I'm not trans. Because being trans, means coming out.. again. Only this time, it's not who I love but who I am. This time, it's not my sexuality, it's my identity. It's who the world has known me as for 25 years, gone. My family would never accept that. I mean, I can barely consider accepting it myself... I know them.. they wouldn't be able to handle that.

Next thing you know I'm wearing make up, over sexualizing myself, and for the first time in a decade... I threw myself at men. I needed to know that men found me sexually and physically attractive EVEN if I had short hair. I went off on a bender... Craving the affection and affirmation of men that I was a good enough woman.. that I was exemplary even. 

And now.. now I have no idea who I am, or what I'm doing, where I'm going.. all I know is I'm lost, I'm in pain, and I feel like I don't fit. No matter where I turn, no matter what I do.. I just, don't fit.

If you've made it this far and haven't given up on my tirade at this point, thank you. Thank you for listening to me throw a fit. Thank you for giving me the time to just get it out. I appreciate it. 

I don't really know what I'm looking to get out of posting this... I guess I just needed to get it out. Let my chest be a little less heavy for a moment.

X always loved playing female characters, role playing as a girl, other stuff like that. But being a kid, I just took it as love of the characters and such.

X struggled with depression and other things from 2013-now, and I think the online community was there for them.

I'm 21, and I thought I have been genderfluid. I identified as a man for more than two years and I was even on testosterone for maybe for maybe two years on and off. 

Last year, about to be be two years now. I was sexually assaulted at a mental health facility by a nurse. I am not going into details because I can't re traumatized myself, I hope that's okay. She r**** me while telling me to be a cute girl again over and over while doing, yeah... When I left the facility I told everyone that I wasn't a guy anymore, got off T and just suffered.. 

I got back on to T for six months after one point but I just started remembering the incident and it hurt too much so I got off again. I hated it. I want to be on it so bad, I was happy when I got things like a little amount of facial hair and a deep voice. 

I was so conflicted I told everyone I was genderfluid because of how much I was flip flopping. I do like wearing dresses but it feels like cross dressing or cosplay to me. It isn't necessarily me but I like to dress up and just, I really really hope people understand. I am not saying dresses aren't for women but I am saying how I feel when they are on me. I see my best friend who is a trans man in dresses and skirts and I just, I want that for myself too. 

Hell, even when I got a hysterectomy for an unrelated medical issue a few months ago I was so happy. Even though I didn't have cycles in the first place it still felt amazing. I even tell everyone how I'm still going to get a double mastectomy because how I hate my chest. I wear my binder to seem masculine and I want to wear it all them time. 

I am rambling, but my point is that.. this absolutely scares me. I don't know what to do. I am not a place in my life where I can tell my family where I am a guy for sure. I am scared to tell my therapist tomorrow! If I even can!!

I told my girlfriend and best friend after I move out I'm getting a name change without telling my parents or family knowing at the same time as my girlfriend. I want to get my gender marker changed too because that F kills me and even the thought of an X kills me. 

What am I going to do, how am I supposed to tell everyone, how do I explain please I don't know what to do and I'm just scared. I hate that trauma has messed with me so bad that I can't get this figured out anymore. How do I even tell my girlfriend? I don't know what to do if she reads this before anyone else does..

At the very least he's gender non-conforming but feels worried about expressing it. Being a trans person myself, I pretty much know gender euphoria when I see it (and I believe I've seen it in him). Also he's told me how much he wants to wear feminine clothing and ""look pretty"", and seems to have a strong desire to be ""mistaken"" for a woman by the people around him.

There are a lot more details contributing to my belief that he might be trans - basically many different experiences that have all added up over time. I would prefer not to describe everything excessively though since it would take all day, but just know that I have thought about this in great depth, and this issue has been ongoing for a long time.

It seems like my partner personally doesn't believe he's trans because he doesn't have full on body dysphoria. In my experience he does seem incredibly uncomfortable with his body hair, and tries extremely hard to hide it whenever he does dress femininely. Regardless of whether that's dysphoria though, I am a believer in the premise that people can be trans without dysphoria, and also that social dysphoria and gender euphoria are real things.

Mostly my struggle right now is that I want to encourage him to be himself, but not push the issue and cause him to retreat more into his shell. Mostly that ends up with us not talking about it at all, though, and I feel like I'm not doing enough. On top of that, I've been dealing with this uncertainty about him for about three years now, and selfishly I kind of want to just KNOW so I can react according to reality and not just speculation.

Does anyone have advice about what I should do? I try my best to make him feel loved in general, but should I be doing more? To use an analogy, I know that when it comes to baby birds hatching, you shouldn't force their shells open, you just have to wait. But the current uncertainty and not addressing the ""elephant in the room"" just... kind of sucks.

So I came out as trans about 4 years ago, and since then have been binding, packing and have kept my hair in a male style (I go to a barbers so it looks more manly), but I don't know if I'm actually ftm or not. I recently moved from a small island called Jersey in the English Channel to the UK, and started going to an all boys school that started going coed last year, and I'm in stealth there. I like hearing myself being referred to as a guy, with he/him pronouns and my sister calling me her brother and all that, but the main thing that bugs me is my name. 

I chose the name my parents would have given me if I was born male, but I don't know if it fits me. I know I don't like my dead name, wether being referred to by it or just generally hearing it (which is difficult coz it's a very common girl's name), but I don't know wether I feel 100% happy with my current name. I like wearing some femanine clothing like skirts over jeans or this shirt I got which is sheer but covered with velvet flowers, and I like my hair a little on the longer side even though the fringe doesn't reach part my nose at its longest. Sometimes I feel ok-ish with my chest, but I can't live without my packer, and to me my face shape looks too round but I like my high voice. I'm very musical and artistic and have never really been into the stereotypical 'manly' things. I currently identify as gay (man loving man btw) but have been mistook for a butch lesbian many times. I love BTS, Harry Potter and Marvel, and my main hobby is writing books.

I guess my main fear is that I'm not manly enough to be a trans guy, and I'm scared that even though I want to go on testosterone, I'll end up regretting it. And I don't want to be one of those people who thinks they're trans when they aren't and they were just going through a phase.

1) I'm pre T and want to start it, but I'm oddly scared of needles now. Like doing heroin was fine. But now that I've taken a step back I have such a negative connotation with needles! I know theres a gel but I believe the dose it lower. I also know you dont mainline hormones, which actually feels scarier. Like if your not shooting a vein where does it go?

Extremly repetitive, I know but the point is, I want to change my gender. I want to take hrt, and walk around as a female. No issues here.

Here is where the problems start to come in. 

There is no way in hell I could ever in my life ever, thag I could come out to my family that I'm trans. No doubt they would support me, but I couldn't handle coming out. I do want to take hormones, but I'm afraid I'll regret it later down the line. Lately I have been feeling scuicidal, and reached out for help about that. I forgot all about wanting to be a girl and almost started tp move on. Until I remembered what made me depressed, I can't be a girl. Now it's all coming back to me. The scuicidal thoughts and all. 

I need help. I don't know who to go to. I don't know how to. I don't want to accept myself as a transgender. I will never embrace that part of me.

How can I get rid of these awful thoughts? Is there a way to feel like ME again? I hate this aweful feeling.

The point of this post is not to offend anyone, but to maybe help someone realise that they don't need to transition, if you've already transitioned this post is probably not for you and I'd advise you not to read it.

TL;DR: LSD made me feel comfortable in my body for the first time ever, cancelling my belief that I was transgender.

&amp;#x200B;

I had always felt uncomfortable in my body and I never really felt like I connected with people of my own gender, this peaked in my late teens and I started thinking it was due to me being trans. The signs were there from the early unconsciousness of childhood. I had had dolls and ponies and I remember being confused when my mom wouldn't get me a bathing suit instead of swimming trunks, I also had long hair. I never though that these were strange things for a boy to like, I just liked them.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately (or fortunately as it would turn out) I put these pieces together after my puberty ended and I was already fully grown with very male features. There was no way I could transition and pass, let alone even have the courage to tell anyone that I felt this way. I was convinced I should have been a woman, but I did nothing. For almost a decade I lingered in this limbo like state, due to my situation I felt like life had nothing to offer, I got dealt a shitty hand and I was just passing the time waiting until I was so miserable that I would have to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mid 20s I got interested in drugs thanks to an ecstacy experience, I was blown away that one could have such a radically different experience of the world and I started doing research on other drugs. LSD was my next adventure, with basically a nonexistent harm and addiction profile it seemed like a no brainer to try it, and it saved my life.

&amp;#x200B;

LSD blew away any preconceived notions I had regarding my own identity. All the thoughts, ideas, and stories I told myself of who I were just vanished. For the first time in my life I felt comfortable in my body, not only that but for the first time I felt like I was my body. My body was no longer some abstract thing that I owned and had opinions about, it simply was me and whatever wants and wishes I had for it were irrelevant to reality; it was male therefore I was male.

&amp;#x200B;

I started thinking about why I thought I was transgender and I wasn't that big of a mystery now that I felt comfortable in my body. 

1. I had grown up with a single mom and very little contact with adult males, leaving me with only a female role model to emulate. 
2. I was extremely averse to any physical activity and exercise, we only really get to know our bodies through our use of them, just sitting around playing computer games all day long is a sure way to feel like an alien in ones own body. 
3. Transgenderism for me was a very escapist utopian idea. ""Me and my life is shitty and it must be because I'm in the wrong body, if only I could be my chosen gender then everything would be a paradise""

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't just slip into male existence at once, but now a couple of years after this initial LSD experience (and many, many additional ones) I feel very happy in my body and it almost seems like a mystery how I could ever have felt transgender.

I am trans FtM [17], It's still hard to accept that I am. I have a problem, I always think I fake things. Like depression or anxiety and of course being trans, I always fear am faking it and that's why I stay in the quite to myself and try to make myself think otherwise. But now I am more ready to accept it then ever.


As a child I was always drawn to boyish thing's, would deny the girl things before I even knew that they were for girls. My parents put it off as me being boyish and that I got it cos I grew with two older brother's. And would say me hanging out with other boys' ment me being around potential partners. My dress style didint change much as I grew, I was drawn to more and more masculine stuff, I started to buy my own clothes and my mother would take my opinion into consideration. Would take brothers stuff. So my closet ended up being only guy clothes. My mother always put it off as me having a phase I will grow out of.


I want to come out to my family, but it would be dificult since they wouldn't even understand what ""transgender"" means. My mother has views that are hard to change and always tought that trans people are just people dressing as other gender, and found it disgusting. She suspected that I am gay, and that's why I am more masculine. And said that if I were, she would accept that. But I am very not certain about transgender. She said she would love me in any shape or form. But the issue is- my mother always wanted a daughter. My two brothers were born first and she was dissapointed that she did not get a daughter. When she got the news that she is pregnant again, she hoped it would be a daughter, but the doctors said it will be a son. She was dissapointed. My father imeadiatly said to do abortion, since he did not want a third son, but it was to late. She talked to me like I was a boy for 9 months, until I was born as female. She was happy and excited, her dreams have come true. She always wanted to braid my hair, dress me up into pretty dresses. But since young age I would deny her the pleasure. She grew more and more dissapointed in me and would show the dissapointed quite often. She started to become in denayal, saying that it's just a phase. I don't want to dissapoint her even more. 


My friend, who is trans as well, he and me have this big plan of leaving to another country where he can transition. I did not come out to him, and was in denayal when he was coming out to me. As I said am still scared that I am faking it and that he will lose respect for me if he questions me and think's I am fake. My friend decided to cut of ties with family, since they are toxic, but said he would allow communication if they want to communicate. I am not certain about doing the same. As my mother would simply not understand what does it me that I am a male. And just simply cutting her off would make her think that I hate her and that she failled as a mother or that I don't need her. I wouldn't be able to live with this guilt. And I did not even think what my father would think, would he accept me. Did not think about my two brothers or my grandmother. 


I don't know what to do. I just simply wish I was born as a male, removing every detail of my life and me being known as female. Even if it fucked my life over even more, even if my father would love me less cos I wasn't his first princess. I don't know what should I do with mother, what should I do with my friend who is trans. Maybe I should live my life suffering, just to not hurt the other's. Please help. 

I will appreciate any opionin and suggestion. I am having a turmoil for the longest time.

I am trans FtM [17], It's still hard to accept that I am. I have a problem, I always think I fake things. Like depression or anxiety and of course being trans, I always fear am faking it and that's why I stay in the quite to myself and try to make myself think otherwise. But now I am more ready to accept it then ever.


As a child I was always drawn to boyish thing's, would deny the girl things before I even knew that they were for girls. My parents put it off as me being boyish and that I got it cos I grew with two older brother's. And would say me hanging out with other boys' ment me being around potential partners. My dress style didint change much as I grew, I was drawn to more and more masculine stuff, I started to buy my own clothes and my mother would take my opinion into consideration. Would take brothers stuff. So my closet ended up being only guy clothes. My mother always put it off as me having a phase I will grow out of.


I want to come out to my family, but it would be dificult since they wouldn't even understand what ""transgender"" means. My mother has views that are hard to change and always tought that trans people are just people dressing as other gender, and found it disgusting. She suspected that I am gay, and that's why I am more masculine. And said that if I were, she would accept that. But I am very not certain about transgender. She said she would love me in any shape or form. But the issue is- my mother always wanted a daughter. My two brothers were born first and she was dissapointed that she did not get a daughter. When she got the news that she is pregnant again, she hoped it would be a daughter, but the doctors said it will be a son. She was dissapointed. My father imeadiatly said to do abortion, since he did not want a third son, but it was to late. She talked to me like I was a boy for 9 months, until I was born as female. She was happy and excited, her dreams have come true. She always wanted to braid my hair, dress me up into pretty dresses. But since young age I would deny her the pleasure. She grew more and more dissapointed in me and would show the dissapointed quite often. She started to become in denayal, saying that it's just a phase. I don't want to dissapoint her even more. 


My friend, who is trans as well, he and me have this big plan of leaving to another country where he can transition. I did not come out to him, and was in denayal when he was coming out to me. As I said am still scared that I am faking it and that he will lose respect for me if he questions me and think's I am fake. My friend decided to cut of ties with family, since they are toxic, but said he would allow communication if they want to communicate. I am not certain about doing the same. As my mother would simply not understand what does it me that I am a male. And just simply cutting her off would make her think that I hate her and that she failled as a mother or that I don't need her. I wouldn't be able to live with this guilt. And I did not even think what my father would think, would he accept me. Did not think about my two brothers or my grandmother. 


I don't know what to do. I just simply wish I was born as a male, removing every detail of my life and me being known as female. Even if it fucked my life over even more, even if my father would love me less cos I wasn't his first princess. I don't know what should I do with mother, what should I do with my friend who is trans. Maybe I should live my life suffering, just to not hurt the other's. Please help. 

I will appreciate any opionin and suggestion. I am having a turmoil for the longest time.

I have also never acted like a girl. I liked cars, dressed in male clothes, liked Star Wars, etc. 
I have no attraction to dolls or handbags and dresses. 

I don’t feel any dysphoria for any part of my body. I don’t hate my body, but I like a female one a lot more.

Or is it just that I’m straight and like girls, but somehow my view has been twisted to want to be one.

Is this just because I’ve recently started using reddit and have discovered a new part of the internet? Is it because of how LGBT people are finally rising up and I subconsciously want to join the bandwagon? Is it influences from the internet? 

I don’t know.

1557,2019-09-30 15:18:48,dbd2yq,5,2,"Hi. I’m 18 years old and I’m questioning mtf. I’ve had on and off thoughts about transitioning for the last couple of years, and ever since I was 4 I’ve had thoughts about wanting to be a girl. I remember even pretending to be at a doctors and having my male parts removed and tucking them between my legs and pretending I was a girl. As soon as I found out what being transgender is, I’ve been intrigued by it and haven’t been able to stop thinking that I’m trans since. The want to be a girl is pretty much constantly on my mind. I came out to my girlfriend a few months ago and she was supportive but I also came out to my mum and although she supported me, I got the feeling that she didn’t believe me and I felt very guilty and awkward. Because of this, I shut my feelings away all summer but they eventually came back. I decided to book a therapy session with a gender therapist but the day before I cancelled because I was too scared that I was making the wrong decision and that I’d be wasting my money. 

The reasons that I think it could be a fetish is that I get excited by the thought of transition or whenever I put on girls clothes. I’ve been told this is probably because of gender euphoria and I do get that but I’m not sure. Also, whenever I masturbate these feelings go away for a short while and I feel really guilty again and think to myself that I could’ve made a big mistake and that I’m just going to be a boy from now on. However, my strong desire to be a girl always comes back. 

Maybe I’m just stuck in denial because I’m too scared about what could happen if I did come out e.g. losing friends, being made fun of etc. I just don’t know what to do because I’m stuck in this loop of wanting to be a girl, worrying it’s a fetish, pushing it out of my mind and then all over again. 

Sorry if this doesn’t make much sense I’ve typed this out really quickly and just tried to get all my thoughts down. Any help would be really appreciated :)

This is my first ever Reddit post, so go easy on me.

I decided to create this post to and try see if there are other Trans, or even LGBT people like myself — in a world that’s dominated by, what I like to call, the “crazy LGBT side” — who don’t want to be affiliated with the “community” because of how inane they are.

I am a 22 year old FTM trans man, and I’ve been transitioning since I was about 3 years old. I consider myself a “trans OG”

Anyways, as I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed — as everyone else probably has as well — that the “community” has turned into nothing but overly aggressive “MTF” (i put quotations because I’m honestly convinced most of the MTF community are just fetishizing being trans.) and non binary people spouting hate.

Examples being: Hating almost every “cis straight male”, hating police officers/military, promoting anarchist behavior, and all of this other ridiculous shit.

It actually makes me want to vomit with rage, especially how these kinds of people get their panties in a bunch over “not being respected”, but their entire lives seem to be on a mission of disrespecting EVERYONE that isn’t MTF, FTM or “non binary”

I'm hoping this type of post is welcome here, but if not, please let me know and of course I can delete :) 

Also, wasn't sure if I needed to put a trigger warning for this subject as I know it can be very uncomfortable. 

I'm a cisgender woman, and recently I've become good friends with a trans/genderqueer person. I have never actually met anyone before who isn't cis. When we first met, I wasn't really sure of their pronouns, so I stuck to using they/them when talking with them. HOWEVER, stupidly, when I first saw them, I assumed they were a girl - I know, this is ignorant of me and something that I'm really trying to work on - so when I was messaging another friend about them (before I spoke to them) I sent messages like ""she's really cute"" and ""I'm afraid to talk to her"". This is absolutely my bad. 

After I became friends with them and heard them talk, I just asked their pronouns as it seemed like the best thing to do and seemed like they would be comfortable with me asking. They were happy I asked, and told me their pronouns were they/them or he/him. I updated my friends and family, whom I had spoke to about them, just in case they ever met.

Then I made a mistake. I was talking to them about the texts I sent to my other friend, where I had used she/her, and I accidentally said this outloud. I panicked, said a quick ""I'm so sorry"" and continued with the conversation. 

So, I'm hoping I can get some advice from people who have been misgendered before - what should I do? Should I just not mention this and obviously NEVER misgender them again, or should I bring it up again and apologise properly? Or something else?

So, right now, I’m a male; born and raised. But, I’m starting to not really want to be. It’s mainly about gender roles. Everyone expects me to be attracted to women, want to be super buff, and I’m not supposed to like “feminine” things like cats or having long hair. Recently, I’ve been fantasizing about being a girl. Most of my interests and hobbies would be more “accepted” if I were female. Idk I guess I’m tired of guys getting uncomfortable whenever they find out I’m gay and people thinking I’m weird by being feminine. If I were a girl, things would be “normal.”

Anyway, the main problem is that I don’t think I have dysphoria. My existence isn’t pain, and I don’t hate myself.

I can go on living as a guy, but I feel like my life would be very different and probably better if I were a girl. What should I do?

I hate when I go to queer spaces and they do the ""let's all introduce ourselves and our pronouns"" thing because I don't want to have to pick a pronoun. I don't ""prefer"" any of them. I don't want to be defined by it. Pronouns, even they/them and zi/zer etc, feel gendered in a way, because of my next issue...

2. Nonbinary feels like a gender in of itself. I feel like nonbinary should be all about tearing down the boxes for man and woman but instead it just feels like there's a box for nonbinary now. Like there's a role and pronouns for nonbinary identity. It doesn't feel like shedding away the jail cell that is gender, but just making another cell.

I've known for a while that I wasn't very cishet, known for almost a year. For a while I went by she/her and the name Valoria. Yet it always felt weird to be gendered as female. I always sort of shrugged it off as it just being something you get used to. Last night I was having a conversation with my (very supportive) mother, and we got on the topic of gender expression being a social construct, and I thought to myself; 'what if I'm not a man or a woman?'. I mean, I still have dysphoria, I still want to look androgynous, it just seems so new. The kicker is that I don't really care about the whole 'bigender, demiboy, genderfuck' thing. Not trying to be offensive, but it just isn't my style. I just want to look how I want, do what makes me happy, love my boyfriend, and not have gender skew any of that out of vision.

Sorry in advance if this seems rude or insensitive, but I assure you that it wasn't my intention. Have fun in your endeavours and remember to practice your passion daily♡

40,2019-09-20 18:41:36,d6z7xi,4,18," I'm pretty sure I'm somewhere on the nonbinary scale, though i haven't really found /my/ spot. 

I found greygender is a decent enough spot for now, even if I'm not openly that.

And I dunno. I guess I'm thinking right now about how stressful i find my gender to be. I know that the more girlish I'm pushed to be, the more uncomfortable i am. I always hated being placed in girl groups (for social activities, i definitely don't hate them lol), and i think being forced to dress more feminine gives me some sort of... dysphoria? I know that i don't have to dress that way, but idk. When i do, it feels wrong. Even thinking about it gives me distress. It makes me feel less like myself and like i don't see myself in the mirror. 

I always kind of viewed myself as not really a girl but also not really a boy. Growing up, i wanted to do more of... i guess, male expectation things. And i know the following is based on gender stereotypes and all that, but the point is i did these things to feel more masculine. I wanted to be strong. I took up weightlifting, when men were called, i showed up (pushing cars out of the mud, pushing cars down the road, generally lifting heavy things), i dressed more GNC, and in a weird way, i viewed my friendships with girls like i was a boy. 

But at the same time, i don't really want to be a guy. Like, the whole hrt thing likely isn't something i want. I don't hate my body parts, even if i hate my body as a whole. 

And i guess its just really confusing. And scary, sort of. I don't want to be considered an attention seeker and i guess I'm also afraid that maybe i am just a sort of weird girl who is only at best just gnc.

43,2019-09-23 14:46:25,d87hzl,5,17,"I've been trying to compromise with her for a decade about my clothes. She took me shopping yesterday to find stuff we both like. I almost cried trying on jeans (the kind lady helping us said I had beautiful curves and my dysphoria said ""amen"" and you know how that is. She can't read minds, she didn't do anything wrong, my masculinity has just been very fragile lately? Per usual? Whatever.)

Anyway. I'm layering a plaid shirt she picked out and she blew up at me on the way to my university. Bc my bus stop is en route to her job, we live in Chicago, it's notoriously dangerous, I can't and don't try to convince my family to not worry for my safety. So she drops me off at my bus stop.

She was going on about how I'm asking to be raped and how I upset her and she's not dumb and isn't going to wait three or five years for me to come out as gay. I don't know what it is with people associating presentation with sexuality, and not identity. But whatever. We've been having this talk for almost ten years, now.

My aunt had this conversation with me last week and I came out to her as bisexual. She asked for my pronouns, and I told her they/them. She said ""We [her and my cousins] all already knew, so I don't know why you were so scared of just saying so, babe. I can't judge you because I'm not God. We still love you."" She asked her questions and I gave answers, and I think we both handled it well. It was funny and wholesome and I don't feel unsafe. 

However my mom said that she'd tell her lawyer and judge (she's in court with my dad) to get my dad to stop sending me money. Because I ""don't know how to spend it,"" gesturing to my outfit. *When I didn't suggest we buy clothes. I'm cheap as shit and am trying to save up for a car, and then for a year of rent. She's the one that buys something new literally everyday.* Not that anything is wrong with that. She's just really bad at saving money and doesn't listen to my advice. And she talked me out of accepting job offers, because I'm a freshman in college. We both want me to earn more scholarships. 

Anyway. She then said she isn't sending me to school ""to end up living an alternative lifestyle."" *It's not like I'm earning a degree in education to earn a living on commissions for the rest of my life?? Like??* Anyway. She said that she'd tell the judge to stop my dad from sending me money (because he refused to pay Child Support for over a decade, but I'm 18, now, so that's what the judge says is fair to my mom and I). And then she threatened to stop supporting me. That is if a) she finds out that I was hiding that I'm 'gay,' or b) I come out.

My boyfriend is bi, too, I asked him how he feels about me transitioning eventually, and he says he's absolutely fine with it. He says he wants me to be happy. 

LOL MY FAMILY KEPT ASKING ME IF HE'S GAY but anyway. My mom thinks we're each other's cover up? But the rest of my family like. Believes that we're actually dating lol. He's kinda femme, I'm kinda masc. I have high regards for him. He has high regards for me. They can see it. Lol. 

I came out at 14 and cut my hair without permission, and got kicked out. Like. It was only for a few days, but that was horrible. I couldn't focus in school because I had no idea where I was going to sleep later on. 

My entire family said I'd stay at either a correctional facility or a mercy home. It ended up being my grandmother's house, but I had to pray for change for an hour a day. So it wasn't horrible. I got to eat and sleep and wasn't rained on, and ended up at my mom's place once the dust settled.

But she said not to expect my dog to be home when and if I returned. I was so horrified that she gave him away. 

But I came home and there he was. Everything was a bluff. Only because the rest of my family told my mom that she was overreacting. 

But now I'm grown so like. *I'm a legal adult.*

*LIKE?? I MIGHT BE HOMELESS AGAIN? BUT THIS TIME AS AN ADULT? I AM SCARED AS SHIT BC LIKE. Like. It's reality for some but like. I have a good life, man, and I might lose it all?*

I try to compromise. But I guess it isn't good enough. I tried to wear dresses and do exactly what my mom wants me but ended up literally vomiting upon seeing my reflection. Multiple times. Which is why we both agreed to compromise. 

For a while I dressed too bummy, so I started to plan my outfits in advance. Tried to go for a feminine/androgynous sort of style? Occasionally I'll wear eyeshadow or crop tops, because I think I'm beautiful. Just not...complete? Like. If I didn't look like a VSCO girl in feminine shit, I'd wear it *so* much. I try not to live my life like a prequel, but you know what dysphoria is like. 

So none of that is good enough for her. And now I'm in trouble, and fearing for my safety.

My auntie works minimum wage and is trying to support my cousin. Who is also working minimum wage. I can't move in with either of them. They can't support me. My grandma is homophobic and has heart problems, and I don't want to risk making her ill. My oldest cousin lives too far away from my school to be able to commute daily, reliably.

And my dad is just doing everything he can to hurt my mom because he's petty and never wanted a child. That's why he was so angry about paying child support, and now, so angry about supporting me. If I lived with him, my mom (also has heart issues) might fall ill due to stress, and he would continue to harass her in court. I want no part of that bullshit so that's out, too.

Maybe, if push comes to shove, I can help my Granddad take care of my grandma, and move in with them. *Maybe.* 

My therapist says taking her off my FAFSA is a last resort option. Which is also a roll of a die. 

Still, I'm pushing my resume out there, trying to see if any fish nibble. Offering commissions. Even tried to sell feet pictures for a while on Insta, ngl. Y'know? I'm terrified.

And now I'm scared to go home today. Now I'm scared I'm going to be kicked out again. But this time, nobody can help me. I don't know what to do.

So basically my friend who is the greatest badass person of all time and is just genuinely super amazing and whom I don't know what I'd do without. 

Told me they are 'gender fluid'. Now this seemed like a real big thing to say and I was so happy they felt they could tell me! I was so supportive and listened and honestly told a slight lie about how I understood (which in the sense that I understood their feelings just not the actual concept) cause I did ask them this but even after a few different ways of explaining. I still don't get it. 

 I want to be 100% supportive and obvs it wouldn't change anything in our friendship. You do you- is our life motto basically. 

But I am very confused. 

I understand queer, different sexualities (I'm asexual) and I understand trans as best as a non trans woman can. But gender fluid is something I just can't quite ... Get? 

The way my friend explains- some days they 'feel' more feminine and dress that way and other days it's more masculine. They don't feel like they are one gender. 

Which just confused me more tbh.

From my perspective.

I'm a woman. I 100% know that and am happy with that. 

I'm not 'traditionally feminine'. I wear docs, I hate skirts. I don't wear makeup and I've had both long and short hair styles. 

On the whole I'm not 'feminine'. Yet I know I am still a woman and wouldn't want to change that.

So I really don't get gender fluid.

My friend (and from other people online) say it's about 'feeling' like a gender and clothes can be a big part of expressing that...  but gender isn't about your clothes or 'stereotypes'?... Does my wearing doc boots and jeans make me a guy? Then there's people who say 'don't be stereotypical'

 And if people 'felt' like a man or woman wouldn't that make you trans? 

If you were a guy wanting to wear traditional 'female' clothes like dresses/or females wearing traditional 'male' clothes like tuxedos wouldn't that just make people 'crossdressers' in a formal sense of the word. Like I've been to weddings in pant suits before and no one has 'misgendered me'.  

I painted a girls nails in an after-school club for her and a boy wanted his done- he loved them, but he still knew he was a boy and said so to his mum when she picked him up lol...  

So yeah basically gender fluid is confusing to me and as said, this isn't going to change a friendship. I just want to try and be a good friend and educate myself.

I’m a girl (20F) on the boyish side, but not totally butch. I’m pretty content with being female, I love having a female appearance and I enjoy women’s style and fashion. But I also enjoy incorporating men’s fashion (men’s shirts, jackets, etc.) and having short hair.

I often think about how nice it would be to have a handsome, masculine man as a partner, but then I realized that *damn*, but wouldn’t it be awesome to *be* that handsome boy? You’d probably ask, “but how about being an attractive woman instead?”. Well, yeah that would probably be cool, but I’m not really enticed by the idea of being a beautiful woman. But being a handsome boy? Fuck yeah, that would be sick. I would be so much more confident and outgoing if I were a boy. It would fit my personality more, and I bet I’d be more likeable as a handsome dude than a pretty girl. Boy clothes are so cool and I would love to be tall and well-built. I also feel complemented when girls are attracted to my boyish attributes (like my “traditionally masculine” hobbies, or my boyish-femme fashion). I also like to switch the ways I speak and move depending on how I feel, from feminine to masculine and vice versa.

I have no desire to transition, though. I don’t feel like I was born the wrong sex, and I would still miss being a girl if I “magically” transformed into a biological boy. Maybe this is a gender expression thing? Is this what they call ‘fluidity’? I don’t want to make myself appear completely as a boy, though, in my current female state. I’m still happy with my boyish-femme fashion. But if I had magic biological sex-swapping powers I’d have a lot of fun with it.

And come to think of it, even when I was a little girl, I gravitated towards the male “appearance”. I wanted to be like my older brothers, so I copied their clothes and I even wanted to wear the same school uniform. Preschool me wanted to pee standing up and wanted to have manly muscles (lol).

Hey friends, 

So just like most of these entries start; for as long as I can remember I have always been presenting masculine, have always been uncomfortable with my chest and I have always done everything in my power to make that area look as unnoticeable and flat as possible. 

I wont go into detail about it to much, but this want for a flatter chest developed into a pretty bad eating disorder, that to be fair worked in reducing that area. 

At the point where my ED was hospital level bad, was also a point that I had never felt better in my life about my chest dysphoria (obviously because of the weight loss there). 

Over the last year I have worked on this and can now say Im very nearly recovered - the issue being that I have a larger chest now and this is devastating, my dysphoria is worse then is has ever been and is the reason it was so hard to let go of my ED. Like at a point of wearing 2 binders (I realise this is very fucking bad) 

Anyway, during all this time, I met an amazing boy (21/S/M) who does his absolute best to be as understanding as he can on a daily basis. But its strange though because I never feel dysphoric during sex... and if anything, I enjoy that area during this time.  I know boobs are like a big thing for him an I wouldnt want to jeopardise our relationship because I want top surgery, but crying all the time because im not okay with my chest isnt sustainable either. 

Does anyone else with dysphoria experience this? How can something affecting me so seriously every second of my life, something that takes over a huge portion of  my thoughts just not be a problem in a time where I am exposed the most? 

So I just don't really know what to do. On one hand: I work towards getting top surgery but ruin the relationship I have or on the other hand; suffer with this everyday of my life. But because this isnt an issue during sex and is just day to day.... Maybe breast reduction is an option?

Lately I’ve been reading and watching some stuff about queer theory just from general interest, and it’s made me question a lot about how I perceive my own gender. In hindsight, I think I’ve been questioning my gender for a while now, for a number of reasons:  

* When I was younger I always knew I was different from other boys my age, and chalked this up to the fact that I was gay. But when I was at university I still felt like there was something internal or intrapsychic separating me from the other gay guys. 
* I have never been comfortable talking to my family about my identity as a gay man. My parents know, and they’re very liberal and accepting (or, well-meaning), but it still makes me uncomfortable bringing it up, like it’s an over-simplification. I haven’t told my extended family. I used to think I had some internal conflict over gay stereotypes, like I was scared they’d make incorrect or degrading assumptions about me based on my sexuality, but I think there’s more to it in a way I can’t really describe. 
* This is a difficult one to put into words, but I have never felt like gendered clothes of any kind really ‘express what I feel.’  I don’t think I’d be comfortable wearing ‘women’s clothes’ but I currently just wear variations of a very neutral ‘jeans and a plain t shirt’ style. It still feels like I’m trying to dress ‘as’ something else, but anything more overtly masculine or feminine also doesn’t feel like me. 

So my question is, given that I’ve reached a point of questioning my identity, what could be the best way of reaching an answer? I’m trying not to think in terms of “am I non-binary or am I cisgender,” because that’s another binary choice so maybe defeats the point, but I’d like to have a stronger grasp on how I ultimately identify.

I'm going to keep reading up on queer theory (I ordered a textbook online), and I think meditating might be useful? Also I've been going to therapy for about 3 weeks and I found out last week that my therapist is non-binary, but there are other things I need to address in therapy before I get to this so I think it'll be a while before I start to work on it with them.

I've always thought I want to be a girl, from when I started school, all the way upto the last few months where I've been constantly questioning my thought process.

Prior to learning how the ""what's in your pants"" works between girls and boys I used to try and cut my boy parts off (I didn't succeed, it hurt too much).

Some days I feel more male, some days more female.

This all might seem very trans-like, but I'm ok with having male genitalia, I only like women sexually (not that, that matters), I don't want to transition to female, I'm still jealous of women, but I just want to be me.

When I first started questioning I just felt that I wanted facial hair occasionally. Then as i started questioning more, i realized it was more than that. I want to have a flat chest, a hairy body and facial hair.

When I first started questioning it was like 30% of the time I wanted these things and 70% I didnt. As the years have gone on, it's pretty much 80% of the time I want to have a male body and only 20% I dont. But no matter what my chest bothers me and always has. Even before it was a question of gender.

I thought maybe I was transmasculine. As I dont really have a preferred pronoun and my name doesnt bother me but it's not a super feminine name anyway. 

Then I was worried maybe I just want something I cant have. But I'm pretty sure that's not the case as I really enjoy my body hair that I can grow. I cant remember the last time I bought a razor. I shave my legs maybe once or twice in the summer just to keep people from saying anything and I shave my armpits in the summer. Last winter is the first time I actually let my armpit hair grow and it was amazing. I'm thinking about letting it grow again. 

So basically I want a male body and feel as though I'd be much happier in a male body but I dont really care about pronouns, names and the social aspect. Truthfully transitioning is only really not happening because I dont want to deal with the social outfall of transitioning. I know I'd feel better with a flat chest and hairy body, but I'm unsure that it's worth the social problems that come along with it especially for my kids and husband.

Truthfully transitioning is only really not happening because I dont want to deal with the social outfall of transitioning.

AMAB, nonbinary 'officially' for a couple of years, genderbendy for years before that and probably struggling for decades. I'm also old (42 dammit). Started HRT last year and have been ramping up ultra-slowly and happy in a lot of ways with the changes.

58,2019-09-12 17:54:05,d3bna2,0,1,"Hi there. I'm not sure if this is strictly queer-related, per se,  but it kind of is, and I figured the people here would have more experience in these matters and could give me some advice about this. For the record, I don't really think I'm queer - I'm hetero, I identify with the gender I was born as and have never really felt that I'm a girl or want to be a girl, beyond mild curiousity about what it would feel like, except that sometimes I've envied the concept of feminine beauty and fashion and am very interested in embodying that, if only for a little while. TL;DR I don't want to be a woman or even look like a woman, but I do want to be *pretty* and confident if that makes any sense. This just mainly manifests itself in one aspect of fashion in particular -I'm not asking for psychoanalysis, just a little bit of fashion advice on what is and is not considered appropriate. (That said, I have basically zero understanding of the vast range of identities that fall under the umbrella of ""queer"", so I can't say for certain there's no label that applies to me, just that I don't know of any and haven't really gone looking.)

Anyway, more to the point: I've always been kind of obsessed with women's gymnastics, I always thought it was one of the coolest things  ever that I wished I could do. The vast majority of the times I've randomly pondered ""wouldn't it be cool to be like a girl, not all the time, but just for a little while"" is when I'm watching the amazing artistry of these incredible, graceful athletes. 

Although I never got a  chance to do it as a kid, recently I've been supremely lucky to get a  chance to start taking private gymnastics lessons at my local YMCA as an  adult beginner. I've only had a couple sessions with my instructor so  far, but I'm really liking it - it's so hard, but feels so rewarding! -  and want to keep going with it. I have a great teacher, who's very nice,  understanding, and helpful. She's been teaching me mostly the basics on  the floor, but also some balance beam work. Best of all, I've always  worn a (girl's) leotard to class so far (albeit with shorts over top)  and she hasn't said a word about it, nor said anything about the fact  that (at least on the beam, I don't know that much about floor) I'm  technically learning the girl's stuff. I definitely appreciate how lucky  I am to have this opportunity to fulfill one of my feminine sort-of dreams.

With that in mind...do you guys suppose there's any way I could convince her to let me wear *just*  the leotard to class, without shorts over top? Moreover, is it inappropriate for me to even think about wanting to do that? (Be honest with me if so.) I don't wear makeup, tie my hair back, or do anything particularly feminine for class other than  wearing a girl's leo, but I feel like it would help me feel that much more confident and proud in my body, to run around in just a leotard without shorts, my legs free and  uncovered, like the girls I was so jealous of as a kid did. I'm not a  particularly feminine or masculine guy, but when I try on my leotards in  my room I feel cute and confident in my body for once, and I would like  to enjoy that feeling during practice as well. When I'm in just my leotards, I feel confident and flexible like my legs and arms are  completely free to move and run and flip and do anything I want - I feel beautiful almost, even though I know I don't look remotely feminine in  one. It helps me get close to that ideal of *beauty* in the art and *elegance* in the sport that I'm lacking in pretty much everywhere else in my life (lol.) 

I guess what I'm saying is that there aren't that many things in my wardrobe where I can put them on and think ""Wow, I actually feel almost beautiful"" and ""I like the way my body looks in this"", and this is one of them. I just hope that my desire to feel proud of how my body looks isn't likely to conflict with the rules that my gym has established for the safety and comfort of all the *other* athletes there, who have as much right to feel relaxed and confident as I do.

I do understand the  importance of modesty and why male gymnasts usually wear shorts over  top, and I appreciate how rare an opportunity this is for me, so I'm  hesitant to push my luck by asking about this, but I'd really like to  find a way to do it somehow. (For one thing, although she has no problem  teaching me balance beam, I'm not even sure my instructor *knows*  I'm wearing girl's leotards, since the ones I've worn so far have all  been solid-colored with no fancy designs and fairly gender-neutral  colors.) Am I pushing my luck too much by thinking about this, and would  I, by pursuing this, be endangering a rare opportunity most people (who like gender non-traditional fashion) don't get?

I don't  imagine it would be too difficult to get a gaff or athletic supporter  (or whatever is the best thing to wear underneath for the support that a  girl's leo itself does not provide) FYI I am a college student if that  makes any difference.

80,2019-09-15 01:29:13,d4e3wp,0,1,"My partner and I have been dating for over 4 and a half years. Up until recently, I referred to my partner as my boyfriend, as they had only presented themselves as a man and identified themselves as a man to me for our entire relationship.

I am a bisexual woman, but I am not pansexual. I have a type for both men and women. When I am into women, they are very stereotypically feminine, assertive, and know what they want. I like women with long hair, a curvaceous figure, and who dress very feminine. I like makeup and cute outfits and girly interests. 

When I am into a man, I prefer very masculine hairy men with strong shoulders and jawlines, and deep voices.

I really do not want to offend this community in anyway as I am trying to learn and hopefully find a way to change the way I feel. But as of right now I am not attracted to gender fluid individuals, masculine women, or feminine men. I don’t know why and I can’t help it. It’s just the way I’ve always been. I tried dating an androgynous presenting person a few years back and was entirely put off even though they were nice looking and had a good personality. It’s mental for me. 

My partner is the love of my life. I have never loved someone as much as them. I always saw myself marrying them. I’ve always been incredibly attracted to them as a man and loved the masculine parts of them. It’s what attracted me in the first place! I would not have initially been interested in them if they were presenting as more feminine.

Recently, over a lot of tears, my partner confessed they do not feel like a man. They didn’t like when I call them handsome, refer to them as my boyfriend, or tell them something looks manly on them. This really threw me for a loop because we have had many talks about how they felt insecure and wanted to be even more masculine so they started working out all the time and wanting to grow a beard and other things. I didn’t really care either way as I was attracted to them the way they were and did view them as manly, but I would reassure them that they were plenty masculine enough anyway.

Now that they have come out to me about this, it all makes sense and that phase was likely the result of trying to right some gender dysphoria. 

As they were telling me about how they were feeling, they cried and cried, worried I would lose attraction to them. They talked about how they wanted me to embrace their “feminine energy” sexually and I just didn’t know how to respond because they couldn’t really give me an example of what that meant.

I’m into power play and like being the sub or dom, but it’s never been about gender for me and more about power. It’s the same for me regardless of being with a man or a woman. It’s not like I ever emphasize the fact they have a male body in bed. I never expect them to be the one in control, etc.

They also said they were unhappy with their appearance and wanted to present more feminine and be viewed as pretty. I already think they are pretty but I am reallllly not attracted to this idea. If they were to grow their hair out, wear makeup, or wear female clothes, I think I would really lose attraction.

I’m really struggling here. I don’t want to be judgmental and prejudiced. I am really trying to understand where they are coming from and have been using exclusively gender neutral pronouns and terms to refer to them while we work through this, but I can just feel my mental attraction fading.

They have clarified they are not transgender and do not wish to be female, but just do not feel like a man and wish to play with gender barriers. 

I’ve been crying over this a lot lately because I love them so much. I love them so much that I want to work through this desperately and just force myself to feel the same attraction for them but I just can’t. 

What is wrong with me? Why do I feel this way? 
I don’t want them to be unhappy and experience this dysphoria. I want them to be true to themselves and to be confident because they deserve that. They’re the best person I know but I just feel like I lost my boyfriend when they became my partner.  I just can’t force the physical attraction when they are feminine.

Please help me. How do I come to terms with this? They are the love of my life and I’m just so confused and feel like I’m preventing their growth and like I’m the shittiest girlfriend in the world.

81,2019-09-15 03:54:25,d4fknw,3,2,"This might be long, this is my first time using reddit but ive been really confused and unhappy about my identity for a while and i think it would be a good time to ask some people who may have more insight. This also may be all over the place, im tired at the moment.

I'm in highschool and also AFAB, and i currently just say im a girl to people i greet. throughout my entire life ive never really liked saying that either. I dont think im cis but i dont really know much about being trans or any other identity. Maybe im just a cis person whos thinking too hard about things, who knows. I cant discuss this with my family since they are really lgbtphobic and whatever i do decide it will be a struggle to not fit into their gender roles they make me strictly follow by.

growing up i never liked conventionally girly things, ive never really made friends with girls, i dont even like to wear womans clothing. I dont really hate my body, its not very feminine (im very flat) but im too skinny to be considered masculine. Though, i just hate when people call me a girl or recognize me as a woman. I vaguely remember telling a classmate in early grade school that i might end up being a 'transgender person', and cut all of my hair off (something ive wanted to do since i was 5) When people call me non feminine pronouns, 'him' or 'they', or refer to me by my nickname (which isnt as feminine as my real name) it just feels right.

Heres the confusing part to this entire situation, in my head when i picture myself, i almost always see myself as someone who is genderless or maybe as male. Online ive always just passed as a dude.

I dont think im cis but i dont really know much about being trans or any other identity. Maybe im just a cis person whos thinking too hard about things, who knows. I cant discuss this with my family since they are really lgbtphobic and whatever i do decide it will be a struggle to not fit into their gender roles they make me strictly follow by.\n\ngrowing up i never liked conventionally girly things, ive never really made friends with girls, i dont even like to wear womans clothing. I dont really hate my body, its not very feminine (im very flat) but im too skinny to be considered masculine. Though, i just hate when people call me a girl or recognize me as a woman. I vaguely remember telling a classmate in early grade school that i might end up being a 'transgender person', and cut all of my hair off (something ive wanted to do since i was 5) When people call me non feminine pronouns, 'him' or 'they', or refer to me by my nickname (which isnt as feminine as my real name) it just feels right.\n\nHeres the confusing part to this entire situation, in my head when i picture myself, i almost always see myself as someone who is genderless or maybe as male.

For example,

u (او) is used for both ""he"" and ""she"" (common gender);

ishān (ایشان) is used for both ""he"" and ""she"" but in formal contexts and writing;

ān (آن) is used for ""it"" (neuter gender).

In Persian, the same nouns are used for male and female professionals. For example: bāzigar (بازیگر) means both actor and actress. Pish khedmat(پیشخدمت) might mean waiter or waitress. The noun suffix -ash (اَش) serves either as a possessive adjective or an object pronoun for both males and females as well as things, situations, etc. For example,
ketābash (کتابش) means ""her/his book"";pāyash (پایش) means ""/her/his/its leg"";

U labash rā busid (او لبش را بوسید) means ""He kissed her lips"" or ""she kissed his lips"" or ""he kissed his lips"" or ""she kissed her lips"" or even ""a person of indeterminate gender kissed another person of indeterminate gender's lips."" If we consider -ash as an object pronoun we can translate the sentence as ""she/he kissed her/him on the lips"".

\[I'd love to hear about your story, thank you very much in advance if you decide to share\]

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my experience if you're interested:

I've been questioning my gender for over a yearHow and when did you ""figure out"" your gender? How and when did you ""know""?

 now and I've still not quite figured it out.

I've been thinking I might be ***non binary*** and ***genderfluid***, but I'm still not sure.

* I'm ***AFAB*** and I don't feel legitimate as I feel like my gender *fluctuates*, I happen to feel ""*woman-ly*\*\*""\*\* and *nb*, or something else than ""*woman*"" as in a ""*gray area*"". (I had a point where I thought I was *bigender*, more specifically *bigirl*, but saying *bigirl* gives the girl part too much attention, which doesn't feel as right as it used to)
* I would not feel comfortable with ""he/him"" pronouns. But I do with ***she/her*** and ***they/them*** pronouns. Although, I really dislike to be referred to ""madam"" or such things.
* I deeply reject social gender norms as well, but I don't know if it's because I'm deconstructing myself from social constructs or because it's on a personal level.
* The same goes for the clothes I wear, I like clothes from the men's and women's section. I sometimes like to wear one more than the other, it fluctuates.
* I also like to have body hair and not shave them which makes me feel good and less ""woman-ly"" (as in the social stereotype and norm for women), and more me? like ""damn I don't look \*stereotypically or typically to disgusting social norms\* like a woman""
* I used to ""defend"" nb people, and it'd hurt when they would get misgendered or invalidated by others. However, now it hurts me on an another level. Personal level.

When I talk about it I'm feeling very good and authentic. Then when I don't talk about it, I feel like it's all a lie? and I feel weird? **Especially** after talking about it with close-friends as they don't know much about it all...

&amp;#x200B;

I'm genderqueer, I'm queer. I'll say that so I don't have to put any gender or anything on it whilst figuring it all out. Talking about it now, I'd say I'm NB. Ugh.

Someone accidentally referring to me as ""them"", reading a book with a non-binary character, following nb people on internet, talking about it to a couple of people around me, and Sam Smith coming out as non binary pushed me to talk about trying they/them pronouns to my close friends. And questioning my gender even more.

&amp;#x200B;

May your story click in me or push me to do more lol

Recently I saw this tweet: “Nonbinary gender identity is not dependent on body type, visibility of secondary sex characteristics, or dress aesthetic.”

So if gender isn't about those things what is it about? What else is there?

And then I saw someone say something like ""I realized I was agender when I asked myself how trans people 'just knew' what gender they were.""

Which is something I've also wondered. I don't think I feel female, or male, or anything, but how would I know, if I've always felt this way? (Do cis people actually feel like they're their gender? What does being female feel like, and how does male feel differently?)

And then last week I heard about xenogender and my reaction was half ""is this a joke?"" and half ""if this person's gender is forest, why do I have to be a girl?""

Hi, I'm a 27yo AFAB person, been identifying as genderfluid for the past 6 years or so. In these years, I've sometimes wondered whether I was maybe a man instead of a genderfluid person, but then usually concluded that that was probably not the case, for whatever reason. I usually dress rather femme, disphoria goes up and down but lately the need to not have a chest has been high so I finally bit the bullet and ordered a binder. It arrived yesterday, and it fits great. Yay!

Now, I'm bi/pan and polyamorous, so been dating a few people and they're all super supportive. There's a cis guy I've been seeing for about 6 months, and he's not great in expressing his thoughts and feelings so he didn't say much about it, I think he's probably adjusting to things as he's only dated cis women before. We had a nice evening and then got frisky, and though I usually never have an issue with this, suddenly penetration felt weird. Even with fingers. The physical sensation was nice, but somehow it felt... off. Even though before yesterday, I've absolutely loved it most of the time.

So, for context, I'm AFAB and I've always been a bit of a tomboy, but I come from a traditional family so I ended up presenting very femme when I started puberty. Society got into my brain too, it told me that I had to be feminine, show my curves, wear a cleavage, long hair, makeup, etc. Y'all know the deal. And so I did. Until this summer (I'm 24), after a very bad relationship and breakup, I realized that my appearance has never been my own. With the years, I've tried to go back to the tomboyish look, but only enough so that I wouldn't be judged. 

Here's where the gender thing comes in. My country is pretty traditional, I only learned what non-binary meant a couple years ago. And I've always questioned my relationship with gender, but never consciously till now. Until this summer, I just felt bad because even though I didn't want to be a boy, I felt as though the ""girl"" label wasn't right. And people told me that I'm just more masculine, tomboy, or a lesbian (?), etc. 

Regarding my body, I always wore my brother's clothes, and boy's swimsuits when I was a child (I live in a pretty hot country), and it took a lot of convincing for me to wear a bikini, and even then, I refused to wear the top part of it. When I went into puberty and had to wear the top, it was very dramatic for me. Bras were also very dramatic, so I started wearing sport bras that made me flatter. And still nowadays, I tend to go for a flatter look. I also tend to like pants that make me less ""curvy"". 

And the most dramatic part of it all, and where all of this comes from: my hair. I've worn it very long for years, but I always wear it up because I don't like it. I've been wanting to cut it for years, but I'm always told that ""it's too pretty"" or that I'll lose my sex appeal or whatever. And this summer, I kind of decided to do it (still haven't done it yet, I'm too afraid in case I actually lose the one thing that's pretty about me). 

Basically all this time I've been dressing femme for other people, wearing long hair for other people, acting more ladylike for other people. And for years I've thought that this ""girl"" label doesn't fit, but I don't feel non-binary enough, as if I don't fit the criteria. As if I'm just a masculine girl who doesn't like traditional gender roles, and that's it. Because even though I don't like the girl label, I don't really have dysphoria (apart from wanting to be flatter and less curvy, but I solve that with clothes and not looking at myself in the mirror that much), I don't care about she/her pronouns, I'm okay with my private parts... I basically feel like I'm underestimating people who are actually trans or actually enby.

118,2019-09-20 04:40:57,d6pucc,2,6,"Ok, so growing up, I never felt ""girly"".  I'm older than most on here, and I grew up during a different time (Gen X, not Gen Z).  I grew up around a lot of LGBT people because my mom worked with a lot of them, and a good majority were her friends.  My strongest male role models were the couple that lived downstairs from us when I was a little girl.  Dan and Dale.  Dale was aloof, but caring.  Dan, on the other hand was wonderful.  He'd sit with me and answer my ten thousand questions, he let me watch movies, taught me how to ride a bike, and when they were outside, I got to play with their dogs and spend time with them.  I felt the loss very deeply when they both died of AIDS.  I still miss them all these years later.  

&amp;#x200B;

My mom didn't figure out she was asexual until she was in her sixties.  All she knew was that she did not enjoy sex.  She enjoyed the romance though.  She was never feminine when I was growing up, and I think I can count on one hand the number of times I ever saw her wear a skirt or dress.  She just wasn't comfortable in them.  So these were my role models growing up.  I have an aunt that was feminine, and she still is, though now she prefers her tee shirts and pajama pants when she's at home, and tee shirts and jeans when she goes out.  Long gone are the tight tank tops, flowy dresses, etc.  

&amp;#x200B;

Growing up with these people influencing me, and living in a time where if you were a girl, you were supposed to act like one and dress like one, but I hated dresses.  They made me uncomfortable.  I had the long hair that came down past my butt because my mom wanted me to grow it out.  She loved my hair, so I wasn't allowed to cut it until I was ten and we moved from the city to the suburbs.  Basically it was the attitude of ""New school, New you"", and I took advantage.  I cut my hair above my shoulders, and it was so freeing.  My first day of school, I wore a matching sweatsuit.  It was light blue and my gym shoes.  I felt comfortable for the first time.  

&amp;#x200B;

As I grew up, I fluctuated.  My hair was short in 8th grade so I could play basketball (I was on the team.  Preferred that to cheerleading, though I did try out for that because my best friend did.  She didn't want to do it alone.  That made me so uncomfortable.  I didn't get on the squad and I was glad. Neither did she.  I was always very sports-oriented.  I took ballet when I was really little because my mom wanted me to, but as soon as I hit elementary school, sports were all I wanted to do.  I ran cross country, played soccer, did gymnastics, and then later played basketball.  It was confusing for me because I would play Barbies, and I enjoyed it, but I  played cops and robbers with the neighborhood boys too.  As far as clothing went, I wore whatever made me comfortable.  One day might be jeans and a tee-shirt, the next a tee shirt and jean skirt.  I learned as I got older to wear what I was comfortable in.  

&amp;#x200B;

In high school, while the girls were all experimenting with makeup and trying to look as pretty as possible, I was busy playing D&amp;D with the guys or playing Blackjack in homeroom with my least feminine friend (who is now my best friend.   
 She wasn't back then).  To fit in I played with styling my hair a bit but even though I had grown it out again, 99.99% of the time it was pulled back in a ponytail and I was cursing it because ponytails gave me headaches.  Then came graduation.   
 I went off to college while my female friends all started getting pregnant and having babies.  I did a year of college, then shocked all the girls by joining the army.  I felt good in the military.  I was wearing the same thing as the guys, but as the girls too, and it felt good, it felt right.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd had crushes on boys way back in kindergarten (his name was Alex), but then I started having crushes on girls too.  My first celebrity crush was Claire Danes.  I thought she was so pretty, and I wanted to kiss her.  At that age, no one told me you could like boys AND girls.  I didn't learn that until much later.  I never once heard the term bisexual as a child.  I've always been very linear with my thinking, so if I wasn't told it was a possibility, I didn't even consider it.  And no one talked about it, so I didn't know it was a thing.  So it confused me that I liked both.  It was gay, lesbian, or straight.  That was it.  But I had some other crushes that confused me.  I liked a couple of gay guys, a few that liked makeup about as much as the girls did, though they didn't identify as gay, etc.  After coming home from the army, I felt lost.  I had the long hair that I twisted up under my helmet while I'd been there because I felt like it was the one feminine thing about me when nothing else was.  I was sad the day I cut it.  I got over it though.

&amp;#x200B;

So I went into security.  Again, the uniforms were unisex, and I felt good wearing mine.  A few friends were like ""You look like a guy wearing that"" and while they thought it was a burn, I liked it.  Then I met the father of my children.  He was a huge mistake, though my kids were not.  He insisted that I be feminine.  He bought me lacy thongs, tight pants, tight blouses, lingerie, heels, makeup, and I wanted to please him, so I wore that stuff.  Part of me was miserable the entire time.  When we split, it was an enormous relief.  But for a long time, I sort of forgot who I was.  I was still in ""feminine mode"" for years after.  Then one day, I put on men's clothes.  It was amazing.  But it didn't last.  After a while I wanted my tank tops and tight leggings.  I fluctuated back and forth so much I felt like a ping pong ball.  Then I sort of...got stuck in the middle.  The middle felt right.  I started dressing for me, wearing what I felt comfortable in.  I cut my hair short, wore a faux hawk for a while, colored my hair funky colors, and I was truly happy.  I still am happy.  I live about 80% in the middle.  Then I'll feel more feminine for a little while.  It'll swing over to masculine, and I'll feel that way for a long time before slipping back into that middle place.  Now?  In the middle?  I'll wear an overside tee shirt with leggings, I'll wear men's shorts with a women's tee shirt, I'll wear a dress with a hoodie, etc.  About 90% of the time I dress smack down the middle.  Right now I'm wearing a flowered pajama top that is a flowy tank top, with men's shorts.  I wore boxer briefs for the longest time, until my latex allergy got so bad that I couldn't anymore.  I had full body rashes and I hurt, so I went reluctantly back to panties, but with a covered waistband.  I've adjusted to them.  It's just how I am.  

&amp;#x200B;

My middle place, I don't feel like any gender.  I'm just...me.  My ears and nose are pierced, but I have tattoos that aren't feminine.  The one I got a few weeks ago is a quarter moon with a black cat sitting on it, because I have 2 black cats.  The artist got the colors wrong though, so I need to go somewhere else and get it fixed.  The next two tattoos I get are basically neutral.  It's just how I am.  Now what I can't figure out is, am I nonbinary?  Am I gender fluid?  Even when I feel more feminine or more masculine, I still feel more neutral.  I sometimes experience gender dysphoria, but that's usually when I do that swing.  When I'm feeling feminine I hate my lack of curves, the fact that I STILL can't do makeup right, and a few other things.  When I feel more masculine, I HATE having breasts, so I'll wear baggy shirts and sweat jackets.  I also hate that I don't have a penis during those times.  I hate having a vagina and the very idea of penetration is awful during that time.  I still sort of feel that way when I'm in the middle, leaning towards what I hate when I'm feeling masculine.  Except for the sex.  Penetration goes back to being ok for me.  

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know if nonbinary fits.  I identify as panromantic/demisexual, but am still unsure about genders, or if genders even fit at all.  I never felt like a girl.  Even in the dresses, curled hair and makeup, I just felt like I wasn't anything.  Does that make sense?  Even feeling masculine I don't feel that I am a man.  Am I making any sense?  This is why I can't figure it out.  I know, labels don't really matter, and as far as attraction goes, it really runs the gamut.  Currently I'm in my in-between place, where I do and wear my mix of clothing.  Growing up while my female friends were watching romance movies and gushing over the cute clothes the girls were wearing, or how cute the boys were and how cute the couples were, I was off watching horror movies.  I despise romance movies, except for one month of the year: December.  I watch those stupid, predictable, cheesy Christmas romance movies.  I don't know why, they suck, but that is the ONLY time I will watch anything even remotely romantic.  I stick to horror, thrillers, and action, almost exclusively.  Once in a while a comedy will be thrown in.

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I just babbled, but I'm just wanting to know where I fit.  My older child is nonbinary, they/them, he/him pronouns, but was born with a vagina.  Is that what I say?  Is that the appropriate way to say it?  My younger daughter is female, bisexual with a heavy lean towards men.  It's about a 90/10 mix.  She's had a few girlfriends.  She's aromantic/bisexual.  I hope I described that right.  Ah!  This stuff is so confusing!!!  Anything on this subject would be greatly appreciated.",genderqueer,"Advice?

I\'m older than most on here, and I grew up during a different time (Gen X, not Gen Z).  I grew up around a lot of LGBT people because my mom worked with a lot of them, and a good majority were her friends.  My strongest male role models were the couple that lived downstairs from us when I was a little girl.  Dan and Dale.  Dale was aloof, but caring.  Dan, on the other hand was wonderful.  He\'d sit with me and answer my ten thousand questions, he let me watch movies, taught me how to ride a bike, and when they were outside, I got to play with their dogs and spend time with them.  I felt the loss very deeply when they both died of AIDS.  I still miss them all these years later.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy mom didn\'t figure out she was asexual until she was in her sixties.  All she knew was that she did not enjoy sex.  She enjoyed the romance though.  She was never feminine when I was growing up, and I think I can count on one hand the number of times I ever saw her wear a skirt or dress.  She just wasn\'t comfortable in them.  So these were my role models growing up.  I have an aunt that was feminine, and she still is, though now she prefers her tee shirts and pajama pants when she\'s at home, and tee shirts and jeans when she goes out.  Long gone are the tight tank tops, flowy dresses, etc.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGrowing up with these people influencing me, and living in a time where if you were a girl, you were supposed to act like one and dress like one, but I hated dresses.  They made me uncomfortable.  I had the long hair that came down past my butt because my mom wanted me to grow it out.  She loved my hair, so I wasn\'t allowed to cut it until I was ten and we moved from the city to the suburbs.  Basically it was the attitude of ""New school, New you"", and I took advantage.  I cut my hair above my shoulders, and it was so freeing.  My first day of school, I wore a matching sweatsuit.  It was light blue and my gym shoes.  I felt comfortable for the first time.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs I grew up, I fluctuated.  My hair was short in 8th grade so I could play basketball (I was on the team.  Preferred that to cheerleading, though I did try out for that because my best friend did.  She didn\'t want to do it alone.  That made me so uncomfortable.  I didn\'t get on the squad and I was glad. Neither did she.  I was always very sports-oriented.  I took ballet when I was really little because my mom wanted me to, but as soon as I hit elementary school, sports were all I wanted to do.  I ran cross country, played soccer, did gymnastics, and then later played basketball.  It was confusing for me because I would play Barbies, and I enjoyed it, but I  played cops and robbers with the neighborhood boys too.  As far as clothing went, I wore whatever made me comfortable.  One day might be jeans and a tee-shirt, the next a tee shirt and jean skirt.  I learned as I got older to wear what I was comfortable in.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIn high school, while the girls were all experimenting with makeup and trying to look as pretty as possible, I was busy playing D&amp;D with the guys or playing Blackjack in homeroom with my least feminine friend (who is now my best friend.   \n She wasn\'t back then).  To fit in I played with styling my hair a bit but even though I had grown it out again, 99.99% of the time it was pulled back in a ponytail and I was cursing it because ponytails gave me headaches.  Then came graduation.   \n I went off to college while my female friends all started getting pregnant and having babies.  I did a year of college, then shocked all the girls by joining the army.  I felt good in the military.  I was wearing the same thing as the guys, but as the girls too, and it felt good, it felt right.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'d had crushes on boys way back in kindergarten (his name was Alex), but then I started having crushes on girls too.  My first celebrity crush was Claire Danes.  I thought she was so pretty, and I wanted to kiss her.  At that age, no one told me you could like boys AND girls.  I didn\'t learn that until much later.  I never once heard the term bisexual as a child.  I\'ve always been very linear with my thinking, so if I wasn\'t told it was a possibility, I didn\'t even consider it.  And no one talked about it, so I didn\'t know it was a thing.  So it confused me that I liked both.  It was gay, lesbian, or straight.  That was it.  But I had some other crushes that confused me.  I liked a couple of gay guys, a few that liked makeup about as much as the girls did, though they didn\'t identify as gay, etc.  After coming home from the army, I felt lost.  I had the long hair that I twisted up under my helmet while I\'d been there because I felt like it was the one feminine thing about me when nothing else was.  I was sad the day I cut it.  I got over it though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo I went into security.  Again, the uniforms were unisex, and I felt good wearing mine.  A few friends were like ""You look like a guy wearing that"" and while they thought it was a burn, I liked it.  Then I met the father of my children.  He was a huge mistake, though my kids were not.  He insisted that I be feminine.  He bought me lacy thongs, tight pants, tight blouses, lingerie, heels, makeup, and I wanted to please him, so I wore that stuff.  Part of me was miserable the entire time.  When we split, it was an enormous relief.  But for a long time, I sort of forgot who I was.  I was still in ""feminine mode"" for years after.  Then one day, I put on men\'s clothes.  It was amazing.  But it didn\'t last.  After a while I wanted my tank tops and tight leggings.  I fluctuated back and forth so much I felt like a ping pong ball.  Then I sort of...got stuck in the middle.  The middle felt right.  I started dressing for me, wearing what I felt comfortable in.  I cut my hair short, wore a faux hawk for a while, colored my hair funky colors, and I was truly happy.  I still am happy.  I live about 80% in the middle.  Then I\'ll feel more feminine for a little while.  It\'ll swing over to masculine, and I\'ll feel that way for a long time before slipping back into that middle place.  Now?  In the middle?  I\'ll wear an overside tee shirt with leggings, I\'ll wear men\'s shorts with a women\'s tee shirt, I\'ll wear a dress with a hoodie, etc.  About 90% of the time I dress smack down the middle.

124,2019-09-21 04:14:31,d75vw9,3,3,"ok ok so also if anyone’s curious why I’m going back on T if I was dysphoric and lowkey miserable on T before, here’s the scoop --- tw for mentions of dysphoria (obviously), health issues, and eating disorders

Firstly, a lot of the issues I had while on T also had to do with how bad my mental and physical health were at the time - I was gaining a lot of weight and my anxiety and CFS were getting worse and those things are DEFINITELY related and T just kind of created the perfect storm to make me unhappy 

And, yes, some of the changes gave me whole new dysphoria! While I experienced dysphoria over my genitals and sometimes my chest and definitely my voice and height pre-T, on T the facial hair growth and the changes in my face and body shape were very upsetting to me (although, looking back, how much of that was due to weight gain and the worsening of my eating disorder is up for debate) 

Here’s the thing, though, is that I think also a lot of my struggle was with how incredibly fast changes were happening. It was like one day I recognized myself and the next day I didn’t. I was anxious, scared, intimidated, and felt ashamed that I had somehow made the wrong choice. It didn’t help that I realized part of why I’d started T was because I felt pressured by the queer community to medically transition even though I myself wasn’t totally sure about what I wanted yet. 

So, now my mental and physical health are in the best shape they’ve really even been in, even if neither are perfect y’know, and I’ve started to get my weight back under control. And with a lot of stress off my shoulders finally, dysphoria has really started to creep back in in a way it hasn’t in a long time, because I finally have the brainspace to process it. And I put a lot of thought into it, consulted with multiple drs and my therapist and my partners and friends and family, and I decided I wanted to try T again, at a much lower dose this time.

The way I see it, slower and milder changes is much more up my alley, and I know how to cope with and mitigate the less than pleasant side effects much better now than I did a year and a half ago. And honestly? I don’t totally plan to stay on low dose T forever either! I might change my mind and stay on, but mostly I want to complete and/or enhance some aspects of my transition that were put on hold before - like my voice needs to finish dropping, I’d like more bottom growth because oh BOY the euphoria I got from that was strong, and I’d be fine with more body hair and I’d like to work at building up muscles maybe this time, and most of that will stick around or only somewhat soften if I go off T again someday. 

Being nonbinary, really having any kind of complicated relationship with gender even if you are binary and tbh what trans person has a simple relationship with gender, can mean finding a nontraditional route of transition that can involve stopping, starting, and detransitioning and that’s super valid and doable! The important thing is that we all make the choices that ultimately make us happiest in our own skin.

Along with things like eating meat (something I still haven't dealt with, myself), and adding fragrance to every goddamn thing, it'll be something we're appalled by when we look back from a future society that is more accepting of gender as it appears naturally, with no need to label it.

Imagine in this society it were socially acceptable for women to have a penis. In this society, there would be no need to tie destiny (preferred gender) to biology (sex). Wouldn't that be lovely? I see no reason not to try to make right now into this future. I mean, tuck it in the meantime, but perhaps we can slowly help people acclimate to the idea of a feminine penis, instead of inverting them into expensive vaginas. It's a huge gaslight to make money off of people, it seems. May as well be a designer bag, except you better be damn sure you're not getting a knockoff, because this purchase is forever. Granted, there are trans people for whom the dysphoria isn't worth it. But if you can stand even one more day with the genitals you were born with, you should.

In this society, there would be no need to tie destiny (preferred gender) to biology (sex). Wouldn't that be lovely? I see no reason not to try to make right now into this future.

I go as far as wanting the stereotypically ideal hourglass figure and a feminine body and face to wanting to bulk up as a man and work on my masculine side and fitness, but some days I feel I am forcing being a guy but other days I see my desires to be a woman as delusional and unnecessary, I feel pulled from both sides and like I am stuck in the middle and I feel no matter what I do I will piss off one of them so to speak.

36,2019-09-04 00:26:59,czdd4p,2,8,"Ok, hi i'm new to Reddit! This is actually my first ever post, still trying to get things down. I joined mostly so I could join LGBT groups, but mainly this one. I'd like to be a part of this community and kinda find myself idk :))).

This is gonna be like my entire life story lol and I don't know exactly how to start this so bear with me.

So I'm 20 yrs old (AMAB) and completing my last year in college at ECU. I've always felt conflicted about my gender and sexuality mostly because I didn't have the words to really express to myself who I really am, but I have recently confronted the emotions I've been repressing all of my life. 

I'm pretty sure I'm genderfluid my dudes!!!

I've experienced dysphoria all of my life. Ever since I was little I would occasionally feel this intense urge that I was a girl. But this wasn't always. It would be about once a week or so, or sometimes very strongly for a month and then not at all. And I would put these feelings off too, never confront them because I didn't really know what these feelings meant. My elementary school was very homophobic-- boys and girls were dating as young as 6-7 years old and you would get picked on and beat up if you displayed any gay tendencies. This was around the time I started crossdressing secretly. I would tie my sweatshirt around my waist and pretend it was a skirt. I would then tie a towel or T-shirt on my head and pretend it was my long hair. I would pull up my shirt I was wearing on my body, tie it, and pretend it was a belly-top and I would put on my mom's high heels when no one was looking. I would sit differently, with my legs crossed, and walk with my hips swiveled, like a woman, and I would feel very validated.

Sometimes I would want for my mom to put makeup on me, and she did sometimes because she wanted to and not because I ever asked her to, because I never did. Every time she asked me to I would tell her no, ""that's gay"". And then after some time I would give in and pretend I didn't like it. Then I would look at myself in the mirror and be happy I was so beautiful. I would identify secretly to myself as a girl, not simply as a feminine boy. I was so happy too with how much I looked like a girl! I didn't always feel like a girl growing up, though. Post-puberty I developed gynecomastia (swollen chest tissue) which I still have and I became conflicted about it-- because on one end of the spectrum I really hated it for making me look less like a man, but I also liked having breasts that I could play with and even lick my nipples (sorry). The thing is I don't always want to be a woman! Only sometimes (40% of the time) do I feel like I need to be one, and other times (40%) I want to be a man and 20% of the time I just don't give it a thought. Idk its kinda complicated for me to explain and I don't have all the language I would need in order to quite yet. Im still figuring a lot out.

So in high school, we did this thing where students would crossdress for spirit week (opposite day). At first I was reluctant to participate but my mom convinced me that everyone would be doing it so I decided why not. She gave me one of her multicolored dresses that I wore over a pink and navy blue striped polo and I put a necklace on. I loved how I looked in the mirror. In one of my classes the girls saw me and some other 'boys' who were crossdressing for the day and offered to do our makeup. I said yes, and it was the first time I ever wore eyeliner and mascara and foundation. Although some people did judge, more or less everyone was supportive. I looked at myself at the end of the day in the bathroom mirror and thought ""wow I'd be so pretty as a girl"". This trend of crossdressing and looking in the mirror would continue all the way until now. It was only recently that I really gave it any thought.

I came out as bisexual to my mom and it didn't end well for me. The same process it took for me to realize I was bisexual I had for my realization I was genderfluid. At first I thought that me being attracted to men made me gay. The first time I came out to anyone as LGBT it was to my mom as gay, because I believed that you couldn't like multiple genders. But then I realized that sexuality is fluid and that I could be attracted to all genders! In regards to discovering my gender, I would be in the shower thinking about how much I want a vagina right now, and breasts and hips and a feminine face, and this would not be all of the time, so I made nothing out of it. Until one day I introspected and said to myself, ""hey you might be what you feared you were"". So I gave it some thought and gave legitimacy to that thought and soon it turned into a deep conviction.

It's difficult to explain, but at first, I chocked up me being attracted to men as me fulfilling that inner desire to be a woman. I associated the two when there is no correlation. This is why it took me a long time to realize that in addition to being bisexual I am also genderfluid. I felt as if being genderfluid was antithetical to being bisexual without taking into account that gender attraction is actually separate from gender expression.  

I have weird feelings about my breasts, as I mentioned before, so right now I am working on developing a very muscular build. It's been about a year and a half of me actually seriously exercising and I'm actually making semi-decent progress. But I also kinda would like to transition some time in the future. I was thinking about getting chest surgery to remove my breasts to look more like a man but I also would like to transition into a woman, take estrogen, some time in the future, even though I know it wont solve everything about my dysphoria, especially the side of me that wants to look more like a man. I would still like to transition at least once though so I can know what it feels like and see if I can become any happier from it. I know that if I remove my breasts, they wont be as big when I transition. I feel like im in a catch 22. And I don't wish to look ambiguous because it will magnify my dysphoria even more (no offense to nonconforming gender presentation). It just isn't for me. I wouldn't feel free that way.

Any tips or advice? Im so nervous, Ive never done anything like this before, I feel like Im finding out all this stuff and I dont know how to react or properly be my gender. I just wanna do what I can to alleviate my dysphoria a little and maybe become happier.

This is actually my first ever post, still trying to get things down. I joined mostly so I could join LGBT groups, but mainly this one. I\'d like to be a part of this community and kinda find myself idk :))).\n\nThis is gonna be like my entire life story lol and I don\'t know exactly how to start this so bear with me.\n\nSo I\'m 20 yrs old (AMAB) and completing my last year in college at ECU. I\'ve always felt conflicted about my gender and sexuality mostly because I didn\'t have the words to really express to myself who I really am, but I have recently confronted the emotions I\'ve been repressing all of my life. \n\nI\'m pretty sure I\'m genderfluid my dudes!!!\n\nI\'ve experienced dysphoria all of my life. Ever since I was little I would occasionally feel this intense urge that I was a girl. But this wasn\'t always. It would be about once a week or so, or sometimes very strongly for a month and then not at all. And I would put these feelings off too, never confront them because I didn\'t really know what these feelings meant. My elementary school was very homophobic-- boys and girls were dating as young as 6-7 years old and you would get picked on and beat up if you displayed any gay tendencies. This was around the time I started crossdressing secretly. I would tie my sweatshirt around my waist and pretend it was a skirt. I would then tie a towel or T-shirt on my head and pretend it was my long hair. I would pull up my shirt I was wearing on my body, tie it, and pretend it was a belly-top and I would put on my mom\'s high heels when no one was looking. I would sit differently, with my legs crossed, and walk with my hips swiveled, like a woman, and I would feel very validated.\n\nSometimes I would want for my mom to put makeup on me, and she did sometimes because she wanted to and not because I ever asked her to, because I never did. Every time she asked me to I would tell her no, ""that\'s gay"". And then after some time I would give in and pretend I didn\'t like it. Then I would look at myself in the mirror and be happy I was so beautiful. I would identify secretly to myself as a girl, not simply as a feminine boy. I was so happy too with how much I looked like a girl! I didn\'t always feel like a girl growing up, though. Post-puberty I developed gynecomastia (swollen chest tissue) which I still have and I became conflicted about it-- because on one end of the spectrum I really hated it for making me look less like a man, but I also liked having breasts that I could play with and even lick my nipples (sorry). The thing is I don\'t always want to be a woman! Only sometimes (40% of the time) do I feel like I need to be one, and other times (40%) I want to be a man and 20% of the time I just don\'t give it a thought. Idk its kinda complicated for me to explain and I don\'t have all the language I would need in order to quite yet. Im still figuring a lot out.\n\nSo in high school, we did this thing where students would crossdress for spirit week (opposite day). At first I was reluctant to participate but my mom convinced me that everyone would be doing it so I decided why not. She gave me one of her multicolored dresses that I wore over a pink and navy blue striped polo and I put a necklace on. I loved how I looked in the mirror. In one of my classes the girls saw me and some other \'boys\' who were crossdressing for the day and offered to do our makeup. I said yes, and it was the first time I ever wore eyeliner and mascara and foundation. Although some people did judge, more or less everyone was supportive. I looked at myself at the end of the day in the bathroom mirror and thought ""wow I\'d be so pretty as a girl"". This trend of crossdressing and looking in the mirror would continue all the way until now. It was only recently that I really gave it any thought.\n\nI came out as bisexual to my mom and it didn\'t end well for me. The same process it took for me to realize I was bisexual I had for my realization I was genderfluid. At first I thought that me being attracted to men made me gay. The first time I came out to anyone as LGBT it was to my mom as gay, because I believed that you couldn\'t like multiple genders. But then I realized that sexuality is fluid and that I could be attracted to all genders! In regards to discovering my gender, I would be in the shower thinking about how much I want a vagina right now, and breasts and hips and a feminine face, and this would not be all of the time, so I made nothing out of it. Until one day I introspected and said to myself, ""hey you might be what you feared you were"". So I gave it some thought and gave legitimacy to that thought and soon it turned into a deep conviction.\n\nIt\'s difficult to explain, but at first, I chocked up me being attracted to men as me fulfilling that inner desire to be a woman.

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals transition into parenthood, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.",genderfluid,Harvard GNC Parent Study,1567806641.0,"{'created_utc': 1567781441, 'id': 'd0ho6b', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\n[Study Information:](https://i.redd.it/zell7woglzk31.jpg)\n\nThis is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents.

There are times I feel masculine and there are times I feel feminine, and depending on my mood I want to go all in one way or the other.

For the longest time I suppressed all my thoughts about my gender, instead only focusing on my sexuality which in its self was confusingly enough. But thanks to my wonderful partner showing me how my sexual preferences really dont matter to anyone but me, he helped me start focusing on even thinking about my gender. 

I'm AMAB (I think that's the correct term for biological male). I've always been generally extremely masculine in general public scenes, general a bit of an angry psycho through my teens, lots of martial arts, sports, breaking/blowing stuff up, always focused on working out trying to be bigger/stronger. I've always been slim and toned, and at 6'10"", very hairy with a full beard and big hands I've always had an imposing figure. I'm often somewhat emotionless, despite being an empath. I'm often described by my friends as a sociopath with an empath on switch. Not great at feeling my own emotions, but can feel others.

However I'm almost 23 now and over the last 6 months my partner has helped me see that a lot of more feminine things make me quite happy. Being able to be the hyper emotional and nurturing one, letting myself gain some fat to have some curves. We're only just started exploring any femininity in bed because that's where I'm very comfortable,  but I'm looking for something else.

I'm starting to crave a way to feel more feminine.  Have that extra level of self emotional feeling, that feeling of physical self awareness and vulnerability. Physically I know I wish I had breasts, sometimes other stuff, but that's difficult to work with and not really what I'm looking for at this moment.

One thing i do know is i dont like makeup, at least not things like lipstick or eyeshadow. It think heavily colored makeup is unnatural looking and i dont like it on anyone, especially not myself, and trust me, my man has already tried.

I'm also rather attached to my beard, at least for the next 8 months or so as I live in a very very cold place and the beard is a godsend on days with freezing rain or sub -10 nights. Maybe next summer I can experiment with no beard.

 But are there any other small things i could start with for exploring a feminine side?

It think heavily colored makeup is unnatural looking and i dont like it on anyone, especially not myself, and trust me, my man has already tried.\n\nI\'m also rather attached to my beard, at least for the next 8 months or so as I live in a very very cold place and the beard is a godsend on days with freezing rain or sub -10 nights. Maybe next summer I can experiment with no beard.\n\n But are there any other small things i could start with for exploring a feminine side?

I am genderfluid and pursuing my master’s degree in clinical mental health counseling (whoop whoop, represent!), and I just want to say, please be picky about your counselors/therapists you seek. Sometimes counselors get elevated to this level that what they say is right, they are fully informed and educated, etc. Being with my classmates, being out in every class for over a year now, and still being met with cissexism, I know not every counselor will be healthy for you. 

To bitch for a sec: It is so discouraging being misgendered by all of these people with cultural diversity training and an expressed desire to understand and accept others. It’s beyond my classmates, it’s my supervisors and professors, too. The ones that actually catch their language are a godsend, but most ignore my “please default to they pronouns for me until I tell you/you see my pronoun pin.” 

One day, I will be there for you. Together we can be a beautiful genderflood. Until then, please be cautious. Gender minority issues, as much as we are talking about it in my program (one of the top in the nation- which sucks in a way), is still so ingrained in a lot of my cisgender peers in ways that I know would be actively harmful if any of you were exposed to them. That’s really fucking scary, I know. So please be picky. 

If you are seeking therapy, please call the therapist first and drop some trans-language at them. If they don’t know even basic words for the transgender community, like passing, AFAB/AMAB (or any of its equivalents), then skip over them. It is not your job to educate them and get them caught up to speed. 

I had to educate my counselor about genderfluidity, but that was it. He understood passing, my difficulties in creating space for me in more masculine places, and how my experience of being AFAB compounds some of my rape fears especially when in guymode. When I sobbed to him how I’m so fucked when I graduate since I’m surrounded by people with cultural diversity training who continue to invalidate me, he went on this really sweet talk of how there will be a place for me and some people will seek me out *because* I’m genderfluid rather than *despite*. Like I totally forgot my identity isn’t a burden because that’s all it’s been treated as for a year. It was so sweet of him, and he meant every word.

Good counselors are out there. Some cisgender people will understand. But please please please walk into it with a discerning eye and a stern hand. You deserve good treatment. You don’t deserve bullshit.

My name is Louis Lindley and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

If you are interested, please visit [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous. 

If you have any questions or comments please email me at [llindl1@students.towson.edu](mailto:llindl1@students.towson.edu) or my advisor, Dr. M. Paz Galupo, at [pgalupo@towson.edu](mailto:pgalupo@towson.edu) 

**Transgender Research Informed Consent (TRICON) Disclosure Policy:**

**Objective:** The objective is to gain a better understanding of how gender expectations, gender dysphoria, and body satisfaction may or may not interact to impact levels of sexual satisfaction. The results of this study will help to inform clinicians who work with transgender clients to improve their sexual satisfaction.

**Primary Investigator:** The co-PI’s are Louis Lindley (graduate student at Towson University) and Annalisa Anzani (Doctoral Student at University of Milano – Bicocca) who are being supervised by Dr. M. Paz Galupo (professor at Towson University)

**Trans Involvement:** Louis Lindley is a queer transman. Due to the inclusion of questions about sexual activities; we sought the feedback and suggestions of other transgender researchers while creating the survey to ensure the survey was affirming and would not be unnecessarily triggering. 

**Sponsoring Institution/Funding:** This project is not funded nor are there any sponsoring institutions or organizations.

**Institutional Review Board:** The IRB at Towson University approved this study.

**Target population:** Any individual over the age of 18 who identifies as non-binary, transgender, or with a transgender history is asked to participate in this study. As always, we hope to have a diverse sample in terms of race and SES and will do targeted sampling if necessary, to insure we are not only reporting on the experiences of white, middle to upper class trans or non-binary individuals. While we include participants from all over the world, the survey is only available in English. 

**Compensation:** There is no cost to participant in the study nor are there any travel requirements. There is no compensation for participating in the study. 

**Accessing Results:** The result of this study will be published in a peer reviewed journal. While we cannot guarantee that the article will be open access, we will post an accessible link to Louis Lindley’s research gate once it is accepted and published.",genderfluid,participants needed for trans affirming research!,1568426943.0,"{'created_utc': 1568401743, 'id': 'd3u04z', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n![img](n07tj53xtem31)\n\nMy name is Louis Lindley and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.\n\nWe are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities.

My name is Louis Lindley (he/him) and I am queer transmasculine researcher with Towson University.

We are conducting a research study examining transgender and non-binary individuals’ engagement with sexual activities. We want to make sure that the literature on transgender sexual engagement is rooted in the actual lived experiences of transgender individuals and to do this we need your help. The survey will take between 20-30 minutes and will ask about your engagement with various sexual activities. 

If you are interested, please visit [**https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8**](https://tinyurl.com/yxj856n8)

Participation is completely voluntary, and your answers will remain anonymous.

152,2019-09-13 19:59:42,d3upo2,10,6,"Sorry if this offends anyone or I just look stupid, I'm new to all of this. So let's start by saying I'm 16 bi AMAB. Now everything was just peachy until I mentioned on a post that everytime I went on r/egg_irl it would freak me out. Then someone mentioned I might be an egg and now from a span of a few hours to a few days I freak out if I am trans or not. Now I looked up the official definition and symptoms of gender disphora and didn't show any of the signs (I don't really hate/disgusted by my genitals, ECT) so I don't really know if I could be trans, but I have noticed a couple things that freak me out. 
   
   First, I have always had an interest in people transforming from one gender to the other (I once looked up steroid side effects just to see guys with breast, once tried to see if my genitalia would shrink, watched a ""watch this and turn into a girl"" YouTube video), now this could also be because I have a TG fetish (I know it's terrible, I can't control it). I also thought sometimes that I was born female due to my hair and nails growing faster than anyone else's and my general body shape.

   Second, I have wondered what breast and a vagina would feel like/ feel like during sex. Don't know what this means really, though I have noticed that I don't like stuff touching my breast or people looking at them, whether that means something or if I just have sensitive nipples and shyness.

   Third, I have sometimes pictured myself as a girl, most of the time it just happens during day dreams of sex and what not. It stays somewhat consistent.

   Fourth, I sometimes hate my voice. I have a naturally higher voice for a male and sometimes I hate it for being too low, and sometimes for being too high. This usually starts the thought loops of me worrying about being trans for the rest of the day.

Now thing against me being trans is that 

A. I don't mind being male, my name, people seeing me as male, using the male bathroom, ECT

B. I don't particularly want to be female forever and onwards. If I had to pick, I would just want to be able to shift back and forward at will(I know this sounds really obvious, just hold on)

C. I don't really care for more femme stuff (ie makeup, dresses, long hair, ECT). If I had to be female, I would want to be punk masc (shortish hair like [this](https://photos.app.goo.gl/56ha6uuiWeoC8qro8), tank tops, t-shirts, boots, jeans, ECT) So I don't know if that disqualifys me or not.

In August, I went to my first pride festival (it was okay) after freaking out for a while for being there, I talk to this lovely enby person at one of the booths from which I was able to talk to about a lot of stuff I was keeping in, one of which being gender. She mentioned that I could be genderfluid, which after looking it up some more seems interesting and close to me but I'm not sure I am one. I don't know what other genderfluid people deal with (like I noticed many use they/them pronouns, I don't care if I get called he/him. Though I have accepted that it's a possibility that I am as of recently. The lovely enby at the festival mentioned the ""Starbucks test"" which I am nowhere near brave enough to do, but it did get me thinking about if I was female what would my name be, from which I believe Elizabeth or Beth for short is pretty good.

155,2019-09-14 01:26:56,d3ysnt,2,1,"Hello fluid friends,

I'm starting T soon (hopefully), and I am full of hopes and worries and hours of overthinking, so I've decided to share a little here just to get it all out. And maybe even to help other people feel a little less alone in this process if anyone out there is going through something similar. 

I'm AFAB and I identify genderqueer/genderfluid (pronouns: they/them). I tend to shift around between feeling femme male, gay male, butch female, hyperfemme, transmasculine, genderless, and blob (I made that one up), but my body is so feminine that I don't feel like I can express my particular brand of boyishness and/or genderlessness without being misinterpreted as simply female. Binders have helped a lot, but I also really really want broader shoulders and a sharper jawline and less of a waist and darker leg hair, so I've been working on getting T. It's been stressful. I had my first appointment with a doctor this week, and I was so worried the whole time that I was going to say the wrong thing and be disqualified. But it went ok! And I have an appointment next week to go over my hormone level tests and hopefully proceed with the stabby stabby part. 

I'm super excited to think that my body is going to start growing into something more reflective of who I am and how I feel. I am also scared, honestly. The whole stabbing myself with a needle thing seems horrible. I'm also a worried about facial hair too since on my hyperfemme days I think that I wouldn't really want it. I guess that's what razors are for though, and honestly I'm pretty excited for just the ritual of shaving my face--such a masculine practice in my book. I'm most scared of the acne. My skin isn't amazing now, and the idea of adding more does freak me out. Not pumped for it.

I've also been reading into these fears in a very self-doubtful way, which has taken a while to get over. I've finally realized that I'm allowed to be a bit scared (after all medical stuff is inherently terrifying) and even a little sad to say goodbye to my old body and old self. After all, my old self did carry me through much of my life and I am very grateful for that. 

This whole process has been full of paradoxes, really. Like I worry that people I find attractive won't find me attractive after I transition, but at the same time I definitely don't feel attractive having to hide my body to be myself. I love showing off my body, and I can't wait to show off a body that is correct for my identity. I worry about becoming angrier because I don't want to be an angry person, but also I often find myself wishing I could be more aggressive when I need to be (e.g. not taking any sh*t about my pronouns). I worry that binary-minded people might start mistaking me for a man, which would not be cool, but also I know that being mistaken for a woman continues to be a very uncool thing in my life. 

There is so much to this--so much muchness. It's overwhelming in the same way that walking alone in a forest at night is overwhelming. It's overwhelming in the same way that jumping into icy water in overwhelming. It is so much. 

But I guess that all these strong and shifting emotions are very on brand for my genderfluid experience and identity. When my entire identity is constantly metamorphosing and brimming to be free, why shouldn't my emotions do the same? 

Anyway, I'd love to hear if anyone else has similar feelings about their transition process or other non-similar feelings about it. One of my favorite things about this community is each of our undying commitments to being true to ourselves and embracing this beautiful crazy mind-blowing experience in our own ways. 

Much love,

My sisters are Pan and Gay. One of my sisters goes by male. My sisters roommates are Gender fluid. My many friends have changed genders or have identified as something else. 

my issue is, I feel like I offend them when I mess up, or slip. I love them all VERY much but I get so confused on who they like or what they go by. I'm afraid to ask questions because I dont know what is offensive. How can I understand what is offensive if I don't understand how they feel? Maybe once I understand more about everything maybe it will help me not slip up as much? 

I'm VERY VERY new to this entire thing. I get the being with who you want. You love who you love. But maybe what I'm not understanding is the gender part? I have always understood it as Gender is literally your genitalia but I know I'm incorrect. 


Where can I start? What do I even ask to start understanding? I feel like this will just be more common in my life with my loved ones but I'm so behind on everything.

Also I work 75 hours a week so I can't just watch videos like I'd like to (I could listen though while I'm working so maybe recommend videos that would help?)

I am Gender Fluid (AFAB) and I have been for an extremely long time but didn't exactly figure it out until the last few years. At one point I thought I was a trans male and took testosterone for a couple of years until, even when I suspected I was Gender Fluid. I stopped because I just didn't enjoy comments my family and associates were saying. I felt happy when I looked masculine. 

That is what my main issue is. I wish I was born male, I want a flat chest, I want to have a different set of downstairs equipment, and I want smaller hips. I wish I was taller and my voice was deeper. 

I still feel like a girl sometimes I think and I'm pretty sure I'm Gender Fluid but I feel like if I suddenly switched sexes I'd probably cry from happiness. 

Is this normal? That I would have a cis male body and still be gender fluid? Is something wrong with me? I can't tell anymore. I don't even know if I can my girlfriend (she is a trans woman btw) the extent of this. I have a hard time having sex with her now despite really really wanting to because I hate being the one on the receiving end and I want her to be the one receiving end and I don't have the necessary equipment to do it.

Hi, I'm a 27yo AFAB person, been identifying as genderfluid for the past 6 years or so. In these years, I've sometimes wondered whether I was maybe a man instead of a genderfluid person, but then usually concluded that that was probably not the case, for whatever reason. I usually dress rather femme, disphoria goes up and down but lately the need to not have a chest has been high so I finally bit the bullet and ordered a binder. It arrived yesterday, and it fits great. Yay!

Now, I'm bi/pan and polyamorous, so been dating a few people and they're all super supportive. There's a cis guy I've been seeing for about 6 months, and he's not great in expressing his thoughts and feelings so he didn't say much about it, I think he's probably adjusting to things as he's only dated cis women before. We had a nice evening and then got frisky, and though I usually never have an issue with this, suddenly penetration felt weird. Even with fingers. The physical sensation was nice, but somehow it felt... off. Even though before yesterday, I've absolutely loved it most of the time.

I'm pretty darn confused about this. I'm unsure about what this 'means'.

I usually dress rather femme, disphoria goes up and down but lately the need to not have a chest has been high so I finally bit the bullet and ordered a binder. It arrived yesterday, and it fits great. Yay!\n\nNow, I'm bi/pan and polyamorous, so been dating a few people and they're all super supportive. There's a cis guy I've been seeing for about 6 months, and he's not great in expressing his thoughts and feelings so he didn't say much about it, I think he's probably adjusting to things as he's only dated cis women before. We had a nice evening and then got frisky, and though I usually never have an issue with this, suddenly penetration felt weird. Even with fingers. The physical sensation was nice, but somehow it felt... off. Even though before yesterday, I've absolutely loved it most of the time.\n\nI'm pretty darn confused about this.

225,2019-09-19 09:54:34,d6bskt,4,2,"Hey! I could really use some support right now. Not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I didn't know a better place to post, since I have never explored non-binary communities and I'm not sure if this kind of a thing would be welcome in trans male spaces. I know it's kind a longish post, but if you'd take the time to read it, I'd be very grateful.

So, I used to think I was a binary trans man. Always had a masculine way of dressing, intense dysphoria about any of my feminine features, ecstatic when someone referred to me with male pronouns, the whole works. One of those boring ""knew since I was 6 years old"" types. (Though I did have a girly phase in my teens, and later took an interest in drag.) I've always supported non-binary identities, but it used to make me wildly uncomfortable when people referred to me personally with terms like ""transmasculine"" instead of just ""a man.""

I came out about a year ago so I could start the transition process (which is kind of long and tedious in my country) and didn't look back. My feelings were only those of happiness and relief. I finally felt like my life was mine, that I really existed.

Then, yesterday, something weird and wholly unexpected happened. As I was idly scrolling through a totally unrelated gaming subreddit, I saw a silly comic about a girl that I related to. No biggie, people can relate to other genders, happens all the time. Except that upon closer inspection, I noticed that my dysphoria was gone. More than that, I felt like a woman. That is to say, the thought of others seeing me as a woman no longer made me hurt, sad or angry.

It all came out of NOWHERE. I just stared at the screen frozen for like 5 minutes and then said ""Well, shit,"" to myself, because what else was I supposed to do? I've gone through a year of intense interrogation about my identity without ever doubting myself, and am almost at the point where I can finally get on testosterone. I've been daydreaming about transitioning for forever. And now, suddenly, I'm sitting here, feeling like one of the girls.

I mean, this might be great news, if I knew it would last. No more dysphoria, no painful misgendering, no need to come out to people etc. Transitioning is NOT easy. But if this all happened so suddenly, how was I to know things wouldn't go back to the way they were just as quickly?

I was obviously distraught, and my girlfriend soon noticed something was up. I was reluctant to tell her at first, but these feelings kept getting more intense. By the end of the night, I was actually SCARED of testosterone making me seem so masculine that I'd never be able to pass as a woman again — a thing I used to want more than anything. The identity crisis escalated into a full meltdown. My girlfriend did her best to comfort me, but I could tell she was caught off-guard as well.

Not being able to do anything else, I bawled for the rest of the night, and then reluctantly came into the conclusion that I might be bigender or genderfluid. My girlfriend said she loves me no matter my gender, and I obviously love her, so all is well on that front, even if she is still confused, and understandably worried.

I eventually managed to get some sleep, and woke up feeling almost back to normal. 

The biggest problem about all this is that my country doesn't acknowledge non-binary identities. You can get a diagnosis, but as I understand it, only binary trans people are allowed to transition at all. One of the reasons I've passed through the process in only a year is because I used to be such a ""textbook case."" If 99% of me wants testosterone, that might still not be enough if 1% doesn't.

All our local trans resources recommend seeking a binary trans diagnosis if you want access to treatment, even if that isn't what best describes you, so I think that's what I'll do. I don't want to make it harder for future me to get testosterone because of how I felt on one single evening.

But, seriously, what am I supposed to do now? Am I even allowed to call myself a ""trans man"" anymore?

247,2019-09-21 22:00:51,d7h1yh,3,5,"I’m still new to Gender Identity as a theory and I’m curious as to whether one’s gender can be said to exist outside of thought. 

Here’s an example: a couple who looks like Peter Coffin and his wife live in the woods, we see them have sex and it reveals the former to have male anatomy and the latter to have female, but nobody is around to address them in the third person, so pronouns never come up. We know one is identified as non-binary but don’t know which. Is there anyway to refer to this couple if pronouns don’t come up—ie can we say this is a man and a woman?

307,2019-09-26 01:20:24,d9cn59,0,2,"i've lived in a state of semi-outness for about a year now. my spouse, a handful of close friends, and a handful more of extended friends have heard it from my own mouth that i identify as genderfluid and am not participating in the binary.

i haven't found the words or the moment to do any sort of formal ""announcement"" of coming out. i made a call to go more with a ""soft-launch"" wherein i just start walking the walk. part of it is because i left most of social media due to anxiety and not sure what platform such an announcement would even go on. and part of it, i regret, is that i'm a little afraid of what it would look like to have to publicly defend/explain/justify/rationalize myself for it. a year later though, i'm starting to feel like i owe it to myself and to the people in my life to offer a clearer explanation of what's going on with me.

it seems like genderfluid is a particularly complicated identity to have to explain. it feels SO much to do with my own intuition! when do i ""feel like a girl"" or ""feel like a boy""? i just answer that question day by day by using highly circumstantial and intuitive and frankly subjective self-analyses. by really considering how i feel and logging it, looking for patterns, pushed the extremes a little, i've definitely been able to ride my gender swings more consciously by adapting my outward presentation to match the intuitive inner feelings that fluctuate along the masc/fem spectrum, and importantly, find a more androgynous baseline of presentation that does wonders in mitigating dysphoria.

but i get hung up here: if the gender binary is all a construct that ought to be dismantled in favor of a continuum with infinite hues, it sure feels like even by having a ""girl day"" or a ""boy day"" and considering three sets of rolling pronouns depending on my intuition feels really subservient to the gender binary in which i profess to eschew participation. because i sort of *am* still participating in a certain kind of binary based on the notion that it's culturally understood that getting a cute manicure (etc) is feminine and getting your muscles jacked at the gym (etc) is masculine. there are also even less tangible things like capacities of empathy or creativity, pushes for power or competitiveness, that have gendered histories. like, the social construct of gender *itself* feels so entrenched in the binary!

so i guess, my concern is that i'm not sure i can offer a completely contradiction free explanation of my gender, or an explanation that doesn't account heavily on my own circumstantial intuition. and i've felt like if i can't offer that, i shouldn't come out because *what if i'm wrong and my intuition is leading me astray or i'm misreading all the cues and ""true"" identity is something else and i just don't realize it right now* – thoughts like this that sow doubt in my own sense of judgement.

i know realistically i probably won't be interrogated by some gender prosecutor, but at the same time i do feel like i want to fully understand the ""system"" of how this all works and it bothers me that i don't. i just feel and react, same way i do art.

319,2019-09-26 17:23:42,d9mscp,0,2,"Hello, r/genderfluid!

For my undergraduate senior exhibition project, I am compiling a series of comic book issues focused on LGBTQA themes. I am creating a comic book issue about stories for each major letter of the LGBTQA acronym and want to include a more diverse selection of stories from primary sources rather than hunting around for accounts written by journalists and authors. I have chosen to survey Reddit for research because I have done it multiple times in the past and feel the platform is great for reaching a wide and diverse audience.

**Who am I?**

I am a queer person who is interested in portraying queer stories that often get overlooked in media. I am also a comic book fanatic and an illustration nut who wants to stretch my wings and use comics as a medium to portray these stories.

**Why survey?**

While I am a Queer person, I am not a gay man, I am not a queer person of color, I am not Asexual, and it would be unfair/ego-driven/gross to assume I can accurately portray these perspectives. The goal is to show off personal queer experiences and what is the point if I disingenuously write a perspective I do not understand?

The stories can be as short as you want, even just 2-3 sentences, and yours may be adapted into a short 2-3 page comic in one of my comic books.

**I will not be profiting off of this work but you might help me get a job! :\^)**

THE SURVEY WILL CLOSE ON OCTOBER 8TH AT 11:00 PM CDT

Here is the link to the survey
