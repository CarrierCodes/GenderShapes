So, here‚Äôs the deal. I‚Äôm AFAB. I‚Äôm NB. I‚Äôve felt this for years and although fully recognising it recently had put so much clarity into my life, it‚Äôs introduced a new type of suffering. I hate my body because it is impossible for me personally to feel androgynous with it. I have a massive hip to waist ratio (IE tiny hips, curvy waist). I have a flat-ish stomach. I have a massive butt. Like, kardashian level. I honestly hate it though. I feel terrible because I know there are women out there who spend their entire waking lives dieting, self-harming and exercising to get a body similar to mine. And here‚Äôs me feeling down because I‚Äôve got it and I don‚Äôt want it. The guilt in that is insane. I can‚Äôt even be grateful that I meet current western beauty standards that are somewhat able to give me privilege. I would trade it for a less curvy body in a second if there was a way. Because of my bum and thighs, I can‚Äôt fit into clothing made for males such as chinos and shirts. I can‚Äôt even fit into female trousers unless they‚Äôre a curvy petite range. The dysohoria that comes with this is KILLING me. I never look how I want because of my boobs, and even if I got a binder, my butt curves out and my thighs are very feminine and I just know that wearing gender neutral clothing and not looking androgynous is going to be worse than gender dysphoria. I had an eating disorder for about 8 years and I‚Äôm recovery now - but I recently realised that so much of it was spurred by subconsciously wanting to lose weight to ‚Äòappear‚Äô more ‚Äòandrogynous‚Äô.


I rarely feel like myself when wearing a tight dress, but it fits an aesthetic and I get compliments (and therefore, validation) and I enjoy that aspect. But I‚Äôm done with dressing just to suit my female body type. I need to unpack my own thoughts and ideals that make me believe androgyny = only attainable with a gender-obscure body, but also I think I need to try and reduce how feminine my body looks because even being naked looks horrible to me.

27,2019-07-01 17:39:29,c7wjv7,8,15,"I'm 22 years old and I have identified as NB since I was about 16-17. I have only openly told 1 person,and that's my cousin who is also probably my only friend as well. My family is extremely homophobic,and even more so transphobic. Not in the ""we hate gays! Abominations!"" type way,but in a ""we will pretend to like them and support them to their faces while we privately laugh and mock or question and deny their existence in private"" type of homophobic/transphobic.

I don't feel accepted or even valued in my family. There is no other queer person in my family that could give tips or guidance,so i had to walk the path alone in my childhood.  I stopped going by Savana (my birthname) and started going by Eli (part of middle name). When people online call me Eli,I feel such an enpowering and happy feeling in my heart. I never told my family that I would prefer to be called Eli,I give them subtle hints here and there...that they never catch onto.

I feel more at peace when people mistake me for a boy and call me ""young man,sir,boy,he"" etc, because it makes me feel like I successfully broke the binary. Like I can be seen as either,both,or all,by people...and it the feeling goes away when my family goes out of their way to ""correct"" the person.

So, obviously I haven't come out to my parents as nb and I'm a little worried.

Honestly I think my mother would be mostly confused but it's my father I'm worried about. To explain why involves my (attempted) coming out to him as asexual.

So this was years ago and I decided to come out as asexual to avoid all the ""interested in anyone?""  question which were pretty frequent. But because it's asexuality of course you have to explain the concept before you explain that ""I am this"". Which I think would be the same case for my parents with nb. But anyway, it didn't go well. After the explanation he kinda laughed derisively and said ""that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of"". It felt kind of like ""I could hate these people, but I honestly don't think they're worth my time"" so I didn't come out.

I'm worried this scenario will repeat itself when I try and come out as nb. Or worse. 

The thing is I do want to come out to them. We're really close and we live in the same city so see each other 2-3 times a month and we talk almost constantly. And when I see them I feel like I can't bind or wear clothes I'm really comfortable in.

I know I don't want HRT. I just want to be infertile and never menstruate. Carrying a growing child in a womb seems like something my body by all means should NOT be capable of.

I'm alright with holding off on seeking tubal litigation for now, because maybe there's a chance this feeling goes away once I'm out of my 20s. For now I just need to stop menstruating so I can feel normal, and not like a woman or a future mother.

I've done research and it's been shown that medically suppressing menstuation has the same side effect risks as traditional birth control (where a person does continue to menstuate).

I've reached out to my local LGBTQ center and they provided a list of some local trans-affirming doctors that will take my insurance.

I'm worried that telling a doctor that I'm trans would mean that I'd be expected to accquire a psychiatry note before achieving a prescription. I'm worried that a doctor might pressure me into considering HRT because they don't believe in nonbinary genders and they'd mistake me for a binary transgender person.

I'm worried that not telling a doctor anything about gender dsyphoria would mean my request for menstual suppression would be denied. I'm worried that identifying as nonbinary to a doctor would mean my request is denied, because the doctor might not believe nonbinary genders are real, or at least not as serious as being binary transgender.

tl;dr

Should I identify myself to a new doctor as transgender, nonbinary, or cisgender in order to achieve a prescription to medically suppress menstruation?

I remember thinking I was nonbinary before I even had the language to describe that. If I knew about they/them pronouns and whatnot at a young age, I think I would have done that in a heartbeat. I remember standing outside some gendered restrooms and wondering why there wasn't a third option as a little kid back in 2002 at the age of 4 and then my mom ushering me to go into the women's restroom. I found some school curriculum from an IEP I had in elementary with the teachers noticing that I didn't know I was a girl and they had to teach me that I was one. I developed chest dysphoria when I hit puberty and have been basically wearing sports bras since then because normal bras are very dysphoria inducing. I would watch Trans men transition videos and I never cared about them looking more masculine or anything but would get jealous at their top surgery and the scars they'd have and think I'd rather have top surgery scars and a flat chest than the flesh weights I carry.... 

But for a while because of my chest dysphoria I assumed I was a transgender man, but my mom found out after telling a friend about it via passing notes and she got really upset and over time I realized I didn't want to be a man because I was gendered as ""he"" once and it felt gross to me, but when a professor a few years later addressed me as ""they"" I felt euphoria. 

I have long hair and I hate it. It makes me so inmistakably female. I wish I can cut it, but I'm scared if I cut it exactly how I want to it means cracking the egg. My transfemme partner bought me a binder for our anniversary and I really liked it but she got me one size too small on accident so it wasn't the best to wear in the world but I really want to try binding again if I can go one size up... 

I know this is very rambly and probably doesn't make a lot of sense. It's just hard when the cis don't understand you, but binary trans people frequently invalidate your existence.

Hello all. I recently came out as Agender and so far I have had mild struggles, mostly with dysphoria and being misgendered. But yesterday I hit a new problem: I wished with all my being that I could stop being trans and just be cis. 
Some background- I have been goth for a long time but my clothing style has changed from overly sexualized femme clothing to more neutral band t-shirts and black jeans. Also I am married and my partner is cis but is extremely supportive of my transition. That being said, a comment he made to me yesterday has me in full panic mode and I am not sure why. All he said was that sometimes he felt guilty for still finding himself attracted to more femme presenting goth people. And there is nothing wrong with him being attracted to that style. And he said he still thinks I am very attractive. But I just wanted to die when I heard that. I wish so much that I could put on a short skirt again and just feel comfortable. I want to be the sexiest person I can be for him but I feel like I never will be with my more neutral style. Has anyone else had this issue? What do I do to feel better? At this moment it makes me feel so bad that I just want to jump back in the closet and go back to being miserable in my own skin...",NonBinary,Struggling,1562101023.0,"{'created_utc': 1562075823, 'id': 'c89j1o', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'CW: dysphoria, triggering thoughts/comments\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nHello all.

I just came out to myself in March and started buying clothes on the ""other side of the stores"". Not long after I find my self in the position to be able to backpack the world for an extended period of time.

Has anyone here backpacked through Asia, Oceania, Africa, Europe, south America while fem or Non-binary? What items do you recommmend me to bring? I'll try to go off the beaten path. Ill be away between 6 months and a year.

Backpacking presents challenges, opportunities and harsh realizations as Non-binary

Facts:
I'll be backpacking: I need to travel super light.
I'll visit many countries and regions: I'll face different cultures and acceptance towards a feminine ""guy"" (my presentation is androgynousfem but voice and mannerisms mostly masc).

Choosing what I'll take will be a challenge as I need to balance not taking much but feeling cute but prepared when passing by through an homophobic culture. A Chinese person told me that therem I'll have the ""immunity"" of a foreigner. I'm not as sure about small town China or Rusia or some African countries or south america, for example.

An awesome realization is that my fem clothes use way less space (tiny panties, short shortsm tight jeans, tight t-shirts, ankle socks). However, the clothes won't be as cute as I like them: nonglitery things and i may need to add some ""unisex"" items.

I've bought some cute shoes... they'll stay behind :(
I won't bring dresses or skirts :(
I won't bring make up: mostly the space and weight :(

Are you a sucker for romance? Are you nonbinary (or just struggling with gender in general)? This book hits those two automatically.

Blurb:

It's just three words: I am nonbinary. But that's all it take to change everything.

When Ben De Backer comes out to their parents, they're thrown out of their house and forced to move in with their estranged older sister, Hannah, and her husband, Thomas, whom Ben has never even met. Struggling with an anxiety disorder compounded by their parents' rejection, they come out only to Hannah, Thomas, and their therapist, and try to keep a low profile in a new school.

But Ben's attempts to survive the last half of senior year unnoticed are thwarted by when Nathan Allan, a funny and charismatic student, decides to take Ben under his wings. As Ben and Nathan's friendship grows, their feelings begin to change, and what started as a disastrous turn of events looks like it might just be a chance to start a happier, new life.

Representation:

MC and their best friend are nonbinary

Love interest is bisexual, as well as a POC

I'm gonna paste my Goodreads review here for your reading pleasure - TL;DR is at the top.

~~~


TL;DR: Every person struggling with their gender needs this book. Bottom line, cut and dry. Also, trigger warning if you're reading this: this book can get very intense at certain points. Like, anxiety levels of intense. It only happens about twice or thrice, and they occur mostly toward the end, but I'd proceed with caution. Even I had to put the book down and take a moment to process them. There's also unsupportive parents, misgendering, and brief implications of body dysphoria.

""'Whatever happens,' his grip tightens a little, 'I wish you all the best, Benjamin De Backer.' He says it with a smile. 'You deserve it'."" - pg. 208, and a quote I might paraphrase and get tattooed on me, or at least framed. This quote made me cry on and off for a good ten minutes, because it just kinda hit me. I don't have the words to explain why, but it just... let's just say I've never happy-cried, much less for a book. I've always heard of crying from relating too hard to a book, but Deaver's the first person to actually make me feel it. And for that, I thank you.

BUT on to the review. 

But seriously, this book is amazing! I think this is the first book I've ever given a 5-star review for. I'm normally not someone who likes giving ""abolutes"". I typically settle for 4-stars. Which is odd, because I'm a fantasy person. I like fantasy and adventure. When I pre-ordered this book, seeing that it was an interracial NBLM (nonbinary loving male) relationship, I was hooked. Yet, I still had doubts on whether I'd complete the whole thing or not.

I understand why people may have gotten frustrated at Ben's constant self-doubt, as well as the natural lulls in conversation. But personally, I feel like it made their character more relatable. Maybe that's the issue I've been having with other books I read: the conversations sound too formal, especially when it's out of character. I could actually relate to Ben, and this is coming from a person of color. The repetitiveness, the constant ""What if I'm fucking this up"" even where there's no obvious reason they should - describes me to a T, even with mundane situations.

I believe the only thing that could give is if someone is nit-picky with grammar and punctuation issues. Especially in the first half, where run-ons were rampant. There were a few misspellings, a few instances of where the author neglected quotations. But it didn't make the book awful. I'd say it like this (and correct me if I'm wrong on this quote): You can have a good story with bad graphics, but you can't have a bad story with good graphics. It's the best analogy I could come up with.


Plot-wise, I really enjoyed reading. There were days I wanted to just keep going, but reader's fatigue would mean that I got nothing out of it. Sometimes the time-skips could be a little out of proportion, or I had a hard time tracking what day it was, but again, did not distract from the reading.

Now, a therapy scene. One that seems kinda controversial in the Goodreads review page of this book, involving the conflation of ace/aro individuals with touch aversion. While I don't agree with it, I also don't agree with the reviews shaming it. Maybe it's because I'm seeing a therapist who isn't 100% knowledgeable on things (when I expressed my gender-nonconformity in terms of clothing style, she conflated it with ""genderfluidity""). But I don't think Deaver should be blamed for such. While it could be annoying to read, I think the therapist being ignorant in that sense was realistic.

I could ramble on and on, but I'd end up entering spoiler territory. All I have to say is this: if you're nonbinary, no matter the color of your skin, you need to read this. I nearly cried when the romance reached its head (after many bouts of secondhand embarrassment, of course) because it was done so beautifully. It makes me feel... hopeful, in a way. That maybe I'll find someone like Nathan.

I'm nonbinary and transmasculine. I've been using they/them pronouns exclusively for over a year and wearing mostly masc clothes + a binder for almost that long. I recently started taking low-dose T and I'm really loving it so far. 

My mom is bi and an artist so she basically lives in the queer community. I grew up with queer and trans babysitters and family friends and relatives - seriously, I have more queer family than straight family on mom's side - so I'd hoped that she'd be more accepting, even though she could never get my trans bff's pronouns right. 

When I came out to her about my pronouns it took her a long time to take me seriously and there were a lot of arguments. She's never identified as particularly feminine, so she sort of sees womanhood as a cross she has to bear in order to fight for the cause of feminism. So me transitioning is like abandoning womanhood for her. She did eventually come around and has been really supportive of me being nonbinary - buying me they/them pronoun pins, telling our family friends and relatives, etc. She still struggles with the pronouns but I think she's trying. 

HRT has always been a line for her though. Whenever I brought up the idea of it she would suggest that it would make me gain weight (and she has a LOT of internalized fatphobia) or aggressive/violent or unable to have children. None of this is true, but she ofc doesn't believe me when I tell her that.

Anyways, I started T while she was out of the country and I've struggled with telling her, but my voice is going to drop soon so I bit the bullet yesterday. All she said was ""oh well."" and got really quiet. It's pretty clear from the way she reacted that she's disappointed. I think she was okay with me being nonbinary as long as she could think of it as like ... some sort of feminist ""redefining womanhood"" type of move, like drag or something. But that's hard to justify now that I'm taking T, so we're back to me abandoning the cause of feminism to play for the other team. :|

Dislikes revealing gender/sex online  

Dislikes revealing sexuality/partner as it outs my gender/sex  

Feels that my assigned gender is a performance for others  

Has subconsciously gravitated towards dressing more androgynous over time  

Now consciously dresses more androgynous  

Still doesn't see self as a crossdresser   

Allows others to assume pronouns but has no idea how I would answer if asked my preferred pronouns  

Would be utterly cool with waking up as the opposite sex  

Would be cool with a lot of the results of transition  

Relates to a lot of NB/trans content  

Feels that my appearance is in some way permanently preventing me from growing up no matter what I do  

Can see early crushes as versions of what I might have looked like or wanted to look like/act like as the opposite sex  

Has never felt very attached to a gender conforming character of my sex no matter how much I liked or admired them   

Romanticises the transition of others and a hypothetical transition of an alternate me even though I know it's a long terrifying and difficult process in real life that no one wishes to have to go through  

Plans to change my name anyway  

Enjoys the most androgynous aspects of my physique despite them hindering my performance of my assigned gender  

Doesn't want to try harder to perform my assigned gender successfully even though photo evidence suggests it is possible for me to pull off and others like it 

Feels that others are more attached to my assigned gender than I am

Can't really imagine growing up into an older version of my assigned gender 

Also me:

Allows others to assume my gender and pronouns and isn't especially bothered by them 

Pretty chill with/indifferent to my social role, don't really think I would fit in any better overall with the opposite sex  

Doesn't experience gender dysphoria by any typical 'valid' description

Not that fussed about my body

Doesn't really plan to transition no matter how much I like the thought experiment sometimes

Doubts those people saying I'm probably trans 

Doubts those saying I'm cis

Knows transition wouldn't fix my self hatred because at the end of the day it's only gender and I've got bigger problems

Sometimes kinda wishes I'd personally never discovered trans or NB content even though I'm glad it exists for others

Makes posts like this even though it doesn't change anything and probably isn't productive

I'm feeling super love-y but I'm also just really happy that after all these years I've found a term that fits what I've always felt and there's a stellar community to back me up. 

So. Story time. Today at the grocery store I (AFAB enby) was waiting in line. I'm dressed rather femme, as I sometimes do, and I'm mega busty so like...I understand why people gender me as female. They probably always will. (Not on T; no desire to and researching more on breast reduction). 

The other cashier was calling, ""ma'am I'm open here"" and I was *completely* oblivious that they were talking to me. 

They obviously were trying to be polite so I chose not to correct them. But I would have preferred even a ""miss"" over the dreaded ""ma'am"". This cashier was a middle-aged person but I'm not gunna make that an excuse for them. I live in a pretty liberal, progressive area so most people have heard of certain terms even if they don't use them or understand fully. 

This particular grocery store...well, I used to work for the company. We were told to try to not use ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" for people. But I understand too, it can be difficult to get someone's attention when you are unfamiliar with them. 

Now I feel like I should have spoken up. Maybe the cashier could have said, ""excuse me, you in the black striped shirt"" or something. Or even saying ""excuse me sir or miss?"" 

Would you have said something? Don't you think it would better the community as a whole if we all started to very gently correct people and ask them to use other descriptors? 

I can't help feeling like I let you all down. I've chosen to be a part of this community and I should be fighting for our rights and visibility. If we stay silent...well...nothing will come of that. If we walk away from a scenario like that, we're not helping the situation and I hate it when I read people's stories of being misgendered and it ruining their day.

TL;DR at end of post

This is a thing that happened to me about 4 years ago now. I think it‚Äôs a pretty funny story, so why not post it here? Just for context, all of this happened before I identified as LGBT+, but I knew the terms and was supportive of the community. I was also born female (becomes relevant later).  

There was this girl who used to live in my neighborhood, and she and my sister were in the same grade, so naturally they became good friends (our moms became friends too). I‚Äôm a year above the both of them, so while not particularly close, I still hung out with the girl. I never really liked her, but because she lived really close and my mom was friends with the girl‚Äôs mom, I was forced to hang out with her a lot. 
The girl and I got into arguments a lot (mainly because we were both stubborn little brats). The girl also grew up in a very Christian home. Her dad played piano in the church band and once they took my sister and I to an anti-abortion rally. Naturally, this girl is now very homophobic and transphobic due to her upbringing. (Example: she loves Panic! At The Disco, but refuses to listen to Girls/Girls/Boys because it‚Äôs pro-LGBT+.)
Anyways, one day my sister and I were over at her house playing a tabletop game called ‚ÄúThe Game of Life.‚Äù The girl, my sister, the girl‚Äôs brother, and I were playing. (Explication of game at the end of this post!) The game pieces are shaped like tiny cars and they have slots for you to place blue or pink pegs in. The pegs are colored that way because they‚Äôre supposed to represent the genders of who is in the car, however, the colors of the pegs are more of a novelty, and don‚Äôt impact the game at all. 
To start, everyone has to put a peg in their car that represents them. Ever since the age of 7, I‚Äôve had issues with the color pink, so I put a blue peg in the car. When the girl realized what I had done she began screaming at me, saying that I was playing the game wrong, and I had to be pink because I was a girl. She claimed that I would forever be known as transgender in that game because I didn‚Äôt like pink. (Btw, my sister and the girl‚Äôs brother didn‚Äôt care what color I was, they just wanted to play.) I don‚Äôt remember if I changed colors or not, I just remember being both very angry and confused. I wanted to get back at her, but her brother beat me to it.

The girl‚Äôs brother is about three or four years younger than her (five or six younger than me), and they can‚Äôt get along with each other for more than an hour. Therefore, our mutual hatred for the girl meant that her brother and I are good friends despite the huge age gap. 

Anyways, back to the game.
There are some events in The Game of Life that you can‚Äôt skip over, and one of them is getting married. To get back at the girl for yelling at me, her brother (who was in second grade at the time), placed a second blue peg in his car, claiming that he was in a gay relationship. This made the girl frecking explode. She ran to her mom to tattle that her brother married a guy in the board game. Her mom was just annoyed by the girl‚Äôs behavior though and brushed it off. 

To my knowledge, the brother never got in trouble for doing that, and I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt. 

This memory still brings me joy for two reasons:
1) A homophobe called me out for being trans, long before I knew I was.
2) A homophobic, transphobic, most-likely-to-become-a-Karen, girl got got by a second grader who just barely knew what bearing gay meant. 


What is this game I mentioned:
For those of you who don‚Äôt know what The Game of Life is, you spin a spinner to move forward; the goal is to get to a retirement home and have as much money as possible. You land on various life events (such as a tree falling on your house, having a child, getting married, etc.). Some events force you to pay or earn money, but you also have to pay bills and can even invest in the stock market. Also some events like getting married are unskipable. Overall though, it‚Äôs a pretty fun family game. 

TL;DR
I chose to be a blue game piece instead of a pink one, and this girl flips out. Her younger brother then got gay married in the game in order to get back at her.

420,2019-07-08 19:49:20,capy3n,13,5,"I've been thinking about what the gender binary is, because I think there's actually two ways of thinking about it that I haven't seen addressed as two separate ideas. 

The first way is the traditional gender binary that is composed of two opposite mutually exclusive categories that are defined by each other. I think of this as the man/woman binary. Like a light switch that can be on or off with no inbetween. I think it's clear to us that this doesn't represent how gender operates in people's lives and that this needs to be dismantled. 

The second way I see the binary is as two opposite groups that are defined by each other, but aren't mutually exclusive. I think of this as a masculine/feminine binary. Instead of the light switch which has on and off, I think about it as an attribute like something being hot or cold where something can be hot, but not hot in comparison to say the sun.  Masculinity and femininity are part of gender and we know they exist, but they have no discernable midpoint between the two. It helps me to imagine an absolute femininity and an absolute masculinity that are both unattainable. In this binary every position in this binary can be understood as either masculine or feminine if held in relation to it's opposite. In such a binary masculinity and femininity still retain meaning and it's still possible to become more feminine or masculine. And any assertion to being masculine or feminine in the binary can be true in relation to it's opposite.

I personally think that the second conception of gender binary is perhaps still flawed due to the assertion that masculinity and femininity should exist in opposition. However in the lives of most nonbinary people I see on here, the opposition seems very important in how they express their identity by trying to move towards androgyny. Personally when I think about gender binary in the second way I described, I believe that androgyny can exist wherever you decide to position yourself within the gender binary. Because in between two unattainable absolutes you'll always be a mix of gender. I think that people worry too much about what blend of features make one acceptably androgynous, but this acceptable androgyny seems to be situated at the midpoint of the traditional gender binary instead of where ever they decide their androgyny is.

As someone who is panromantic, I feel my disconnection from the concept of gender helped me develop into a pan person. I never fell in love ""men"" and ""women"" and it was never that I actively looked for a man. As soon as I realized that I was able to like more than one gender was when the world finally felt a strange clarity where I finally felt things made sense but the rest of the world could never see it the way I do. I did not fall for my trans partner when she was still closeted and pretending to be male due to her masculinity. I was attracted to the way I could connect with her, see the stars in her eyes when we spoke, and trust her completely. 

&amp;#x200B;

As an asexual person, I am disconnected from society's connotation that sex=love. Sex was never something I truly desired. I have always been amused by it in theory and indifferent to it in real life. I've had sexually tense encounters with others where I felt completely uncomfortable. I have had sexual encounters where I felt safe and we were trusted. Either way, I never found connection there. I'm willing to do it for love within reason, but I never understood why people needed it to have a happy relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard to have these thoughts when the world sees you as a cis, heterosexual female dating a cis heterosexual male.  In reality, I am asexual, panromantic, nonbinary, and my partner is bicurious and a trans woman.

516,2019-07-10 13:47:42,cbgx0f,0,2,"I've sort of passively accepted that I'm an alcoholic for years and that I do it to settle a deep discomfort within me at all times. Because of it I never grew into a functional adult (mid 20s') and my life and responsibilities have been in nothing short of chaos and turmoil.

I happened to realize what that discomfort is: I've always felt physically uncomfortable to the point where I don't sit, stand, or walk normally. My posture is tense and strained and my gait is visibly forced and awkward. I constantly squirm around to get comfortable. It's strikingly obvious and I get comments on it ALL THE TIME. Even my voice and laugh are strained and that's always bothered me. 

It's because I'm subconciously trying to present as feminine, all the time, when that isn't my nature. My brain is constantly trying to correct my body into sitting/standing like a lady, walking with a feminine gait, and speaking at a higher pitch than my natural voice. Not to mention how getting dressed is always, always a shitty experience for me. I have been wearing t-shirts and button downs for a few years now instead of girly things or fitted shirts, but I still get really really hung up on jeans. I hate having to carry a purse because it makes me feel ridiculous.

So now I'm going to allow myself to wear men's jeans instead of worrying about showing my female shape. I'm gonna carry a wallet in the back pocket because who says that's an exclusively male thing? it's convenient and logical. I haven't bought shoes in years and I really need to, so those are comming from the men's section too as I've always wished they could be. I'm going to let myself walk with the comfortably loose swagger as my body wants, and ""manspread"" or sit with a foot propped on a knee like I really want to. I'm going to stop feeling like I need to pop my chest out and suck in my stomach or keep my butt out/back perfectly straight. And I'm letting my voice come out as naturally deep as it is. I've been doing this at home and already feel like I've been realigned.

I'm not uncomfortable with being female per say, I do have body issues with my, uh, reproductive organs but I believe that is normal and comes from social pressure to have a perfect, tight, young appearance forever both down below and up top. But I'm not feminine in mannerism or personality and I have no interest in forcing it upon myself anymore.

I don't think I'm gonna bother telling anyone else about it. If they ask, I'll just say ""I'm not a feminine person and this is what's comfortable for me."" If they specifically ask of I'm NB/Trans then I'll probably answer honestly because I'm not ashamed and it doesn't really matter what others think. I was just imposing those rules on myself and now that I'm honest with myself I can finally heal and move forward in my life without the discomfort holding me back.

I also broke a bender that's been going on for months. A full day sober yesterday and still going strong today. I'm shaking like a leaf but my god does it feel good to not be buzzed up right now. I'm joining a gym beside my work and going to start lifting and getting in shape. It's nothing but fair weather ahead of me now.

I found this sub when I started seriously questioning whether I was asexual. I wanted, to try and put this in a way that doesn't sound rotten, to avoid being ""different."" I realized that was toxic. It was beautifully overwhelming to read all your stories that could have come straight from own mouth. It all clicked and fell into place.

I'm 29 afab and just this week it dawned on me that I might be nonbinary. Possibly demigirl? I'm so confused.

The biggest thing that's bothering me is that the realization hit me suddenly like a ton of bricks, rather than feeling anything ""off"" all along the way, like so many trans stories I hear. Because this is so sudden, I'm afraid it's not real and my feelings are made up. Also, my age. So many trans people are very young and here I am, almost 30, and just now going through this.


I've always felt comfortable with femininity. I *thought* I loved being a girl. But I've struggled with body image issues for a long time and it has gotten much worse recently, and I thought it was body dysmorphic disorder (with help from a therapist) and I'm not saying it isn't, but the idea that gender *dysphoria* thrown in to the equation makes SO MUCH SENSE. 
My reasoning is this. I finally decided to try out the mentality of being enby. Of not having a gender, or not caring about gender - just being a human with a body first and foremost. And I felt immediate relief. I felt so much weight lifted off my shoulders. I think part of the problem is also the ""woman"" box has become too small for me. The pressure to be a woman and feminine 100% of the time was causing so much of my body image troubles because when I tried on the ""enby persona trial"" (heh), I felt so...good! I had breasts and big wide hips. But it didn't feel bad anymore. it just felt like a body. An un-gendered human body. I was just myself, and I just so happened to have boobs. (But, even if I decide to embrace the nb identity, because my self esteem issues are so deep I'm sure that won't cure it all the way, but just even that much pressure lifted off was and is amazing.)

But I'm afraid. I love being girly. I just don't like being forced to feel like a woman. So I'm worried that I'm actually a cis woman who's too much of a coward to just be gender nonconforming and keep it that. But on the other hand.... the label nonbinary, and the feeling of not necessarily having a specific gender, just feels right. 

I also wouldn't feel comfortable changing my names or pronouns. Like...they/them just feels too strange for me. And I don't feel like a man, so he/him doesn't fit either. So then......an afab enby using she/her and not even changing her name is just a cis girl wanting to be a special snowflake, right?

More thoughts. If you're questioning any aspect of your identity, isn't there a good chance you're probably right? I mean, if you weren't seriously considering it, you probably aren't that thing. Right?

When I got a boy haircut 2 years ago, I felt so amazing. This short hair just feels right. I never want to change it. When I first got it, i looked in the mirror and thought, ""This makes me look androgynous. I love it."" Even though I am/was a girl. To this day, my hair is the only thing non-feminine about my appearance. I don't really know what else I could feasibly change - my breasts are way, way too large to bind comfortably (I'm assuming) and even then it would take too much effort, as someone who has severe depression and not enough energy to go around. Besides, I like the idea of keeping my breasts as they are, but reframing them in my mind as just a feature of my body rather than seeing them as gendered. They are there, on my genderless body, and that's okay. 

So if nothing changes except my gender label, that just can't be valid. That doesnt add up. When people come out a certain way, something about them changes. Pronouns, body parts, name, etc. So if I'm nonbinary but nothing changes, I'm just an imposter.

People who don't know me would probably laugh internally when they see me and find out I'm not a woman. ""There is nothing un-feminine about her, except her hair but even then she still looks girly. She even uses feminine pronouns. She's just a girl."" 

More random body thoughts. I really hate having a vagina, and I would prefer having a penis, but it's complicated. I don't want either. I just wish I didn't have any genitals at all.

I wish I could come out but my family is mormon and don't like gays and my friends don't all believe in nonbinary genders.

I went through a hard time in my life and kinda distanced myself from all my friends but then when I was a bit better I almost exclusively hung out with guys and wanted to be one of them and constantly wondered if I was a trans guy. Then I got less depressed and sort of reverted back to only dealing with my female friends bc they are the ppl I talked to before the shitty time in my life. Now I deal with my female friends more bc I kinda fucked shit up with my guy friends. The main point of this is that I just feel so disconnected from all of my female friends. They're pretty much all straight girls and I identify as nonbinary and attracted to women so I can't relate to them on a lot of things. I honestly just have been waiting for when I can go off to college and hopefully come out and get friends that I have more in common with but I still have all of my senior year of highschool left. 

Basically being queer has made me feel extremely isolated and dirty. I don't really have anyone to talk to and I know that I wouldn't be accepted by most people. If I could just be straight ans cis my life would be a hell of a lot more bearable but hey ig that just sucks for me :(",NonBinary,Being queer kinda sucks?,1562843658.0,"{'created_utc': 1562818458, 'id': 'cbr4ik', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 4, 'selftext': ""I really wish I could just be a good ol cishet kidd but looks like that isn't really working.

Please excuse formatting, mobile ...

Please let me know if this needs to go somewhere else.

If any of the terms I use are offensive, I apologize in advance.  Let me know and I'll correct the issue.

I'm a 44 year old, biological male.  I've had a strong feminine side as far back as I can remember, like 10 or 12.  I've always had an interest in wearing women's clothing and make-up.  I've worn my hair long for most of my life.  I've always wanted to experience life as a woman.  

I came out to my wife a few years ago and she embraced it.  We have girls shopping afternoons.  We'll both get dressed up really nicely and cook a nice dinner and spend the evening having fun.  I'm still way not ready enough to head out in public en femme.

I don't want reassignment surgery and would likely only do minor facial enhancements, Adam's apple paring.

My family doesn't know about it, nor do my 11 and 12 year old kids, but they'd likely accept it as part of me and be supportive.

What I'm considering is beginning HRT and  possibly voice lessons and working on things that would help me be passable.  Then after a few months, when the effects start to show, get everyone together and let them in on it.

Anyone have any advice or words to the wise, tips and tricks, anything?  I looked all over the bookstore but couldn't find a strategy guide.

the effects of e that i like the sound of: 

* less body hair (body hair being my biggest current source of dysphoria)
* lower-body fat redistribution (my hips and ass, or rather the lack thereof, being close runner-up)
* no longer being absolutely petrified of one day balding
* softer skin and hair 

the effects i do Not like the sound of:

* upper-body fat redistribution (any breast growth whatsoever would def give me Bad dysphoria) 
* lowered libido 
* genital changes in general are a big nope 
* all the emotion stuff, my emotions are fucky enough already

So I bit the bullet and bought a session for electrolysis. It's something that I've thought about doing for the longest time. I work in the beauty industry, and for most of my career I only felt comfortable covering up my beard shadow. I present more andro/femme most days, and my makeup has slowly graduated from Instagram style to muted. I don't want to feel the need to wear full coverage foundation when I already have really clear skin.
The only problem I have is that because I use much less makeup my beard area tends to show and makes me feel gross about myself. 
It makes me feel dirty and unkempt, and also makes me feel invalid in my own gender. I've been teetering back and forth for the longest time, whilst also finding other less permanent solutions, like waxing, or in one extreme case, literally plucking my entire beard area *ouch*
I've been hesitant because my (23) partner (29) of nearly 4 years (cis gay male) had questioned whether or not I will regret it when I'm older. He said he felt the same way when he was younger about facial hair but embraced his hair and fell in love with having a beard. His questioning makes me feel like maybe I'm making the wrong decision and I guess I just need support in that I know what I want and what I'm doing. I discussed the same thing with my sister, and she said it was akin to a tattoo. It's gonna be a permanent modification, but if you regret it later down the line, then so be it.

I have a tendency to really like feminine clothing at times, and I want to wear them and get a bit ""dolled up"". However, when I do this, I always end up feeling dysphoria. It's like I'm declaring,""I'M A GIRL AND I'M OKAY WITH IT."" But I'm not a girl and I'm not okay with being one. I've had it drilled into my head over and over again that the only way I'll ever be seen as attractive is if I dress femininely. I have to put on makeup. I have to wear this and that to look ""prettier (all things said by my mother) and so whenever I get dressed up, I feel like it's never for me. It's for everyone else to see that I'm a ""girl"" or something. I hate it. As a result of this, whenever I dress more masc, (since that's my default) I feel disgusting. But dressing more femme just makes me feel...wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong. I don't know if this makes any sense.

TL;DR: Dressing femme is something I lean to at times, (putting on makeup, blouses, dresses) but I get dysphoria and I simultaneously feel like I'm dressing for others. But dressing more masc also makes me feel disgusting. Essentially dressing one way or the other makes me feel like I'm putting on a show.

660,2019-07-12 20:42:36,ccgd1t,2,22,"So, I recently left my church due to a disagreement in how they expect people who experience gender related dysphoria to manage it.  I say ""gender related dysphoria"" because to me it is has a broader scope of things that it refers to.  So, I sent an email to my small group to let them know that I will not be there going forward and they should know what's up.  The email was regarding my name change and coming out as non-binary gender fluid and why I was leaving.  I have been doing my Enby thing for a few months already so the email just gave the story behind it.  

So, I have gotten a few responses and three of them are fully supportive and accepting of me.  One of them said we accept you and all that but won't embrace me as female or male and female.  So, only seen as male.  He didn't mention non-binary or gender fluid but his message was clear.  Two of them used my new name so I count them as positive reactions.  The third email response was a full screen wall of text.  It was the most supportive, encouraging, loving response I have ever received.  

However, I re-read things because I fear there might be hidden messages and then I read things into it that were never said or even intended.  So, I write a wall of text back.  She writes another wall of text to me.  Now, she is saying all the right things.  However, I am not good at having friends so I over analyze things because I tend to mis-interpret people a lot.  But she is speaking directly and sincerely and I am looking for hidden messages of ""I don't really accept you but feel I should say these things out of love"".

So, I took a step of faith and spilled all these thoughts I was having and I was trying to reject them as fast as they came.  I want to trust her that what she is saying is sincere and just not platitudes.  

And you know act happened.  She completely understood where I was coming from and why I was acting the way I was.  So, she responded with a third wall of text reassuring me that she is totally sincere in everything said and that she is a safe place to come to about things.  She also went the extra mile say that this amount of email in one day is abnormal frequency.  And that she will be gone for the rest of the month out of state camping.  Setting expectations so I would start worrying that I did something wrong or my brain doing its thing.  She is amazing.  I knew that already but her support of me in this just elevated the amount of amazing.  This is not a romantic type relationship at all.  I am not looking for that.  But, I can't believe that I actually have a friend that I can open my heart up and let whatever is there spill out.  

Like I said I am still processing this...  right now I am seriously reconsidering if I want to come back to this church when the small group starts up again just so I can see this friend on a regular basis.   But, I also want to attend a church where the pastors are not trying to convince me that I am wrong.  So I am torn. 

Either way, I now have one supportive friend.  I think I have another at the church I switched back to as well which is making me want to stay at this church.

I'm a lil Frenchie who's been taking, leaving and taking up again the nonbinary label. The context in France is real different from what I gather it is in the US, trans issues are extremely rarely discussed and nonbinary identities are, well.... kind of just a meme. The French language has no neutral pronoun, every word is gendered so it's extremely hard to not gender yourself or someone else, and people are extremely adamant to correct you if you ""gender yourself wrong"". Moreover I'm AFAB, pretty chesty (I have a binder and it's great but far from flattening it all) and the only time people have been confused about my gender was when I had a buzzcut.... before they'd seen my face. In short: it's really hard for me to be seen as anything but a woman.

Leaving aside all consideration about what I ~feel~ inside (am I a woman? am I nonbinary? what does it all mean anyway?) I just kinda wanna be more androgynous and I don't know how to go about it.

Rocking a goth/industrial look was mentioned in a comment when I first posted, so here's an attempt.

It's been a good long while since I really did this look (masc)  and I never wore women's clothing then as far as I can recall.

Forgive my lack of proper accessories and the overall tameness.  To think, I just had my hands on my black straightjacket!  Oh well, I'm old, and moving, with anything from back in the day and most of my current kink-oriented stuff packed away.

To make up for it, I chose to include Vader's saber in some of the photos ...

I've had my sights on Elliott as a name for ages. I know it's trendy and pretty common. That's fine with me. There's a post in my history on another sub delving deeper into that and asking suggestions and such if you feel so inclined to look. But, to make a short story even shorter, it's just the name that resonates with me and it's who I am. Except, that to everyone else, it isn't.

  


I'm in the process of trying to change my name legally, and *oh friend*. I feel like a rock in my yard is smarter than me and would understand this process so much more. I understand the general gist of it - fill out paperwork, give them your money, see a judge, and then go about changing everything else for even more money. I think? My mind is a very disorganized place, so I tend to make lists frequently to keep things neat and understandable. But I have absolutely no clue how to go about making a step by step list for this process, because no matter how many times I read things over, I'm so confused.

  


My previously mentioned support system hasn't exactly been helpful. My mom is usually too preoccupied with other things (understandably due to other circumstances) and as much as my cat wants to help, well... She can't write or explain things in terms I understand. I mean, she definitely prefers attacking the pen rather than learning to use it. I'm basically stuck in place trying to understand how to begin.

  


Everything is different from place to place, and I don't know anybody around me who's gone through the process. I kind of don't really know anybody around me at all, despite living in the same area for years. Anxiety and some other issues, paired with the crippling fear of being rejected, has done wonders for me *as you can tell.* Anyway.

I never had any real confusion until I was 14. I just didn't really know if I was totally female. There were a few times I wanted to ""dress up"" as a boy and be seen as male when I was very young, but I was ok with that. Around 16 I started considering the fact that I may be a binary transgender male. I looked into this and after around a year of research I was absolutely certain I was male. I kept up this certainty for a year.   


Even though I am solely attracted to girls, I don't identify with the term ""straight"" at all. It doesn't feel right to me. I like being gay and I cling to that, it's part of my identity. When I realised this I began to think that I might be NB/GNC. Problem is, I want a traditionally masculine name, Luke. I want to be called by he/him pronouns, or they/theirs is cool too. But NOT she/her. I don't want to be seen as a woman, or female. My gender feels indescribable.   


I do want to know though, is it ""okay"" to be masculine leaning, attracted to girls, and gay? Do I need to accept that I am not gay, or is my identity my identity? I feel like there's a grey area when it comes to the sexualities of NB people, because gay typically means ""attracted to the same gender"" but I don't really... have a gender.

So, I'm MtF, in the early stages of hormones, but something happened last night that I've been thinking about a lot today. I noticed I often say on trans related subs ""I don't present feminine."" Or something to that effect. I realized last night that the way I present myself may not actually be as straight forward as I though. Other people may be picking up something different that what I thought I was displaying. Small things I started doing that make me feel better ended up being more than I realized. 

I realized that even though I've been saying that I present myself as male. I pain my nails. I shave my legs. I have long hair that I usually wear in a high pony tail. And I carry a purse. It's kind of a small messenger bag style almost, but you know what? It was marketed as a purse, and that's how I use it. 

Yesterday a friend and I went to another friends house. He lives in a that's pretty liberal. He lives in a college town with a much larger LGBT community than where I'm from, and he was part of some on campus LGBT thing, sorry I can't remember what it was. So he knows a lot of trans people. He lives about 150 miles away, but we drove up there after work because one of my favorite bands was playing there. 

So, I decided that I was going to come out to this friend. The friend I drove up there with already knew. So, when we get back to his place, I tell him, and he took it really well, as I expected. The first thing he did was asked my preferred pronouns. I told him that I prefer she/her or they/them. I've recently been considering going by they/them/theirs as kind of a transitionary thing. I know I hate masculine pronouns, and I know that I'm not ready for feminine pronouns. Then he asked if I was nonbinary or MtF. And then he told me that he thought I might be nonbinary before I came out to him. I realized that he never new me before I started picking up these habits, that I just totally forget about. I thought I was totally presenting masculine, but then ""Oh yeah, most people probably wouldn't consider these 'normal' things for a cis guy to do.

When I realized I was trans, I didn't know much. And all I ""knew"" was ""If I'm not a guy I guess I'm a gal"" All I knew was the gender binary. That was years ago though. I now understand that gender is a spectrum. But I've never gone back and thought, ""am I a woman?"" Until he told me that he thought I was nonbinary, I hadn't even thought about the possibility. After about 5 years of ""knowing"" I'm a trans women, here I am questioning my gender again. Or maybe it's just the pot talking. In the end, it doesn't really matter. I've already learned that I have to be me to be happy. I'll just keep being me and worry about labels later.

It was marketed as a purse, and that\'s how I use it. \n\nYesterday a friend and I went to another friends house. He lives in a that\'s pretty liberal. He lives in a college town with a much larger LGBT community than where I\'m from, and he was part of some on campus LGBT thing, sorry I can\'t remember what it was. So he knows a lot of trans people. He lives about 150 miles away, but we drove up there after work because one of my favorite bands was playing there. \n\nSo, I decided that I was going to come out to this friend. The friend I drove up there with already knew. So, when we get back to his place, I tell him, and he took it really well, as I expected. The first thing he did was asked my preferred pronouns. I told him that I prefer she/her or they/them. I\'ve recently been considering going by they/them/theirs as kind of a transitionary thing. I know I hate masculine pronouns, and I know that I\'m not ready for feminine pronouns. Then he asked if I was nonbinary or MtF. And then he told me that he thought I might be nonbinary before I came out to him. I realized that he never new me before I started picking up these habits, that I just totally forget about. I thought I was totally presenting masculine, but then ""Oh yeah, most people probably wouldn\'t consider these \'normal\' things for a cis guy to do.\n\nWhen I realized I was trans, I didn\'t know much. And all I ""knew"" was ""If I\'m not a guy I guess I\'m a gal"" All I knew was the gender binary. That was years ago though. I now understand that gender is a spectrum. But I\'ve never gone back and thought, ""am I a woman?"" Until he told me that he thought I was nonbinary, I hadn\'t even thought about the possibility. After about 5 years of ""knowing"" I\'m a trans women, here I am questioning my gender again. Or maybe it\'s just the pot talking. In the end, it doesn\'t really matter. I\'ve already learned that I have to be me to be happy. I\'ll just keep being me and worry about labels later.\n\nPlease leave comments with your thoughts so I\'ll have something to over analyze about myself when I wake up in the morning.

We are a group from Harvard Medical School creating a website intended to support gender diverse folks seeking information about the transition process. The online resources that currently exist for navigating the medical transition process are often confusing, inaccurate, or difficult to find. Our goal is to create an accessible, evidence-based, and centralized resource for people who are in the early stages of transitioning.

We want to ensure that this resource is created by queer folks and for queer folks, and we need your help!

I have a problem which others people may think is a nice problem to have. But it's creating a bit of an internal conflict: more people positively comment on my looks when I dress male conforming than when I dress fem.

Given that I'm quite fluid, some people make a big deal complimenting me when I dress masc after they see me dressed andro/fem for a while.

A second ""problem"" that I've mentioned before is that I don't have a ""taste"" for masc looks. I can't tell a handsome guy from an ugly one. And I can't tell which masc style looks good or not So I rely on other people's opinion. However, I have a strong taste for fem: I find fem cute and I can tell exactly what I like of each one.

In summary: I find masc clothes booring and I need to rely on others to see what looks good on me. I find fem clothes fun and I can tell when I feel cute.

However I'm used to be complimented and it sucks that outside this sub people only compliment me when masc.

Conflict: should I dress fem and feel cute trough my eyes even if I'm not complimented ? Should I dress masc and feel cute through other's eyes even if I don't see it?

External approval seems to weight a lot :(

I can barely begin to describe how uncomfortable I feel.

I have a career trajectory that would make a decently interesting story, HOWEVER: 

1) I have always hated attention being directed at me just for achieving things while female.
2) I don't identify as female, but am not out at work to most ppl (including HR). I'm semi-out to my direct manager, but he's out of town this week. 

But I also really shouldn't refuse. I've been saying no to a bunch of sid at work lately due to burnout, and I just declined an interview a few weeks back b/c they wanted me to talk about a tour product I hadn't been on in 2 years, with a focus on the part of it I liked the least. Had a straight up panic over it before politely declining. But anyhow, I shouldn't keep saying no. 

I'm still trying to figure out a bunch of stuff w.r.t. my gender (am I NB or trans, what flavor of NB, what pronouns don't itch), which is why I'm not out (don't want to have to come out more than once), but I sure as heck don't want to be in the papers as ""one of &lt;company name&gt;'s female captains"".

So I've got to figure out how to handle this, and probably within the next 14 hours so I'm not rudely ignoring a work email. 

I feel so stuck! Either I've got to come out before I am at all ready, to our PR people AND HR (and possibly media if they still want my interview), or I've got to put a people-pleasing hat on and die inside during an interview that will further entrench the perception that I'm a gender that I'm not. What I really want to do is tell them that it's really freaking irritating that they are focusing on the gender of any of the captains and they should knock it off, but they want to collect on their inclusivity brownie points and I need to not bite the hand that feeds me and my excellent health insurance. 

How the heck do I handle this, fam? It feels like there's no right answer. I'd ask my manager, but he's nowhere near cell service, and I'd ask my therapist, but she's busy til my Friday appointment. What should I do?

I talked a bit with my mother, and she told me she remembered all the times I enjoyed wearing dresses and similar things as a kid (I have almost no memories of that), and it was very nice.

But then I asked her some help to put some nail polish, and she told me it was ""disturbing"". So I dug a little bit, and it seems that I can be feminine/androgynous only in a certain way or she won't like it.

Luckily she said hi during the walk and she didn't say anything about my (very) girly t-shirt (a present from my lovely girlfriend that I want to wear at every pride ever) and my heels. So I guess she's more cool than I feared, or she manages to hide it.

1106,2019-07-17 09:17:02,ceafkw,2,8,"I'm not really good at explaining things so I apologize if this sounds odd, I'm autistic and bad with words. Here's some quick background: I'm 21, afab, American, and under my parent's health insurance. 

Anyways, I realized I wasn't cis about a year ago, and it's like everything just clicked. I originally came out to the internet, my husband, and two close friends as genderfluid, but I now just identify as nonbinary. I originally wasn't planning on really transitioning, but over the past six months or so my dysphoria has been getting drastically worse, and now I don't know what to do. Since I was 14, I've always presented very feminine and I thought I loved having a 34G bust, even though I was constantly experiencing depersonalization. Now I think I want to transition to be transmasc, but I'm scared of making the wrong decision, so ideally I'd like to try presenting masc more and more often to see if it feels right. 

The issue is that I can't pass without binding, and it's very risky for me to bind because of health conditions. I have fibromyalgia and Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disorder, which both cause chronic pain and severe heat intolerance, and my anti depressants make me very prone to heat exhaustion and heat stroke (it's 95¬∞F in OH currently), to the point that I only wear tank tops and shorts, and sometimes a thin hoodie in the below zero winters. I'm also autistic, so I have severe sensory overload issues as well, and can hardly tolerate a bra, and I can't stand t-shirts. Basically I'm constantly overheating on the verge of heat exhaustion, and I have sensory overload from most clothing üëç 

I have two binders that work well and are tolerable, but that doesn't matter much when it's too hot to safely bind. I'm just staying home all day, I rarely go out because I get dysphoria from presenting female, and I can't really present male until it cools down a lot.

I am very new to this reddit, but seemed nice to find other people that might have similar thoughts about themselves :) 
While I am not new to not identifying myself as my physical gender, it hasn‚Äôt been that long since I started to tell other people about it and make more of an effort and statement that this is me (regardless of what I am physically).
So on and off I have been thinking about changing my name to a gender neutral name and this made me wonder some things, and I thought I could ask here :) 
I like my given name but it is clearly feminine and I‚Äôd rather have something less obvious. How did you guys, come to accept changing name and how did you start thinking about yourself in the new name instead? 
How did you tell your parents (if they are present in your life) about the name change?

I have no real problem with doing so, but living in the area we do, it's been difficult finding a place that does assement on adults (and doesn't involve committing to a long-term counseling relationship rather than an assessment period, as I prefer to avoid such).\n\nWhat I really want to know, should anyone have any experience with TEACCH, is if the centers /assement are LGBTQA+ friendly? I love how intersected the autistic and nb communities are, but I'm worried about assessment treating me being agender (and pansexual/demiromantic) as something negative or harping on it. Also I don't really want to be constantly deadnamed and/or misgendered for however long it takes to get through the assessment period.\n\nThis seems like my best shot, but it's surprisingly hard to find even general information on these centers other than the less than thorough rundown on their website. All things considered, getting this assessment done isn't exactly an absolute necessity, but if anyone has this information I would appreciate it."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Are TEACCH Centers/Autism Assessments (in NC) LGBTQA+, particularly non-binary, friendly?', 'created': 1563415978.0}"

First I wanna say that I totally get exploring presentation can be exciting and everything, but I keep seeing people label their style as ""femme."" From my understanding, this is a descriptor for lesbians and was created due to their presentation not revolving around men.

Maybe I'm just being pedantic but I see people labeling themselves as femme when it seems like they're using it as shorthand for dressing femininely. Of course this doesn't count for NB lesbians, but I'm not sure everyone using it is lesbian.

1173,2019-07-18 11:59:54,cerk22,0,1,"my dad has always known that im nonbinary and tries to be as gender neutral with me as possible. however, he completely gave up on trying to use my pronouns (I've customized mines with one added neopronoun) and since he struggled, i told him he could just use they/them and he was better with that at first, but after some time he got sick of using those for me too so immediately defaulted me with he/him pronouns. i assumed maybe it's because my little brother is trans too, so by treating us both trans masculine it would help him a lot more.

im just gonna say right now that im straight up uncomfortable and dysphoric. im dysphoric in both binary genders and do not align myself. even if i do identify as a femandrogyne i still do not consider myself binary aligned. honestly, i hate even hate having to disclose my birth assignment as even that makes me feel invalid and that I'll never escape the gender binary and be androgynous enough (I can't fucking pass for the life of me) so....i did the worst thing finally by asking my dad whats going on

i asked him yesterday why does he ignore my pronouns for he/him and brought up that he even told the ambulance when i broke my ankle that i was female to male transgender (as he exactly worded it) he doesn't even remember that he did that, but he explained that he uses those pronouns for me because he just can't and never will understand what i mean when i say that im nonbinary.

he has a basic understanding of people who are like bigender for instance, but he doesn't think thats nonbinary. to him, binary means two meaning it's not about being one or the other, you are both of them. he denies having a binary gender himself because he doesn't have two genders. i was scared to tell him that im androgyne because while that would help him understand better, the talk about that stuff not truly being nonbinary, that i would have to be straight up agender made me feel really scared. i was scared that he'll end up taking and invalidating my identity away from me in that i express that it's not binary, meaning i am not one or the other.

i tried really really hard in explaining, i even asked if he's willing to go to gender workshops with me and he told me there's no point in doing that as he's tried to do his own research. he told me he'll accept me as whatever i am, but he can't and never will understand this. I'd be ok with that, but he also explained in depth how this stuff is made up and that this never existed until now. i tried to bring up the history of cultural genders and how colonization greatly effected that but then he started telling me that thats wrong, that native Americans even judged eachother if they were two spirit and had to get a shaman to bless them that they're sacred in order for them to be left alone.

the reason why i brought this up was because i thought talking about shamanism and spirituality would help him understand, it sounded like it's worked before. my dad is a brujo and told me he has to think in that mindset in order to grasp what im talking about. how souls tend to either be genderless or have all genders if they've been reincarnated enough. it helps knowing that he's tried even within that headspace, but to tell me that even that history is inaccurate and um..  he even told me that srs exists BECAUSE of colonization (like colonizers to him apparently forced indigenous people to be nonbinary through castration) it sounds REALLY REALLY BAD and im sorry if this triggers anyone especially poc. i know nonbinary was coined way later but the concept of genders outside the binary has always existed is what im getting at.

oddly enough, despite how he keeps bringing up that souls have no gender, he doesn't even believe in agender people. im not even agender but thats how he sees me when i say im nonbinary. he tells me im still valid, but he has no idea what it is or if its even real. he goes on that there's no scientific proof and all that bullshit even tho we've had genuine discussions about that including intersex people (not saying their bodies are agender unless they define it that way, but saying that sex isn't binary either) and talking about how gender is absolutely physical no matter what otherwise no one would pay hundreds and millions of dollars getting surgeries.

ok I WAS SO TIRED AT THIS POINT but what i wanna get to the bottom of this is that i think centrist politics is honestly rotting his brain. im sorry if any centrist person here will get offended by that, but he's getting so much toxic information from these political YouTube channels and research that of course he wouldn't understand this shit. centrists are always trying to be like ""im totally accepting and i think people should do whatever they want but ALSO these bigots are right about what they gotta say on minorities"" so......you know

just for your information im gonna immediately block and report if anyone tries to debate with me about the validity of neopronouns and shamanism. i have no patience for that shit as i know even this community can have the biggest bigots. im just really frustrated because i thought he totally accepted me but i feel like he doesn't. i flew all the way to another state thinking that im loved despite who i am, and he does still say that he loves me even tho im like this. but I'm hurt he told me the things he did and even turned down an opportunity to work on understanding my gender together by actually going to events. i think his harmful centrist views are preventing him from getting better and i never wanted to discuss politics to begin with, i just wanted to express to him that it hurts when he treats me transmasculine, im not my little brother and i want my identity to actually be valid without questioning its existance.",NonBinary,"i wonder if centrist politics prevent my dad in totally approving my gender (cw politics, spirituality, colonization, neopronouns)",1563476394.0,"{'created_utc': 1563451194, 'id': 'cerk22', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'my dad has always known that im nonbinary and tries to be as gender neutral with me as possible. however, he completely gave up on trying to use my pronouns (I\'ve customized mines with one added neopronoun) and since he struggled, i told him he could just use they/them and he was better with that at first, but after some time he got sick of using those for me too so immediately defaulted me with he/him pronouns. i assumed maybe it\'s because my little brother is trans too, so by treating us both trans masculine it would help him a lot more.\n\nim just gonna say right now that im straight up uncomfortable and dysphoric. im dysphoric in both binary genders and do not align myself. even if i do identify as a femandrogyne i still do not consider myself binary aligned. honestly, i hate even hate having to disclose my birth assignment as even that makes me feel invalid and that I\'ll never escape the gender binary and be androgynous enough (I can\'t fucking pass for the life of me) so....i did the worst thing finally by asking my dad whats going on\n\ni asked him yesterday why does he ignore my pronouns for he/him and brought up that he even told the ambulance when i broke my ankle that i was female to male transgender (as he exactly worded it) he doesn\'t even remember that he did that, but he explained that he uses those pronouns for me because he just can\'t and never will understand what i mean when i say that im nonbinary.\n\nhe has a basic understanding of people who are like bigender for instance, but he doesn\'t think thats nonbinary. to him, binary means two meaning it\'s not about being one or the other, you are both of them. he denies having a binary gender himself because he doesn\'t have two genders. i was scared to tell him that im androgyne because while that would help him understand better, the talk about that stuff not truly being nonbinary, that i would have to be straight up agender made me feel really scared. i was scared that he\'ll end up taking and invalidating my identity away from me in that i express that it\'s not binary, meaning i am not one or the other.\n\ni tried really really hard in explaining, i even asked if he\'s willing to go to gender workshops with me and he told me there\'s no point in doing that as he\'s tried to do his own research. he told me he\'ll accept me as whatever i am, but he can\'t and never will understand this.

But I've always felt uncomfortable in my skin even at a young age. I hate being called ""miss"" or ""ma'am."" I never understood why I hated having breasts but now it makes more sense. I always wore tight sports bras and layered shirts to hide them as a teenager. As an adult, I do something similar but safer.

-- 
Gender confusion started a long time ago, but the questions seemed innocent and angsty and so confused and nebulous, and they got locked up and pushed aside and repressed and went unanswered.  And then visiting /r/bi_irl turned into visiting /r/egg_irl and then I got hit by the gender identity confusion freight train.

I was already under considerable mental and emotional pressure from events and things happening around me over which I feel little control: work, home, relationship, family, parenthood, you name it.  I knew I was dangerously close to ‚Äòcracking up‚Äô psychologically.

I didn‚Äôt know even know that this egg was there, let alone that it was going to crack regardless of the inconvenience, repercussions or practicality of the matter.  But it did start to crack and I found inside of it the idea that I am non-binary.  Inside, I am not a one-gendered being.  The maleness I‚Äôve never been completely comfortable with could take a step back and leave room for what was once called my ‚Äúfeminine side‚Äù to exist.

In short, I could just be a person and not live in a prison defined by internalized gender roles and identities.  The ones that I let in and let take over because I had to just get things done and live my life.  And perhaps most importantly, the identities and roles I felt I needed to have in order to have relationships with my family members and in order to form relationships with the people around me.

I posted a photo here just 13 days ago ‚Ä¶ after having the courage to put on a woman‚Äôs top for the first time and realizing that I wanted to feel pretty and that it wasn‚Äôt just confusion going on inside and a process that I needed to do inside myself in order to ‚Äúresolve‚Äù the confusion and crisis of unearthing my non-binary nature.

Y‚Äôall have been super supportive and made me feel validated, praised me for being out there and recognized the confidence that I have had that this is not just some ‚Äúthing‚Äù going on but something embedded in my core.  You could see me and being seen, I could cry, am tearing up in fact already, that strangers on the internet did that.  They could see me.

I don‚Äôt want to be a stranger to you or to myself.  I want the strength of not being some stranger to be avoided and ignored by myself, by everyone, remaining unseen.

But confidence does not come without questioning, and bravery does not come without fear.  And the joy of discovery and setting out to new continents, uncharted ‚Ä¶ it does not hide or take away the sadness I hold inside, that you can see on most days behind my eyes.

Just 13 days after feeling so pretty and making that first post, and now it‚Äôs feeling too painful.  What I am asking my family to endure, the future unfolding that doesn‚Äôt feel like I can control anymore than I can control what came before ‚Ä¶

I went to a trans/gender identity support group last night for the first time.  My SO came along.  Near the end, a woman talked to me about the selfish nature of what is happening with me right now.  I know the situation from my struggles with mental illness, how selfish those diseases are and how damaging to relationships.

My SO has been supportive, although I know that she doesn‚Äôt really understand.  It turns out that it was selfish of me to have her come along to the group.  She was too tired to spend several hours there and to hear from me ‚Äúhormones are not out of the question‚Äù and whatever other things that I said that are scary to her, whatever things she heard from the trans women there that scared her ‚Ä¶ the fear that she is carrying that I‚Äôm not actually NB but am trans and just in the process of coming to terms with it.

I told her last night that I should ‚Äújust lock this back up‚Äù and she knew, it feels like she always knows even when it hurts so bad ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúyou have to figure this out now, because you can‚Äôt lock this up for another 5 years or whatever.  I need to know before I marry you and we buy a house and ...""

I want to tell my story but I want to know for myself what that story is more than anything.  And I wish it wasn't feeling so painful.

We are a group of researchers from Harvard Medical School and Boston Children‚Äôs hospital investigating transfeminine people‚Äôs experiences stopping estrogen prior to surgery.

The use of estrogen is thought to increase the risk of certain health complications (e.g. blood clots) both during and after surgery, but the evidence behind this is controversial. Many surgeons require patients on estrogen therapy to temporarily discontinue it prior to their procedure. However, little is known about the impact of this experience on patients, and consequently, there are no official guidelines in place regarding estrogen cessation prior to surgery.

If you‚Äôve experienced this before, we invite you to participate in an online focus group to share your thoughts. Your contributions could help us significantly improve the care of transfeminine people undergoing surgery!

**Please take 1 minute to fill out the following survey to check whether you are eligible:** [**http://j.mp/2KLK4k6**](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__j.mp_2KLK4k6&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&amp;r=__4EGmqb7ds3F-5hBbVLN3jW072tUMOX13V0z5zVmQU&amp;m=fIBRFypeDnoRE6Cpg6wtZNZmyiZxAND7VydIoPJd5KA&amp;s=niZ9HAL2cQBI3fzaelWhe0MQTOYUgpssowVfkEzL7T4&amp;e=)**.**

I told her I was surprised she was taking it like she was and that I didn't expect the conversation to be as difficult as she made it and she said that was expected. She told me that I have queer friends because I want to be seen as accepting which feels pretty terrible. (Actually my friends are queer because straight cis people are mostly fucking boring AND because I relate to queer people as a queer person!) She told me that my generation overthinks gender. It was awful and it really surprised me. My dad is out of the country right now and I haven't come out to him. I told my mom she can tell him but I don't know how she would phrase it or if she can be honest or if she even understands. I feel sort of self indulgent posting this so I'm sorry. I feel like my coming out is way easier than so many people's but I still had to rant.

So today I had an appointment at the endocrinologist and I was really anxious about it- I thought me being non-binary and like wanting hrt would make them laugh and not care about me.  
But like deus ex machina they actually took me seriously and brought in someone who had worked with 90 transgender patents- I was about to tear up at the fact the doctor acknowledge me and took me serious  
Pleasantly I opened up to her about my dysphoria and was able to hand me resources and consent forms for me, my parents, and my therapist to fill out.  
I've never been to thrilled in my life!!- I'm honestly still shocked that all the luck my trans friends were giving me worked.  
Now hopefully I get my blood work tests done, fill out the sheets and get a gender dysphoria diagnosis, and within less than a month I can go on hormones.

1451,2019-07-23 05:57:34,cgopa7,0,5,"Hello, this is my first time posting here, though I have been in this sub for what it feels like quite a long time now. Sorry if this post is too long, but I feel like I have no one to talk to about what follows next.

I live in Mexico, and in two weeks I will move out of my mom's house to attend university in another city. This is scary but mainly exciting, as now I will have the opportunity to truly be myself. I was AFAB, and thus I had always been forced to present as a woman, even though I would prefer a more androgynous look. I consider myself to be agender and though I do not experience much body dysphoria, I feel lots of social dysphoria. This led me to consider starting T as soon as I was able to, just to not be gendered female anyore. But now I am not sure if that would be something I would be comfortable with.

Recently I chose a new name for myself. I am kind of proud of it because I think it sounds gender neutral even if it is considered a ""boy's"" name and it has personal meaning. Only my closer friends and my partner, who is also non binary, know about it. They all have been great at respecting it, but it is hard to know that there are many people who know you by a name that makes you uncomfortable and, furthermore, my family calls me by my dead name because I have not disclosed my gender identity yet. I fear they would never understand. It was hard enough to have my mom find out I was not straight. 

Pronouns are hard for me. Spanish is a very gendered languaje. I try to avoid any pronouns or adjectives when talking about myself with people I am not out to, but of course they do not notice that and call me by female pronouns. For a year now, I have asked people I trust (close friends and my partner) to call me by neutral pronouns (""elle"" - invented by non binary and queer people who speak Spanish, but not recognized as official, as the language only takes into account the existence of two genders), and it makes me very happy when they use them for me. I also use them for myself when I am with them.

So I have been thinking of what to do at my new city. I will definitely start introducing myself by my real name, and I will look how can I get it legally changed as soon as possible (I'm 18). I do not know what to do about my gender marker - it can be changed, but only to ""male"" or ""female"". I would like to ask the teachers at universities to not call me by my dead name, but I am afraid to do so. I do not want to get in trouble, because I will depend on a full scholarship given by the school. Furthermore, what if I am not taken seriously because I look ""like a woman""?

And what to do about my pronouns? I feel anxious just thinking about being gendered female again by classmates, but I cannot see myself asking people who I do not trust to use neutral pronouns. At best, there will be a lot of questions and I will be asked to justify my identity. At worst, I will be actively discriminated against for ""trying to be special"" or for being queer. I am afraid.

I will cut my hair short, but I do not what style I should get. As a result of being forced to present in a feminine way, I feel anxious just getting near a hair-dresser. Too many bad memories. And looking through styles feels like a big impossible task - how will I know what will look good on me? 

I will start saving money to buy a binder. I would like to see a flat chest when I put on clothes. I do not know if I would like a top surgery though. I mean, I do not feel dysphoric about my chest but I would like to not notice (or have anyone notice) my boobs behind my shirts, if that makes sense. I will start buying more masculine clothes (though i know 0 about fashion). I will maybe start using make-up to make my face look more masculine, though I do not know if this is possible (and I have never used make-up before so I do not trust myself to achieve this). I would also love to train my voice to be more masculine, though I have no idea where to even start...

TL;DR: I will start living in a new city, I feel like this is my chance to live my inner truth as an agender person but I am also afraid and I do not know what to do about anything. 

I will appreciate any advice. Has any of you been in this situation before?

The series explores a decaying, autumnal world and the enormous god husks that shape its regions. We follow two joined caravans, banded together by disaster; the displaced village of Ninut, and deserters of the Parish. It's kind of foklore-ish, slow paced and narrative heavy. We're working on writing up the rulebooks at the minute so people can have a go with them themselves!

While I don't think any of these people I interacted with meant these things maliciously, there ignorance was still very harmful.

&amp;#x200B;

I think it's important for all of us to consider our place in the trans community (which we are part of btw) and how are views can be harmful to those around us. I think we can all minimize our harm by educating ourselves on the trans community, our history, and what it means to be trans. Some basics things to get us started - mostly for those new to the community or still young:

&amp;#x200B;

* Trans does not mean transitioning. It means you don't identify as the same gender you were assigned at birth (agab) and as such all nb people are trans.
* On a similar point, you do not need to be medically, socially, or personally transitioning to be trans.
* Viewing people based on their genitals or agab is transphobia plain and simple. Same with discussing anything ""biological.""
* Nb encompasses a literal infinite amount of genders. If you don't feel masc, fem, or androgynous that's OK! There's more out. Our language is far behind the curve when it comes to gender and we don't have a lot of words to describe our feelings.
* On a similar note you can be gay or lesbian and still be attracted to someone whose nb. See point above if this confuses you.
* Black trans women literally built this community be thankful for them.
* Terfs are radical feminist who view trans women as men. They rhetoric is rooted is transmisogyny and as such are an enemy of the trans community.
* Trans meds are people who believe you must medically transition to be considered male. By and large they also believe you must have dsyphoria and they don't believe in the existence of nonbinary genders. Much of these beliefs are rooted in internalized transphobia. If you believe any of this please question why and who is benefiting from your gatekeeping (hint it's the cis).

If they leave the ovaries and fallopian tubes, I must not take HRT. Everything stays as is for now. But then I was asked if I‚Äôd like to have the ovaries and fallopian tubes be removed as well. I know that this would rid me of pelvic pain and traumatic medical procedures for good. This would be big for me. Common sense says to sign up for it.

However, I am in a bit of a unique situation. I am not FTM, I‚Äôm nonbinary.

I never took T. I want to trial it. 

I asked four of my doctors and got four different opinions:

1) If I don‚Äôt take estrogen, my bones will become brittle and I will experience breaks. Osteoporosis will be inevitable. The mood swings of surgically induced menopause will be out of control, possibly making me depressed and suicidal. He does not prescribe progesterone. 

2) Elderly cis women who already are or went through menopause are often not prescribed HRT. They seem to be doing fine, but there is no data on younger people my age and no advice can be given.

3) Estrogen is the standard prescription. All the cis women patients take it post op and all the transmen patients take T, instead. Commit to one of them. Taking estrogen might have bigger risks than not taking it, though. If I take estrogen, I must take progesterone with it. Not supplementing that in conjunction with estrogen is ancient medicine. Pure estrogen heightens the risk of breast cancer, strokes, migraines and mood swings. If I wanted a mastectomy anway, we could talk about only taking estrogen.

4) Leave the ovaries intact to avoid this discussion and be happy with the absence of my uterus and periods.  Transmen and nonbinary people alike have to toughen up and see gynecologists on a regular basis, no matter the dysphoria or trauma.

1806,2019-07-27 04:17:54,cid1jf,8,37,"So, I went to my appointment at Planned Parenthood in Ventura, Ca. I'd like to preface this with the fact that I think that they are an absolutely amazing organization. They are an absolute ally of the community and I wish them no ill will at all. This was my experience at one center that had just started doing HRT and based on my experience, they didn't have the proper training to handle HRT for a Non-Binary person.

I had spoken with the GNC specialist who said that I should be able to leave with a prescription the day of my appointment.  I had also verified ahead of time that I would be able to get a prescription for a DHT blocker which I want to use to limit body hair growth and bottom growth (it also does help to prevent head hair loss but that is not why I had requested it). They would start me on informed consent, then I could continue there or switch to someone else to monitor my care. I was explicitly told by the GNC specialist that these details would all be put in my chart and none of it should be a problem in theory.

Check-in went perfectly, they used my preferred name and didn't misgender me or assume anything about me. I went back into the room alone and someone interviewed me. It was the same questions the GNC specialist had asked me which is good to do in case people couldn't be honest on the phone for some reason. While being interviewed I disclosed that I had not had an STD test before (I've just never been with anyone I've had to worry about that with so I haven't done it. I am aware I should still get tested). I told her that I would deal with that at a later visit as I had not mentally prepared and she was fine. She went out to get my partner from the waiting room and I'm really glad I had him in there because that's where everything took a weird/bad turn.

The nurse practitioner came in and basically flat out said that it was against protocol to give DHT blockers and T at the same time. She also flat out told me they don't prescribe gel even though the GNC specialist had also said that they could prescribe it but my insurance my not cover it. When I brought up that I had already verified that I should be able to get it she started going on and on about hair loss and why I shouldn't be scared of it. I insisted through all of it that I wasn't concerned about hair loss and I had done a lot of research (not just Reddit, I mean looking at a lot of  well thought of patient guides and studies over a series of months) that indicated that it minimized bottom growth and body hair growth as well as possibly some voice drop. This was absolutely disregarded and she flat out told me that DHT blockers cancel out the effects of T completely and there was no point of taking them together. (Just plain wrong). She insisted that she had talked to a doctor about it before my appointment and they would refuse to prescribe them at the same time because of it but I pointed out to her that the situation is obviously different because I am not a trans man, I am in fact non-binary, and maybe the doctor hadn't been told that. Through all of this, I had openly and repeatedly stated that I know that you can not pick and chose the effects you get but that this is the only combination I was comfortable with because the symptoms that I was listing were permanent and especially bottom growth could happen fairly quickly so I wanted to do everything I could to minimize it.

So, she left the room to supposedly call the doctor ""up in Ojai"". (That's where I live btw and no mention the entire visit of this doctor's name.) When she got back she implied that she had talked it over with the doctor and then just tried to divert the situation away from it completely by saying that T would have ""effects on my liver and blood"" (which from my research the liver thing seems to only be for when you take it in pill form). I told her that I fully knew it had effects that came with risks and I was willing to take them but only if I could do it with a DHT blocker and that if I couldn't do that I wasn't interested in taking hormones from them at all. This was all through the informed consent system. I wrongly assumed that meant that I would be informed of the risks of what I wanted to do, sign a form, and get a prescription and take any liability for what happened onto myself. She just said that she couldn't guarantee my effects (never asked her to) and basically refused again when I asked to even consider the situation a bit more from the perspective that I am not a man and may have different goals than she's used to. (And even if I was a trans man who was concerned about hair loss I should still have been able to sign the forms and get the care I needed through the informed consent model).

She then continued to try and divert me by saying that it was a No-No to get pregnant while on T. I said that was fine and I had already received info on getting a copper IUD. She asked if I wanted to get that today and I said that I was not mentally prepared and would be looking into it at a later date. She continued to try to convince me to get it that day saying that I should focus on that before T. Part of her tactic to try and get me to get one today was to tell me ""it doesn't matter how tight you are, I've put IUD's into 14-year-old virgins, I can get one in you."" What. The. Fuck. was the only thing that I or my partner could think. At that point, I knew I'd be leaving and wouldn't be coming back.

She had absolutely no concept that the reason that I wasn't ok with doing an STD test or an IUD that day. Even though I don't have the worst dysphoria down there I have enough that I can't do stuff like that without a LOT of mental preparation and between the reason for my visit and my pronoun pin coupled with the fact that I had already said I wasn't prepared for that today,  I figured she would understand that that was why I wasn't ok with it and drop it.

I shut things down pretty quickly after that and simply asked if she had any recommendations on where I could get better GNC care. She vaguely said that she had heard of some places in Santa Monica and I was asked one final time if I was doing T or not. I said no and she lead us out.

There was obviously a huge disconnect in whatever was happening there and it made me feel completely erased as a non-binary person. I'm fairly certain they didn't see beyond ""FTM who doesn't wanna go bald"" when it came to the actual hormones and I could see there was no way fix that. I had to say repeatedly during my appointment ""but I'm not a trans man"" because she was assuming I wanted or didn't want certain things based on the fact that I was trying to get on T.

I don't know if this is typical. I don't know if it was just this one person. I can't say for sure that anyone else would have an experience like this. But I wanted to share because if I had known this could happen it would have tempered my expectations today that had been given to me by the GNC specialist (who I will be speaking to first thing Monday about my experience to figure out if he has no clue what he's talking about or if the nurse practitioner was assuming too much and not being flexible enough to even talk to me). You can still go there. Other clinics that have been doing this longer may have more experience and you may have a totally positive experience. But beware, just because an organization is friendly doesn't mean that the path is easy for us.

On a more positive note, my new health insurance kicks in next Thursday and I should be able to go see an actual endocrinologist soon who will be more skilled to take care of my particular situation.

Hey everyone, forgive my ignorance in advance, I was hoping we could launch a discussion on this topic. As a rather old cis person, up until recently I just addressed people based on their external appearance. It has always been considerably easy for me to figure out if I should address someone as ''Miss/she/her'' or ''Mister/he/him''. However, as I take an interest in gender diversity, I realise that people's external appearance doesn't always determine who they are inside and I know that addressing them by the wrong gender pronoun can be upsetting. Old-fashioned me then thought she'd just keep calling people Miss/Mister if they appeared to be cis, and to politely inquire how they prefer to be called if the person looks androgynous. However, I have read great articles on the subject that note that not all non-binary people are necessarily androgynous, meaning literally anyone you see could identify as non-binary.

im on the autistic spectrum. as a result of that and me being,,, weird my most playmates as a kid were amab. i love lifting weights and i also love other shit that's seen as masculine stuff. videogames, science, sports, button-downs...

but. there's all this... my body is very feminine, soft n round with wide-ish hips and breasts that are impossible to hide (they're not huge but I don't want to bind and E-cup is too much to hide without with my body shape). 
i abso-fucking-lutely love sewing, painting, baking, cooking, cleaning... things that are traditionally seen as Female Only‚Ñ¢. i also love wearing eyeshadows, lipsticks, dresses and skirts... i also like to wear heels.

So I'm genderfluid, but I only realised about a year or 2 ago (it explains so much and I'm so happy with the label). My best friend, about 4 years ago, used to go on rants about how there's only 2 genders, and she made attack helicopter jokes. I used to really really look up to her, so I kind of went along with it. I feel bad about that now, but I was pretty young and just kind of believed everything she said. being able to recognise I've grown as a person since then makes me kind of proud of myself. After realising I was genderfluid I was like, shit bro what if she still thinks all this?? It's been a while... She might have changed her opinion, right?? But recently she said some shit like, nonbinary people don't exist??? I tried to argue with her, get her to clarify what the hell she means by that, but something came up and we didn't talk about it anymore. Since then tho, I've been sort of dying to bring it up again, and despite everything I really wanted to come out to her. She means a lot to me, y'know? So a couple months back I came out, and she said ""I don't understand but im not gonna say youre wrong"" or something, but it was pretty clear she ""disapproved"" or whatever. It just makes me upset? Like, I don't want to assume the worst (that she's like, still incredibly enbyphobic and judges me about this a lot), but she's kind of a judgemental person so :///.

But recently she said some shit like, nonbinary people don\'t exist??? I tried to argue with her, get her to clarify what the hell she means by that, but something came up and we didn\'t talk about it anymore. Since then tho, I\'ve been sort of dying to bring it up again, and despite everything I really wanted to come out to her. She means a lot to me, y\'know?

* Where/when do you feel safe presenting in a gender-nonconforming way? Where/when do you feel unsafe?
* Have you ever experienced harassment/discrimination/assault because of the way you present?
* Do you take any specific safety precautions when presenting in a gender-nonconforming way?
* Do you ever deliberately try to ""pass"" as having a binary presentation?

Okay I'll just start of by saying this going to be kind of a stupid post, because I don't even really know what I'm asking, but hear me out.

When I started transitioning I thought I was FTM. Puberty was pretty traumatic for me and I hated everything to do with it. But after I started T, that all started to calm down and I started to accept my feminine side more. Which made me realize I was actually non-binary. I'm still leaning a bit more to the male side though. My name and gender marker is male and I look 100% male . On rare occasions I polish my nails (but usually not when I'm planning on going out), but outside from that there isn't anything noticeable from the outside that would make anyone think I'm anything but a man. Most people don't even know that I'm trans.

The thing is, a while ago I quite suddenly started having the urge to have children (really as the mother). Since this has been consistent for quit some months, I am pretty sure this feeling won't just go away. Before I was pretty neutral on the subject of having children. And I didn't really have any long-term plans on what to with my live. I am not ambitious about work and I don't want to travel the world or things like that. But since this feeling started it really feels like the pieces have fallen together. Like that is what I want to do with my life, have a bunch of children. Be a stay-at-home mom (at least while they are still children). Like if I died right now, not ever having been able to have children would be my one regret. 

Which is why I am concerned about my fertility. There is very little knowledge about what effect T has on fertility (after stopping). There have been FTM's who have gotten pregnant and had a healthy baby even after being 10 years on T. But there is no record of how many have tried for children but where unable to. And I think for something that is this important to me, I shouldn't risk it, right?

Being on T isn't a very high necessity for me anymore. All the changes have already happened. The only concern would be the reversible changes. Which would basically just be fat redistribution and muscle mass ^(^and ^orgasming, ^cough, ^cough.) 

Fat distribution won't make much difference for me, because I never really noticed a difference there in the first place (my body shape was already pretty androgynous, I think). Muscle mass would be a downer though. Because I really like the way that is now. I have so much more strength (and I really didn't do anything to get it). I'm also a bit worried about the latter one, because honestly I really hated masturbating before. And I'm not sure if its the accepting my femininity or the T that has changed that. And I'm worried of losing what I have now. I have also finally just started losing weight in the past few months (which is a huge thing for me, has basically never happened to me before and is much needed). So I'm also worried that I mess that up if I stop now, since woman gain weight more easily. And the last thing I'm worried about is my beard. I basically have a full-beard, but I have just a few spots that still need filling. And I'm worried that if I stop T now, that they'll never properly fill in. 

I'm also really not in a position to have children right now. I am not even seeing anyone. So I think it will be 2 more years at the very least before I even start trying. I'm really hoping to have my first child in less than 5 five years from now. Although I'm not sure how realistic that is.

So with all these things I would say that maybe the timing isn't right and I would be better off waiting a little longer. But the reason I don't want to wait is because I'm worried that if I keep going, it will damage my fertility. I'm especially worried that this sudden urge to have children is a sign I am going infertile. I haven't had my fertility tested, and honestly I am not going to because I don't want to go through that process. But again, if I want to have children so badly (and yes I really want them to be mine, so not by adoption), should I really put that at risk for those rather trivial things?

I take my T shots every 3 months, and my next shot was suppose to be 3 days ago so I don't have much time left to decide (being a few days late isn't a big deal). I've been trying to decide for the last 3 months but I haven't gotten any further in making a decision. Which is why I am writing this post. I was thinking of maybe stopping for a while to see if I am at least still able to get my period (I already got my period only once and never again when I switched from birth control to T, but that's probably because I was on birth control for so long. So I think it will take more than 3 months at the very least to get one again). But I think that once I do get my period, I'll still have the very same question on whether I should start again now or stay off. So I still would really like some advice.

I realize its probably mostly ""newbies"" here who are questioning if they are non-binary or just starting out with transitioning, and not a lot of people with a similar situation to mine.

2043,2019-07-31 03:19:52,ck2odl,0,9,"Heya~!

I wanted to wait a little bit before doing this because I just recently came out as trans to a few of my friends, and haven't yet come up with what I wanted to change my name to.

But after a lot of thinking, I think I've come up with something that I really like~

So hey guys, gals, and everything inbetween~ My name is Rea!

I'm 17 years old, I'm transgender MtF, and I am still mostly in the closet about both my gender, as well as my sexuality. (I'm bi~)

I am also an artist, and I'm planning on going to college for art sometime next year.

Anyway, on with my story.

So I didn't start to realize that something was posibly wrong with me until around 12 or 13, when I hit puberty. Everything that was happening just felt wrong to me, but I didn't quite understand why. I just assumed that ""this was a puberty thing,"" and probably everyone felt like this when it first starts happening.

Turns out though, that I was wrong.

Oh so very very wrong.

I didn't really know what to do about this at the time, so I kinda just ignored it, while at the same time absolutely hating literally every single part about my body. I mean who could blame me, I didn't even know what ""transgender"" was at the time.

it wasn't until a few years later, (last year to be exact) when I came across this youtube video that someone posted talking about their experience with growing up trans. Feeling bored, and having nothing else to watch, I decided to give it a click.

And watching it made me relate to them more than I think anything else ever had.

Immediately, I started doing a bit of research, looking up other people's experience, looking up different gender identities that I might actually be, and after thinking about it for a little bit, I started dobubting myself (which is something that I always do) and went back to just being a depressed cis guy, with no idea why he felt so terrible about the way he looked.

Over time, the thought of being trans came back to me, so for a while I decided to just go as non-binary, but that still felt wrong to me. During this time, I went to a 2 week summer camp, away from my siblings, my parents, and for the first time in my life, I opened up to people.

(and my ""opening up,"" I mean I told people I was bi, but I stayed quiet about being trans.)

Everytime I was called a guy I hated myself for not correcting them. But even then, I still had an amazing time at this camp, I made some really great friends, (two of which being trans themselves,) and after the camp ended, I messaged them on Instagram telling them the truth about my gender.

And obviously, (there wasn't even a question about it,) they were all extremely accepting.

they've been super supportive, and they even helped me come up with my new name. And so far, that's where my story ends.

I haven't come out to my family yet, but it's something that I really want to try and do before the end of this summer. And I really do hope that my family is just as accepting as my friends have been.",NonBinary,A greetings to all~ + my story (so far) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà,1564568392.0,"{'created_utc': 1564543192, 'id': 'ck2odl', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 9, 'selftext': 'Heya~!\n\nI wanted to wait a little bit before doing this because I just recently came out as trans to a few of my friends, and haven\'t yet come up with what I wanted to change my name to.\n\nBut after a lot of thinking, I think I\'ve come up with something that I really like~\n\nSo hey guys, gals, and everything inbetween~ My name is Rea!\n\nI\'m 17 years old, I\'m transgender MtF, and I am still mostly in the closet about both my gender, as well as my sexuality.

Well, lovelies, I posted last week about my intent to come out to my parents as enby (24 AFAB, they/them) during my visit. Here's the promised update: 

I came out to my mother early on in the week when she began talking unprompted about her struggles to use the singular ""they"" because grammar. I thought giving her a personal reason to try might help. She said all the right things in the moment, but made a real meal of the ""well, I might forget because I'm only human but it doesn't mean I'm transphobic, etc."" I was anticipating that. 

Then... she spent the rest of the week misgendering me dozens of times. Frankly, I don't know that she'd ever referenced my gender that much when she thought I was cis. The one time I (gently) corrected her, she had a whole meltdown about how she was trying and she warned me she'd mess up and... yeah. Basically, it was all about her and her feelings and I was a jerk for imposing this on her. 

I never got the chance to come out to my Dad. While I really think he would do (and want to do) better, and while in a lot of ways he would have been the easier parent, the whole thing with my mother really took the wind out of my sails. She has a long history of abusing and erasing my lived experience, and it was hard not to go back to those feelings.

Sadness that the NB friend whose coming out tipped the balance for me in the first place also prefers me to present my assigned gender.

Mourning losing the gender I never really had while at the same time deciding how much I want to perform it.

Feeling conflicted around my girlfriend not only for her preferences but for envying her more masculine personality, her ability to stay friends with guys.

Wanting to apologise for my near blanket preference towards guys, but also knowing it goes nowhere, and the preference is meaningless. I'm asexual. Being asexual meant I never made myself work through how I feel about women until now - I knew I didn't want to have sex with them, so I went through my life assuming straight.

Plus friendship was so nice. And no sex automatically, because they were women. It was nice to have a whole group 'written off' the sexual/relationship worry radar, problematic as that is.

Looking in the mirror and saying I feel like a gay guy and feeling utterly ridiculous and then closing my eyes and seeing the gay guy in my head saying I'm a straight woman also look ridiculous.

Knowing that my ideal body type is male ballerina but that on me that would look like butch woman. Even if I was effeminate dressing on top of a butch body type.

Wanting the opposite sex's body but not having the 'right' socialisation skills or preferences to go with it. And never wanting it 'enough', anyway.

Wondering if it would make sense to be a gay dude forever internally without any outward transition and if that is more or less insane sounding than saying I'm cis.

Maybe achieving something near to total androgyny would be perfection. Or maybe it would be just enough.

Or maybe I just have issues with being a lesbian and or a woman.

If I just want to please others above trying to be whatever it is I even am, then all I have to do is do nothing. Default cis. Default cis. Default cis.

3,2019-07-01 00:46:24,c7ly15,2,2,"I don‚Äôt really know if people post stories much on here, but I really want to just rant to people who might understand better than my family. 

I finally came out to both my parents as a trans male. I‚Äôve been out to my mom for over a year, my dad for a month. I figured since my dad had such a good reaction, and my mom had known about it so long, it was a good time to open up conversation about HRT, since it‚Äôs notorious for taking sometimes years to be accessible. When I brought it up very seriously and carefully with my mom, she refused to discuss it, only letting me know that ‚ÄúYou are not of an age where you can make that decision.‚Äù (I‚Äôm 16). My dad, on the other hand, brought it up in a series of questions on the way to my grandmother‚Äôs. They might have seemed too prying to some people, asking about my sexuality, about if I‚Äôm just a non-feminine woman, and then of course, asking about if I ever planned on transitioning medically. I always thought my dad would have my back on this, but when I told him about really wanting to peruse HRT now (to be educated on prices and start on the process), I saw him get tense and kind of make a noise in the back of his throat. He then went on a long rant, which included using things I had said to him in coming out, to tell me why I didn‚Äôt need to medically transition, and how I should just be happy with male clothes and haircut. He told me I shouldn‚Äôt worry about my main concern, my voice, and that I should just be happy like this (I wish dysphoria was that easy, lol). I described to him how it was less so that I‚Äôm upset about myself, and more so that I‚Äôm upset about how people see me, and that even in an accepting world, people are still going to misgender me, which hurts. He just continued to tell me about why I shouldn‚Äôt transition medically, such as telling me surgery is dangerous, also assuming that I would pursue bottom surgery. I told him the surgery I want to get (double mastectomy) has been around for a long enough time and been used enough that it should be safe, plus it doesn‚Äôt remove anything major, which was part of his concern for some reason. He told me I don‚Äôt need it because I‚Äôm flat chested (little does he know, I wear binders.) I didn‚Äôt know how to support the safeness of HRT, so he just further dismissed it. My dad, more or less, stopped talking about it because I burst into tears because I couldn‚Äôt explain to him my feelings, telling me he didn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äúcry in front of family.‚Äù

I know this isn‚Äôt a death sentence for me getting HRT, but it‚Äôs a good indicator that I‚Äôll be doing this on my own, when I‚Äôm 18+. I know many trans women and men transition later in life, and are just as valid as those who started in high school, and that there‚Äôs worse I could be facing, but it‚Äôs just so frustrating that they don‚Äôt understand how important it is to me.

I‚Äôve been out to my mom for over a year, my dad for a month. I figured since my dad had such a good reaction, and my mom had known about it so long, it was a good time to open up conversation about HRT, since it‚Äôs notorious for taking sometimes years to be accessible. When I brought it up very seriously and carefully with my mom, she refused to discuss it, only letting me know that ‚ÄúYou are not of an age where you can make that decision.‚Äù (I‚Äôm 16). My dad, on the other hand, brought it up in a series of questions on the way to my grandmother‚Äôs. They might have seemed too prying to some people, asking about my sexuality, about if I‚Äôm just a non-feminine woman, and then of course, asking about if I ever planned on transitioning medically. I always thought my dad would have my back on this, but when I told him about really wanting to peruse HRT now (to be educated on prices and start on the process), I saw him get tense and kind of make a noise in the back of his throat. He then went on a long rant, which included using things I had said to him in coming out, to tell me why I didn‚Äôt need to medically transition, and how I should just be happy with male clothes and haircut. He told me I shouldn‚Äôt worry about my main concern, my voice, and that I should just be happy like this (I wish dysphoria was that easy, lol). I described to him how it was less so that I‚Äôm upset about myself, and more so that I‚Äôm upset about how people see me, and that even in an accepting world, people are still going to misgender me, which hurts. He just continued to tell me about why I shouldn‚Äôt transition medically, such as telling me surgery is dangerous, also assuming that I would pursue bottom surgery. I told him the surgery I want to get (double mastectomy) has been around for a long enough time and been used enough that it should be safe, plus it doesn‚Äôt remove anything major, which was part of his concern for some reason. He told me I don‚Äôt need it because I‚Äôm flat chested (little does he know, I wear binders.) I didn‚Äôt know how to support the safeness of HRT, so he just further dismissed it. My dad, more or less, stopped talking about it because I burst into tears because I couldn‚Äôt explain to him my feelings, telling me he didn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äúcry in front of family.‚Äù\n\nI know this isn‚Äôt a death sentence for me getting HRT, but it‚Äôs a good indicator that I‚Äôll be doing this on my own, when I‚Äôm 18+. I know many trans women and men transition later in life, and are just as valid as those who started in high school, and that there‚Äôs worse I could be facing, but it‚Äôs just so frustrating that they don‚Äôt understand how important it is to me. \nIf anyone has any suggestions, or maybe stories, please feel free to leave a comment.

13,2019-07-01 03:35:36,c7nlps,1,0,"(this post might be a bit crude with sexual topics warning. sorry)

So this post is going to be unfiltered with my true feelings and emotions which is a rare thing for me to do and admit. I have a lot of things bottled up that not even my closest friends or family are aware of in the slightest. I feel like the next year is a critical year for my life journey and I don't want to get it wrong.

  
I'm 26 years old and have been male/identified as male all my life. I don't act feminine around my family in the slightest and don't really have any gay/trans friends. I love doing manly things like sports, roughing around with the fam, and trash talk and up until about 2 years ago never even considered the option of a transition. I have never had a girlfriend in my life, I had one stint in college that lasted 2 weeks with a girl but it didn't work out. I actually dont think I'm an unattractive person in the slightest, but I'm very insecure and unconfident especially around women because of the cycle of loneliness and fear of social awkwardness, and one more embarrassing thing which I will mention in the next paragraph. I feel very lonely, depressed, and hurt and if there was a button I could press to stop existing so that my family never knew I existed, I would press it now in an instant. But there's not. I feel like I have to make a change in my life, and I'm trying to decide if transitioning is the right move.

One of the reasons I lack confidence is because....to put it lightly.....my small.......appendage (chem chem). I didn't start ""stroking the rooster"" until around 16 because it was always too small for pleasure. Up until around 19, I thought I might have a micropenis (i know...everyone finds it funny but it makes me want to kill myself) and this led to further depression and suicidal thoughts. However, after doing some research, I'm not sure its quite small enough to be diagnosed as that. it grows to around 4 inches erect, and is around 1 inch soft (and sometimes feels like it doesn't even stick out). Like, I understand this is unpleasant to hear, but the first time I am admitting this, and I believe its a critical part of this post and reason why I might transition. People and therapists have asked me why I'm so depressed in the past  and I cannot tell them why...it's just too embarrassing. This fact has led me to seek alternate pleasures, and at 16, I started experimenting with anal play. I loved it to be honest, although I always still considered myself attracted to women.

  
Across the span of 5-6 years, my sexual interests now include Trans and cis-women (I think i used the correct term there - sorry this is all new to me). However, until recently I didn't realize how pleasurable it was to possibly act like a woman/trans. It feels right and really turns me on sexually. I have now crossdressed and the experience almost makes me blush thinking about it. On top of that, I feel like I could make a really cute/sexy girl, even with minimal HRT treatment. I may have gynecomastia already as some family/friends have noticed. The woman in my family have very large breasts (DD+) and my dad has low testosterone/high estrogen levels compared to the average man. I really feel like I may be happier as a woman, people would be attracted to me for once in my life and I might not be lonely. My (potentially) large breasts and sexiness would compensate for my small appendage.  I would even consider dating a man if I felt that feminine. 

Here's the kicker. I am questioning whether this is just some kinky pent up sexual frustration or a real avenue to pursue. When you all decided to be trans, what percentage of it was sexual in nature versus just another type of feeling. I feel guilty for doing it for the wrong reasons. After all, I would be happy as a man if I had a larger appendage, more hair, and no man boobs. Some of those factors could act as a benefit in transition. To be honest, I have no idea about how to go about getting HRT or how I would tell my parents, family, and friends. It would be the ultimate embarrassment and awkwardness of my nightmares and I would probably damage the true relationship with at least my dad even though he would probably accept it. It wouldn't be the same. I'm also afraid jobs wouldn't hire me and it would affect my career. My life is already in shambles and I need to figure it out. My career is going nowhere, I have no friends, I don't go out, I don't date or use dating apps, and I'm obsessed with the wrong things.

I have identified as male since I was 10-12 years old. Now (over 10years later) I have come to question my gender identity again some time after treatment. I'm leaning towards masculine non-binary as my presented gender, but I'm thinking about my thoughts on my breasts and genitalia.

I personally don't think I can be considered cisfemale after all this time living as a male and being bodily classified as nonbinary/something-between.

Friday 28th

On Friday I got my 1st haircut to trim my hair. It looked like a really bad mullet so I wanted to get it trimmed up in a way that looks decent and I can grow it out well. I made a appointment the day before. The hairdresser did a amazing job and I loved how it looked. Later in the day I went with my stepmom and one of my sisters to go shopping. We started with getting our eyebrows threaded. Even though it was my 1st time it wasn't so painful. After my face looked way better. We then went to a makeup store where the store associate helped me with makeup products and put some on me. I honestly couldn't believe I could look like that, and while I still don't think I was passable I still looked way better than like ever before lol. After that was shopping for clothes. I tried on a bunch of stuff and found out my shoulders aren't actually as large as I thought. I was getting weird looks from some people and some smiles from others. I ended up getting a decent amount of clothes. So while it definitely was a costly day it was well worth it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Saturday 29th

I was going to a family party (uncle and aunts anniversary) and really wanted to present somewhat. So I wore this pink flowy shirt and some styled torn up jeans. I wore a bra of course but didn't want to shock my extended family with the presence of boobs. This was the 1st time they had seen me in like 7 months and the 1st time they would see me after finding out I'm transitioning. Because of this I wore a androgynous zip up jacket I have had for a few years. While I did get a few weird looks from some of my aunt and uncles friends I really didn't care. My extended family ended up being super supportive even though they were more than a little bit shocked when they heard. I ended up shoeing one of my aunts pictures from the day before and she said ""You look amazing... omg it's like you were meant to be a girl!"" I still feel like I didn't pass in that picture but it still was an nice comment to receive.

I had plans to go to pride with my other sister who's only 2 years younger than me. She was planning on going with her boyfriend, her boyfriends friend, one of her friends and me if I would go. I wore a shirt and the jeans from the evening before. The shirts sleeves ended on my forearms and had a section displaying way more of my upper chest than I ever displayed before (no boobage was visible and I was wearing a bra. It was easy to tell I have boobs from the side or front of me because the shirt was stylized to be somewhat tight. We ended up watching a good amount of the parade even though it was insanely crowded. Once we actually got inside the party area we just walked around and saw some very interesting people in various states of dress or undress (I guess that is just how pride is lol).

I'm assigned female at birth and I never felt right living my life as a woman. The boarding school I was sent to didn't allow me to explore my sexuality or the issues I was having with my gender.

When I got home I got another therapist who was and is a lot better. I immediately started unpacking my gender dysphoria with her and was presenting as genderqueer a lot of the time. I initially wanted to do a partial transition with hormones but was told that was not possible. I remember crying to my therapist and was told that a lot of the things I wanted sounded like I was a man. I kind of just went with it because it sounded right at the time and I just wanted to get as far as possible from my experience as a woman.

Fast forward to now, I've been on testosterone for almost six years and got top surgery. I use he/him pronouns and I'm so much more comfortable with my body, my name, and my pronouns. All of that's fine. I no longer pack because I don't think I actually have bottom dysphoria.. I don't want bottom surgery and I almost feel like I packed because I felt like I was supposed to have bottom dysphoria because I felt lopsided. I've also been exploring my femininity because I no longer feel threatened by it. People definitely experience me as a man, which is better than being experienced as a woman but something still doesn't feel quite right about calling myself a man.. It feels like I was being pushed into the binary no matter who I asked for help, whether it was to be a woman or be a man. I've told my therapist a few times that it feels like at my core I don't identify with being a man and was wondering if I was nonbinary and was told there was no way I was nonbinary which was difficult to hear because it gave me no room to explore it with them.. and I think they feel that way because after transitioning, I look like a cisgender man.

This is something I'm definitely going to try to sit with and explore. I don't want to make any big decisions right now but it does seem like I've known for a long time that I have felt and do feel a bit of disconnect from identifying as a woman or a man.

###### **TRIGGER WARNING: BODY DYSPHORIA ‚Äî CLINICAL DESCRIPTIONS OF ANATOMY, TISSUE SHEDDING, AND CELLULAR BIOLOGY.**

***The Journey***

Adding a new, small, human addition to our family has not been as straightforward as it is for a number of cisgender, heterosexual couples. Why? I am a trans man who, personally, only felt comfortable with a limited number of options.

I remember when I started hormone treatments at the Howard Brown Health Center back in 2012. It was a two day process back then. Perhaps it still is. The first day, they gave me two sheets of paper with a long lost of the irreversible side-effects of beginning exogenous testosterone.

Here goes!  


1. What are most binders made of? Are they similar to over-bust corsets, or are they made of different materials? If so, what are they?   

2. What does a properly-fitting binder feel like? Are they supposed to be tight-fitting a restricting, or looser and comfortable?   

3. What are some common binding methods that are not recommended? I hear duct-tape and ace wraps are commonly used when people don't have access to proper binders. I want to avoid things that would do more harm than good in the long run.   

4. How long does it take to get used to the fit/feel of them? How long are you supposed to wear them on a daily basis?

So, I've fully accepted my transness and have am in talks with my therapist about options, which is funny because I've only had 3 sessions haha. I mean, I mostly accepted this was the case as pandora's box opened and there is no way of shutting it this time. But that's beside the point. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told my best friend, cis male, that I have ""Serious life things to talk about"" this sunday. He doesn't know whats up but knows that I've been super depressed for a long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I explained that I have always viewed myself as female, and when I view myself in the mirror, it gives me great distress.

To explain my transition as being caused by an autogynephilic fetish, you need to assume the following:

I at one point had a male gender identity, and view myself as male with a female gender identity.

I view my natal genitals as part of my own body.

When I imagine sexual situations that arouse me, my gender identity is a prime factor in my arousal.

That there is some mystical force that prevents me from feeling constant arousal since I constantly have a female gender identity, and view my body as female.

That orgasm removes my dysphoria.

That receiving my breast augmentation caused an increase in sexual arousal.

That I receive sexual arousal when looking forward to bottom surgery.

That I have somehow been in denial about all of the above for the entirety of my 26 years on Earth.

&amp;#x200B;

To explain my transition as being caused by a natural female gender identity that creates existential distress, you need to assume the following:

Trans identities are a biological identity that come with a sense of self that differs from what is physically present.

That's it.

I have always felt like I was born, wrong?
Like, for as long as I can remember I never really felt comfortable looking feminine. 
whether it be, clothes, hair, makeup, etc,
I always just feel, idk, icky? When I look like a girl.

And even though I have a very flat chest,
I still feel super, idk, gross? About it.
I wear a binder whenever I can,
And if I can't wear it that day I wear baggy clothing to hide my chest.

And I like being called they/them,
and i dont mind he/him,
but she/her makes me feel that weird gross feeling again. 

But the thing that gets me is,
I don't necessarily feel anything twords my, uh ""genital area""? 
Like, I don't particularly have good OR bad feelings twords it. 
Like, I don't exactly like what I have,
But I don't HATE it either,
I'm just, okay? With it. i guess? 

I hate the way I was born,
I hate my chest,
I hate how feminine I look,
I hate pretty much everything.

So aside from the strong possibility that breast enlargement creams won't work, if they do will they give me small breasts?

I don't really want large breasts, it just isn't my thing, so I'd honestly be ok with some breast enlargement if that's all they can do. If I could get an A cup sized pair of breasts that would be perfect (if I'm lucky maybe B sized breasts, but that probably pushing it). Now I don't expect these creams to work in a week, or in a month even, so if you're going to warn me that they take a while don't worry, I expect that.

There's also the matter of health relating to these creams. I've read that some of them actually use your hormones to have their effects and can possibly harm you if not supervised by a doctor. Now I myself am not in the position to see a doctor for hormone monitoring and on top of that it probably will cost me a lot so if it's true that they mess around with hormones then I don't think I'll take those untill I can talk to a therapist and decide weather or not hrt is an option.

Oh I should have probably mentioned this but right now I'm not in transition or anything yet, heck no one really knows I'm considering being trans yet. So that kinda explains why I can really go to a doctor yet. And yes I know if I get small breasts people will freak out, but if I get small breasts as a guy I can just wrap it around with the same thing that ftm guys use and say that their just man boobs.

212,2019-07-05 19:12:54,c9jwqy,3,0,"Long story short, I‚Äôm back on HRT after about a 6 year hiatus. Had a lot of things I had to overcome, like alcoholism and some childhood trauma, anxiety. 

I‚Äôve always been attracted to women only. I‚Äôve been girl crazy since day one. But also I wanted to be a girl since day one. I used to look at all the sale ads in my dad‚Äôs Saturday morning newspapers, from places like Target, and long for girls undies and cute clothes and felt very confused about myself and how I fit in the world... but also was big time compartmentalizing. Probably filed most of that under fetishisms but very much knew I wanted to be female. Dated girls all through my 20s and 30s, had some drunk sex with guys on the DL, was open about my gender stuff at various moments. I lived in New Orleans for 12 years and presented as fem for pretty much the whole time I lived there. Also I haven‚Äôt had sex since 2007. Last girlfriend was a lesbian. Since then didn‚Äôt have anyone on the radar. 

Anyway, here I am blossoming and being the most happiest I‚Äôve ever been, back on track, and I came out to everybody and just everything is really unfolding on so many levels. Life is getting good. 

A few days ago I microdosed some Molly as kind of a personal therapy session. I used it to really get into myself and have some quality alone time and love myself and play with clothes and makeup and music, feel sexy, pump up my girl vibes and totally embrace some things. At one point I started searching for hypno kinda positive affirmation fem stuff, and stumbled upon SISSY HYPNO PORN. Y‚Äôall! I‚Äôm dead. WTF?! I think it‚Äôs highly debatable that any of it actually has any true hypnotic effects on me but what it did do was expose a part of my sexuality, full on, that I was pretty much blind to. Like, I love cocks, I want cocks, it turns me on big time that men want me (something I kinda knew deep down but ignored)... it makes my guts quiver and makes me want to explode and turn into a total cock riding slut. The thing is though, I‚Äôm not attracted to men. I‚Äôm more attracted to trans girls than females these days because of so many reasons, and that led to me being totally turned on by cocks, trans cocks, but still. I didn‚Äôt see this coming.

And in the past, the few times I was with guys, I noticed that super aroused butterflies in my stomach feeling, but I thought it was just nervousness or that I was feeling different because being with a man made me feel super fem. Females and other queer gals and trans peeps never respond to my profile or dating posts, but then I get all these dudes with sex messages. Like duh, that‚Äôs a given, but yeah. Ive even mostly resented men most of my life and didn‚Äôt want to have much to do with them. So last night I indulged some of them with super dirty talk and I can‚Äôt tell you how much it made me feel like... such intense sexual energy. Like mind blowing. A pivotal moment I realized, given past experiences and what I‚Äôm realizing.  

So here I am going, wow, now what do I do? I guess I gotta figure out which guys I‚Äôm actually attracted to because most of them I am not. I don‚Äôt like facial hair or stubble, or hairy bodies, or man hands, or whatever but I can‚Äôt ignore this feeling I have. And I have to say the other positive side effect of these videos and these realizations, is that it helped me let go of some really old gender roles bullshit that has been stuck in my psyche, that made me feel shame because my brain was holding onto this small piece of male identity that totally didn‚Äôt serve me in anyway and was causing a lot of dysphoria and dissociation. Now I feel more realized as my feminine self. Not that that should have anything to do with cocks and traditional gender roles but hey whatever gets ya there.

About 3 months ago I met with an employer for a job on my campus. I told them that I would be able to start working in August as I wouldn't be able to stay in town. They were cool with this and just said to email them when I'm back in town.

About two months ago I started transitioning and plan to go full time around when the next  semester (August) starts.

I thought about mentioning it in the email mentioned above, but I don't know if I should or how I should even go about that. I feel like it would be weird to just throw in a ""btw I'm trans"" but it would also be weird to just show up and bring it up then.

I am a closeted trans person from Sweden. For my own sake, I won't go into what my biological gender is, I don't think it matters to the situation, since it's a general struggle. (My username won't help you guess, btw.)

I haven't reached out to the actual LGBT community for this yet, and have been dreading doing it for a while. But here I am. I need urgent help and support, both from the community and eventually therapy as well. Anyway.

I came out as trans to my family in 2013-2014, I was met with disrespect &amp; hate, so much that I eventually 'reverted' back and got stuck. I recently started feeling more dysphoric and miserable, due to Pride festivals/parades happening around me and family shutting me down for wanting to go. I've never been to or celebrated pride. They aren't forbidding it, I am allowed to go, but nobody wants to tag along. I want to come out, I want to transition before it's ""too late."" Though my NEED to transition is massive, I can't. I'm too afraid, I'm driven by what people will think of me, what my family will feel. FYI I am above 18, but I currently live with my mother and step-father until I begin 'college' (folkh√∂gskola) where I will be living at campus.

On to my story, I did come out before as I mentioned. I was greeted with my homophobic step-father belittling me, referring to me as ""it"" - instead of respecting my preferred pronouns. The times I passed in public and was called by my preferred pronouns he would correct the person talking. I was openly humiliated, in a ""fun and joking"" way, at home. I put up with it, some of which I didn't realise was actual bullying til years later. I had about 3 friends who accepted me at the time as well as my mother who was a bit on-and-off, but tried her best to help me (...silently judging me at times, which is honestly understandable.) I've identified as cis now, trying to fit in for years, but I've started to worry about my own health. Forcing myself to live as cis is taking it's toll on me. Seeing people of the opposite gender reminds me of what I can never have, seeing trans people who are far into on their journey upsets me. Deeply. I keep thinking it won't ever be me. I'm so insecure, and with bottled up transphobia (towards myself) it's even harder. I used to harm myself by restricting my eating, self harm, the usual stuff. Today I keep coming back to suicide as an option, like I'll be starting over or something - I see it as finally finding my peace, getting rid of all worries &amp; saving my family the trouble. It's not necessarily in a ""depressive"" way. (I don't need any suicide hotline numbers, believe me, there is no need to worry about that, I'll get into therapy as soon as school begins to help with that.) There is so much hindering me... What will my homophobic grandmother &amp; step-father think? How will my mother feel? Will I disappoint everybody? Ruin the relationships I have with everybody? And no, I will never just ignore what my family thinks or go against their will too blatantly, even though I'm legal. I care about them very much.

https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/billy-porter-dress-oscars-2019.jpg

I had all the pieces to make the outfit, but when the week came to put it together I just... didn't.  I mean she knows I'm trans, she's like one of three people who know. But I'm not out, and we haven't talked about me wearing it since before her engagement and before she even picked a day.

So todays the day. My son (7), bless him wants to wear a dress and I got him one that matches his mother. They look beautiful together. I however, have a regular suit and tie that matches my wife's outfit and I'm staring at it just wondering what I'm doing.

I got about 3 hours before we head off to the wedding, and it's not enough time to put together the outfit, even hapassardly. Crinoline is terrible to work with, let alone in a rush. 

I know today is about her, she won't even remember I'm sure about the outfit choice. But I cant help but feel like if she does remember it'll be a disappointment, and that on top of it I'm really disappointing myself.

I mean, I'm a month into HRT and I still can't get up the courage to just tell people, and be myself.

270,2019-07-06 19:44:23,c9xqqp,2,6,"K, so, I‚Äôm 17 now. I‚Äôm more mature and less cringed now but here‚Äôs my life:

As a kid, I would always pretend to be male characters (with the exception of 1 character at age 2 and 1 genderless/female character at age 13. I would like to pretend I was a boy and I‚Äôd like people to call me by these characters‚Äô names. Still, I didn‚Äôt feel like ‚ÄúI am not a girl‚Äù or anything.

At age 13, I began to create online profiles to roleplay as fictional characters, always male. Sometimes I‚Äôd make ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù accounts where I‚Äôd seek naming inspirations from them to come up with boys names I thought was cool, and put he/him in my bio. I would tie my hair back in photos, and cut it shoulder length so I could look more boyish. So I would pretend to be a boy but still, in real life, didn‚Äôt think I was one. 

Leaning about puberty, I was silly in sex ed because I was kinda secretly grossed out as I didn‚Äôt want to grow female parts. I identified as asexual at this age, and did until I realised at the age of 16 that I can‚Äôt be asexual since I get turned on and want to have a partner but I still find it hard now, at 17, to know if I truly like someone. Maybe I‚Äôm aromantic or maybe I‚Äôm just too insecure.

I always dressed emo because I like how black hid all my body. I was chubby (NOT how overweight or obese people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm chubby xD‚Äù I was DEFINITELY healthy but being chubby with an underweight sister made my dad call me fat (he now retracts his statements since he realises she isn‚Äôt what healthy is) and messed me up in the head so I became anorexic lol love that for me. I still went by male online, and now started going as male full time, looking at boy thinspo rather than girl ones. I also HATE my chest and began to bind, which my parents are aware of

I began exploring different aesthetics when I felt thin and my body and looks were seen as attractive, getting quite a lot of followers fans and money online and I found a cute pastel aesthetic that I‚Äôd wear. I tried to not hide my chest to feel more comfortable looking girlish but online I‚Äôd still hide it since I told people I was just a feminine boy (??? I‚Äôm not that that feminine and never have been so idk what tf that phase was about) and yEAH so I started dressing emo again because I felt like I was too girly then, and I still liked the colours but it made me feel all bad

I IDed as Male full time online and told one of my online friends I was trans when she seemed confused and asked my pronouns. I‚Äôve known her for 7 months, IDing as ftm consistently. I now bind my chest and have chin length hair (it‚Äôs not that masc but I‚Äôd like boy hair and to be perceived as a boy) and dress in baggy clothes BUT still want to dress in my colourful 90s aesthetic without feeling like I have to force myself to be feminine or a girl just cus I wear colours :)

Still even though I want a flat chest, dick, to be a BOY and called HE, sometimes I feel bad since I‚Äôm not super masculine (I like bright colours and I‚Äôm kinda sensitive) but I‚Äôm not feminine either I don‚Äôt wear makeup or skirts!! I DONT think I‚Äôm nonbinary though I don‚Äôt wanna be called they them

273,2019-07-06 20:45:39,c9yfkn,2,7,"So, some small backstory.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently in the hospital, overcoming some nasty wounds I sustained in an accident. On Saturdays, they take me for a shower, and before they did, I got to see myself nude in the mirror.

&amp;#x200B;

I was shocked. I was shocked at how feminine my body looked. How my hips now curve away from my waist, how my breasts sit high and proud on my chest. At how my thighs were lush and curved. I am a lucky trans-woman in many ways, as I was born with a naturally feminine bone-shape; but I was mostly amazed at what the hormones had done.

&amp;#x200B;

Without a doubt, I have a woman's body shape. I feel so extraordinarily lucky, so happy, and so fulfilled that I decided to transition. I saw my entire body as attractive for the first time in my life, and that was amazing to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I normally do not post about positivity, but I felt the need to here. For transgender people not on hormones yet, let this be a lesson. They do work. They do destroy body disphoria. They can often get you results that you will not just find serviceable, but make you happy.

&amp;#x200B;

As of right now, I am beyond overjoyed. I'm only two-and-a-half years in, and there is more to come. This staggers me, and brings me joy that I have not had for years.

&amp;#x200B;

You can do it my transgender siblings. You can, because you are brave, you are determined, and you don't let what society tells you is wrong deter you. You are all amazing people, and I am thrilled to have found myself in a community of brothers and sisters.

275,2019-07-06 21:13:09,c9yqzs,1,0,"Some people seem to think that discrimination towards Trans folx is exaggerated.
People like to say everyone has to deal with discrimination and/or injustice which are true.  Even cis white hetero males face problems in the world. Income equality has only gotten worse and worse since the 80's and automation has continued to eliminate jobs. Employers would rather hire someone willing to work horrible hours and horrible conditions with poor benefits and as little pay as possible rather than someone who is computer literate. And unions that do exist typically just want to make money for themselves rather than better conditions for workers. Crap like this has left blue collar workers in the dust and uncertain futures lead to a lot of fear and anxiety.
Cis women face these issues as well with added layers. On average women earn more degrees than men, bachelor, master and doctorate degrees. Even with that though some statistics show women earn 80% of what men make. You can also add sexual harassment to the list as well, for every 100 women 81 of them have been sexually harassed in their life whether it be verbal or physical.  38 of those women dealt with it in the workplace especially those in the service industry, typically ones where their income partially comes from tips. Women typically get overlooked for promotions when competing with male counterparts, especially women if color. 1 in 6 women have been victims of sexual violence. Pregnancy rate is 5% per rape among victims of reproductive age. 7% of pregnant women were asked to resign from their jobs. 59% of women seeking abortions are already mothers. And yet these women are being hit with bans and persecution for wanting or having abortions.
Trans folx also face most and sometimes all of the things listed above for both men and women with even more layers than that. Front and foremost is a lack in legal protections whether it be housing, employment, education, medical care or even in some states just using public restrooms.  I myself have faced discrimination in medical care with my own primary care doctor that I had seen since i was a teenager. He said he couldn't help me with some my medical needs and couldn't and wouldn't help me with a recommendation. At a point he asked me, ""Why are you even coming here anymore?"" I experienced discrimination in employment as well.  I was fired for trumped up BS shortly after I came out as trans at a previous job. 
Another major and common hurdle for Trans folks is poverty, due to once again lack of legal protection in unemployment. Why would a company retain or hire a Trans individual when they don't have too, the company would face less complaints from bigoted coworkers and customers if they just hire a cis applicant.  Trans folx tend to feel like they need to perform at sometimes unattainable levels of perfection (for their employers) to retain enough credibility to keep the job they have, let alone trying to attain promotions or seeking other jobs.  Poverty and/or unemployment can lead to homelessness which most people understand can lead to underground economies such as drug sales and survival sex work, adding to that even some homeless shelters have been shown to discriminate against Trans folx. 
Some of the discrimination is born from stigmatization like Trans folx being called mentally ill, deviants or sex predators. Even some gay men have criticized Trans folx as an embarrassment and think that T shouldn‚Äôt be included in LGB because it makes them look bad or delegitimizes them.  Then there are Trans exclusionary radical feminist that call Trans women TIMs(Trans Identifying Men) and Trans men are called confused lesbians or female betrayers. The rise in white nationalism has led to even more hate for Trans folx as well. Some people that were on the fence and didn't care can sometimes fall into radicalization by hate groups and become violent towards Trans folx and many other minorities. These types of things and many more, can lead to lot violence towards the community. Just in the last 6 months there have been at least 11 transgender people fatally shot or killed this year.  Last year it was 23.  These numbers are believed to be under reported and also don't include the countless physical assaults or beatings endured.  I can't go two weeks without seeing another beating on my news feed.  And still those are only the ones that are reported.
Working our way to the most marginalized are Trans women of color or even non binary people of color, we see most and possibly all of the issues listed above and yet still more layers that come with racial inequality. Poverty (again), housing discrimination (again), Increased incarceration rates sometimes due to racial profiling (which can also lead to even more strife and even death if placed in the wrong prison, according to gender, or even in general population) 60% of those imprisoned are POC, Medical care access due to poverty and being uninsured, this list is long and not nearly everything is listed. Of those 11 Trans folx shot so far this year, all of them were POC. Most, but not all, of the physical assault and beatings that I have seen or read about are POC.
I have heard Trans women of color described as the canary in the coal mine and as diminishing as that sound it hits a certain cord.  When the world ignores the most marginalized the marginalized are silenced and are not there to help those that remain, when hatred for others tastes blood it doesn't usually stop after the first bite.
Most of everything I have talked about here has only really just begun to scratch the surface but the take away from all this is, I believe, if you dig through all the layers down to the most marginalized and fight for their equality than in essence you fight for everyone‚Äôs equality.  At the very least I hope someone reading this will be able to admire the bravery of Trans POC and can develop respect what Trans POC go through just to exist in this world.
#EqualityForAll #BlackTransLivesMatter",trans,Rambling post about equality...I had alot on my mind today...,1562472789.0,"{'created_utc': 1562447589, 'id': 'c9yqzs', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'Some people seem to think that discrimination towards Trans folx is exaggerated.\nPeople like to say everyone has to deal with discrimination and/or injustice which are true.  Even cis white hetero males face problems in the world. Income equality has only gotten worse and worse since the 80\'s and automation has continued to eliminate jobs. Employers would rather hire someone willing to work horrible hours and horrible conditions with poor benefits and as little pay as possible rather than someone who is computer literate. And unions that do exist typically just want to make money for themselves rather than better conditions for workers. Crap like this has left blue collar workers in the dust and uncertain futures lead to a lot of fear and anxiety.\nCis women face these issues as well with added layers. On average women earn more degrees than men, bachelor, master and doctorate degrees. Even with that though some statistics show women earn 80% of what men make. You can also add sexual harassment to the list as well, for every 100 women 81 of them have been sexually harassed in their life whether it be verbal or physical.  38 of those women dealt with it in the workplace especially those in the service industry, typically ones where their income partially comes from tips. Women typically get overlooked for promotions when competing with male counterparts, especially women if color. 1 in 6 women have been victims of sexual violence. Pregnancy rate is 5% per rape among victims of reproductive age. 7% of pregnant women were asked to resign from their jobs. 59% of women seeking abortions are already mothers. And yet these women are being hit with bans and persecution for wanting or having abortions.\nTrans folx also face most and sometimes all of the things listed above for both men and women with even more layers than that. Front and foremost is a lack in legal protections whether it be housing, employment, education, medical care or even in some states just using public restrooms.  I myself have faced discrimination in medical care with my own primary care doctor that I had seen since i was a teenager. He said he couldn\'t help me with some my medical needs and couldn\'t and wouldn\'t help me with a recommendation. At a point he asked me, ""Why are you even coming here anymore?"" I experienced discrimination in employment as well.  I was fired for trumped up BS shortly after I came out as trans at a previous job. \nAnother major and common hurdle for Trans folks is poverty, due to once again lack of legal protection in unemployment.

Takes T every 2 weeks. Okay. So, he has been having menstrual cramps without periods, rather often. The trans community basically told him that its his uterus basically saying.. ""Hey! I still here!!"" And suggested he stop taking T till he has a period. So he did just that. This was about...a month ago. He has been..kinda different lately, and I noted it..okay? Like, more short with people or..more indifferent. He noted that when he was a woman, he was a asshole. Like, a total asshole and T mellowed that out. Okay. So (and like ai said, you can read my recent post) we had a minor fight and he said he wanted a divorce. I mean, he gave his reasons, got emotional, etc. I told him...it honestly might be his hormones being all funked up and he said he would see, but didn't think it could possibly be that. After, he went on a solo camping trip for a day.

My legal name is Kasey, but I absolutely hate that name. I don't  **FEEL** like a Kasey, and I never have. I internally cringe everytime I get called that. I've ALWAYS felt like a (insert my middle name here). It feels right, it feels good, it feels like ME. And Kasey never has. (I know being trans gendered is much harder. I know for certain that I have not going through anywhere near the struggles someone in the trans community has. This is just how I really feel and I wanted to explain that.)

I'm FINALLY getting to legally change my name after moving to another state where it no longer costs $400 with a mountain of paperwork (SC for the lose, VA for the win!). I'm changing my name to my middle name so that I can finally feel like me. Since I don't like Kasey I'm not going to make it my middle name, but this leaves me without one.  I've been looking at baby name sites to try to find a new one, but I've been hit with ""choice exhaustion"" so to speak.

Any advice on how to pick the perfect name for me?

387,2019-07-09 13:46:31,cb137a,5,3,"So I've been trying to come out for like, the past 3 years. I've finally decided on a letter! Think this is good?


""Hello to all those who receive this. 
This is not easy to say in person, which I have been trying to do for 3 years now. I've decided to write a letter instead, so here we go. 

All my life I have been a 'tomboy' I guess you could say. Never liked wearing dresses or skirts, never wore makeup, the only remotely 'feminine' thing I ever liked were teddies. Around the age of 13 it all made sense to me, however, when I discovered the LGBT community. 

I found it through a friend I had made, and I have to thank them for it, because otherwise this would be happening a lot later in life. Thanks to them, I discovered myself. I realised that my childhood made sense, and I wasnt just that weird little girl that wasnt very girly. Thanks to that friend I also went through a few names back then too. Thankfully they didnt stick and I found a better one. 


The thing is, I always thought I was just ""too shy to wear a skirt"" and that wearing one or even putting on make up made me uncomfortable because ""I was too shy and worried what people would say"". That's partially right, but probably not because I was shy. Sure, I WAS shy, but that's not exactly why I didnt like wearing skirts and makeup. 
While I did wear one throughout year 7, and the fact that I wore a dress on holiday for that fancy night, it was mainly to try and be more feminine. To try and convince myself that I was feminine. It didnt exactly work. 
While I do really love the cruise dress, I didnt feel too comfortable in it. I felt dysphoria. Flashback to prom: that anxiety attack I had before leaving the house was due to dysphoria. I felt incredibly distressed from wearing a dress and make up and looking 'girly' and it made me panic. I didnt realise it at the time, but it was dysphoria*. 
*There will be a link to explain dysphoria. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is: 3 years ago, I realised that I am transgender. All of the things that I felt didnt make sense, the being a 'tomboy' and trying to act feminine to at least FEEL like I wasnt weird, it makes sense. 
3 years ago I realised that what I felt was the sense of being in the wrong body. All these years, I just thought I was a tomboy. All these years, the anxiety and 'shyness' I felt was due to not being in the right body and feeling dysphoric and distressed over it. 

I'm basically writing this so you will have time to react. If I said this in person I definitely wouldnt make sense, but writing it down does and I need to say it sooner or later. So, there you go. I'm transgender, and I would like you all to call me Kai from now on. Since it has been 3 years and I am still feeling like this, I think it's safe to say that this feeling will not go away any time soon. 
So, what does this mean to family, friends, etc? 
Well, as for family, you have a new son/brother now. I know it may take time to get used to it, but I know you will. For friends, I'm the same person, just different gender. 

I know it may take time to get used to, and I know this may be hard to comprehend. Mum, you did NOT raise me wrong, in fact you raised me well. The anxiety is not your fault, that is probably in part due to the dysphoria to be honest. None of this is because of you. It's all due to my own brain. The whole family has been great my whole life. This is not because of anyone and I really hope everyone understands that.

I\'ve decided to write a letter instead, so here we go. \n\nAll my life I have been a \'tomboy\' I guess you could say. Never liked wearing dresses or skirts, never wore makeup, the only remotely \'feminine\' thing I ever liked were teddies. Around the age of 13 it all made sense to me, however, when I discovered the LGBT community. \n\nI found it through a friend I had made, and I have to thank them for it, because otherwise this would be happening a lot later in life. Thanks to them, I discovered myself. I realised that my childhood made sense, and I wasnt just that weird little girl that wasnt very girly. Thanks to that friend I also went through a few names back then too. Thankfully they didnt stick and I found a better one. \n\n\nThe thing is, I always thought I was just ""too shy to wear a skirt"" and that wearing one or even putting on make up made me uncomfortable because ""I was too shy and worried what people would say"". That\'s partially right, but probably not because I was shy. Sure, I WAS shy, but that\'s not exactly why I didnt like wearing skirts and makeup. \nWhile I did wear one throughout year 7, and the fact that I wore a dress on holiday for that fancy night, it was mainly to try and be more feminine.

I'm a woman and generally pretty damn woman-like, big chest, hips etc. Relatively I've always liked being how I was born and the fact I was a woman but I've always been generally different, always a tomboy and always very spunky, I was raised by my punk dad mostly so it wore on me, I always fit better with guys then gals, etc. Its not exactly a different story from some other women who great up as a big tomboy.

I currently identify as a male. I say currently, because identities can change, and I went through a few before I found one I actually felt comfortable with (male with he/him/his pronouns)

There are a few things that have been plaguing me recently. The first; my friends.

I love them dearly with all my heart, but they‚Äôre all girls since I can‚Äôt branch out and have male friends. They don‚Äôt see me as a dude, and in their eyes, I‚Äôm still a girl cause I grew up with most of them. So, obviously I love my friends, and I truly do feel like a male, but sometimes I wonder if i‚Äôll ever be accepted as a male instead of a girl dressed like a dude. My plans are to go to a college a bit far away, and somewhere that not a lot of people from school are going so I can make new friends. 

The second problem, is that sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm faking it. I don‚Äôt like my body, for the obvious reasons, but also I hate how big my thighs are, and my stomach flabs, and my second chin that comes out of hiding when I look down. Like, I‚Äôm not *huge* but sometimes I feel like I am. Ok, but back to the main reason I think I‚Äôm faking it. Sometimes, on my good days where I can get into the shower without wanting to bawl my eyes out at the sight, I wonder if I‚Äôm just self-conscious of my body. But, when Im having one of my bad days, im like ‚Äúit‚Äôs so obvious! I hate the female parts, and just desperately want to be accepted as a male!! Why do I question it??!‚Äù

The third, is my parents. Like, I came out to my mom multiple times, because of the ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm this‚Äù and the ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm that‚Äù and when I told her I was trans, she was just as accepting as the other times. But I needed to tell her again a few months later to confirm that, yes, this is still how I feel. She was accepting like every other time. Then, I came out to my dad, while my mom was in the room. My thinking with that was ‚ÄúI‚Äôve come out to her like four times, it will probably get easier‚Äù spoiler; it wasn‚Äôt. So I‚Äôm bawling, trying to explain it, and my dad says something to the degree of ‚Äúbut /why/??? How do you know?? Are you sure this isn‚Äôt just a phase??‚Äù I tried to explain it, but I wouldn‚Äôt put it into words. I just kind of k n e w, if you know what I mean.

My mom brought up ‚Äúoh you don‚Äôt really like the same things as boys! Like sports, or other things like those, and you kind of gravitate towards the girls at school!‚Äù And I was just like, yes,, MOTHER! I gravitate towards the girls because the boys don‚Äôt like me. And I do like the things guys do. If you had let me, I would be watching ice hockey with my friends. I would be playing ice hockey if I could skate. I would be watching and playing basketball, and street hockey. I would love sports if I didn‚Äôt feel so alienated while playing. The boys think I‚Äôm no good, because again, the see me as the girl they grew up with. 

Another thing with my parents, is that even though they‚Äôre accepting, and they showed me support, it‚Äôs still ‚Äúhey, (deadname)! Can you throw this out please?‚Äù Or ‚Äúoh, my daughter is amazing! She‚Äôs the best!‚Äù Like that alone, around the house would already make me feel sooo much more immensely valid, but nope! Because I couldn‚Äôt explain my gut feeling, I‚Äôm still your lovely she-daughter. 

My last problem, is that I don‚Äôt have a binder. So whilst I go by my name instead of my dead name, my pronouns instead of female pronouns, and I mostly look like a male, I still have fucking breasts!! No thank you! That would help me so much freaking more than that one kid jerry I never speak to respecting my pronouns and name. I would take a binder over that any day of the week. 

Sorry that this is long, but finding a bunch of people I can relate to, and could possibly help me with this inspired the word-vomit.

I say currently, because identities can change, and I went through a few before I found one I actually felt comfortable with (male with he/him/his pronouns)\n\nThere are a few things that have been plaguing me recently. The first; my friends.\n\nI love them dearly with all my heart, but they‚Äôre all girls since I can‚Äôt branch out and have male friends. They don‚Äôt see me as a dude, and in their eyes, I‚Äôm still a girl cause I grew up with most of them. So, obviously I love my friends, and I truly do feel like a male, but sometimes I wonder if i‚Äôll ever be accepted as a male instead of a girl dressed like a dude. My plans are to go to a college a bit far away, and somewhere that not a lot of people from school are going so I can make new friends. \n\nThe second problem, is that sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm faking it. I don‚Äôt like my body, for the obvious reasons, but also I hate how big my thighs are, and my stomach flabs, and my second chin that comes out of hiding when I look down. Like, I‚Äôm not *huge* but sometimes I feel like I am. Ok, but back to the main reason I think I‚Äôm faking it. Sometimes, on my good days where I can get into the shower without wanting to bawl my eyes out at the sight, I wonder if I‚Äôm just self-conscious of my body.

I also have respect (or want to show as much respect as I can), human to human for trans people and anyone who is a part of he LGBTQ community. I don‚Äôt believe this fantasy makes me gay (not that it‚Äôs a bad thing), but I don‚Äôt identify as gay as I am not attracted to men, and do not believe that trans girls are men. I imagine trans people, or any LGBTQ supporter for that matter would also agree with me, yes?

Ok, now this is a strange subject for me but it is something I want to have a conversation about. I apologize in advance if anything I say isn‚Äôt politically correct, and am totally open to being corrected about anything I say in this post. Im just curious to hear how a trans girl would think about it.

So I have a hard time with the fact that this is a fantasy of mine. I have a hard time with the duality that‚Äôs presented by having this fantasy. On one hand, I always mean well. But on the other hand, from what I understand (or assume, rather) is that my very act of having the surface level desire of hooking up with a trans girl in and of its self is self defeating and insensitive towards a trans person. Is this true?

For example: this fantasy exists, but I am afraid of what people around me would think if they saw me spending time with a trans person. Or if someone found out that I had a sexual encounter with a trans girl. 

I also wouldn‚Äôt feel right in the sexual encounter if I wasn‚Äôt also willing to also accept being seen in public, unlesss I knew the girl I was with understood the situation. It just wouldn‚Äôt be right. Yet the fantasy still exists. I want to experience being with a trans girl.

In all honesty, It makes me feel cowardly, the fact that Im open to the sexual aspect but not the societal aspect of it. I‚Äôd like to be able to have a one night stand with a trans girl just the way I would with a biological female, but it doesn‚Äôt seem possible when that stigma is attached to it. 

I wish it could be taken in a positive light, but I assume that fetishizing your situation of being the right mind in the wrong body or vice/verse is wrong and I imagine it‚Äôs a touchy subject for trans people? I want it to be ok... but I feel like from a trans girls perspective it‚Äôd be easy to say ‚Äúso what, am I some kind of experiment for you to fuck?‚Äù

Which I would hate for it to be taken that way, but could totally see why it would.

Can someone chime in and help clear this up for me? Am I a monster just for having the desire? Is it acceptable or unacceptable to desire the sexual encounter but be scared of what my peer group would think of me?

Is there an understanding form the trans community about this subject that is different than what I‚Äôve described here?

But on the other hand, from what I understand (or assume, rather) is that my very act of having the surface level desire of hooking up with a trans girl in and of its self is self defeating and insensitive towards a trans person. Is this true?\n\nFor example: this fantasy exists, but I am afraid of what people around me would think if they saw me spending time with a trans person. Or if someone found out that I had a sexual encounter with a trans girl. \n\nI also wouldn‚Äôt feel right in the sexual encounter if I wasn‚Äôt also willing to also accept being seen in public, unlesss I knew the girl I was with understood the situation. It just wouldn‚Äôt be right. Yet the fantasy still exists. I want to experience being with a trans girl.\n\nIn all honesty, It makes me feel cowardly, the fact that Im open to the sexual aspect but not the societal aspect of it. I‚Äôd like to be able to have a one night stand with a trans girl just the way I would with a biological female, but it doesn‚Äôt seem possible when that stigma is attached to it. \n\nI wish it could be taken in a positive light, but I assume that fetishizing your situation of being the right mind in the wrong body or vice/verse is wrong and I imagine it‚Äôs a touchy subject for trans people? I want it to be ok... but I feel like from a trans girls perspective it‚Äôd be easy to say ‚Äúso what, am I some kind of experiment for you to fuck?‚Äù\n\nWhich I would hate for it to be taken that way, but could totally see why it would.\n\nCan someone chime in and help clear this up for me? Am I a monster just for having the desire? Is it acceptable or unacceptable to desire the sexual encounter but be scared of what my peer group would think of me?\n\nIs there an understanding form the trans community about this subject that is different than what I‚Äôve described here?\n\nCurious. And again sorry if I said the wrong thing. I mean well 100%!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Trans fantasy issues. Help?', 'created': 1562764064.0}"

441,2019-07-10 17:47:01,cbjw3c,6,2,"Hai! I don't entirely know if this is the subreddit for this but I figured I would post this here but feel free to reffer me to somewhere else if this dosent go here.  


Hey. So I've always been a very feminine male, assigned male at birth and really always been fine with it never thinking I would question my own gender  the past 6 months I've really actually started having doubts and struggles about my gender identity, at first it was moreso doubts and questions rather than any real struggling.  
I had my crush over (who is a guy and I'm assigned male at birth myself) who knows quite a bit more about gender and LGBTQ+ stuff than I did despite me being gay (finding men and masculinity attractive) and it organically turned into him reffering to me femininely and calling me girl when we were having fun and such.  
It honestly just felt so right and I got like a warm fuzzy butterflies in your tummy kind of feeling whenever he called me feminine pronouns and reffering to me in that way and it just felt right really.  


So after he went home after the weekend had ended we texted and stuff like usual. Until yesterday where it started coming into conversation again because I changed my Discord name to Sandy (i've always been called Sander online) because I kinda wanted to try it and experiment a bit with it since I had such a good experience.  
We talked about it and (since we both love DnD and Warcraft and I still play World of Warcraft avidly) we went to talking about female characters that you make yourself, and how ever since I was little I really felt uncomfortable and put off by playing female characters that I made, I've always been fine with playing characters that already were created as female (Lara Croft is one of my favourite video game characters of all time) but I always felt put off when I tried making a female character for myself and stuff like that.  
He suggested why not try it now, since I said it had been YEARS since I last tried making a female character somewhere in my early to mid teens probably (I'm 22 now), and it wouldnt hurt trying making one now on World of Warcraft for example since I could always delete it if I didn't like the animations and the feeling of playing my own female character as much as my male characters.  


So I tried making a female dwarf (dwarves are probs my fave fantasy race) and I basically got the biggest rush, actually feeling good about playing a female character and loving the animations on the dwarf animation rig and such, basically something I've really NEVER felt before it was euphoric. After having just run around checking the voice lines and animations on that character I went to my main, a male dwarf, and played him and I immideatly felt completely the same way as I had about playing female characters I had made ever since I was little. It felt so off putting and uncomfortable, that great big beard didn't fit me anymore where as this monday I could've played him fine no problem and now it felt completely wrong actually playing him as I had made him just a few months ago. I legit couldnt stop just tripping over my words in idek what that emotion was but I was absolutely euphoric. I talked to my crush about it and he explained that it's called Gender Euphoria, which I didn't know was a thing since I'd only ever heard of Gender Dysphoria, and that it's really normal to feel for people who discover something good or are having good experiences about their gender identity, like wearing clothes you really identify with and such. I remembered the EXACT same feeling when I wore makeup for the first time back in early 2017 and I never looked back from that, I'd always wanted to wear makeup and a friend gave me the last little friendly nudge to get me to buy some makeup I was looking at.  


I basically kept having question fly around my head since yesterday like ""Am I really a girl?"" and stuff akin to that and I basically just ended yesterday on that euphoric high more or less, I just felt so happy and content and it felt right.  


Today I think I experienced Gender Dysphoria for the first time on my own body and mind. After all that's been happening over the weekend and yesterday and not having needed to go for groceries and really leave my appartment or balcony that much into public view, I went to the grocery store and a petshot to buy my cat a new collar since the last one broke. On the way there a voice very akin to the one that starts berrating me when my depression has been really bad ever since I was a child, started questioning me and doubting me and halfway berrating everything that I'd felt and been happy and content about over the weekend and yesterday. Saying stuff like ""But you were born a boy, and you don't even really know if you're a girl at all."" and ""Women are weak, you wouldn't want to be weak and bullied like when you were a child again would you?"" and things like that. When we finally got to the shop I actually felt physically dimscomfortable with looking the way I did going into the shops, I wore a feminine cardigan and a t-shirt, black jeans and boots, something I legit wear everyday and absolutely feel fine in and love that type of outfit and have done so for the past 2 to nearly 3 years. I'd never felt uncomfortable in that way before, being uncomfortable in my own body and scared people were looking at me even though I was wearing and looking like I have done for many years and feeling absolutely fine about it through all those years and loving the style and wardrobe I've created for myself. It was legit one of the most horrible things I'd ever experienced, I'd experienced feeling uncomfortable and sad in my own skin but NEVER to this extent or this level and in this specific way before.

&amp;#x200B;

I went home and layed in bed and started to cry still having that voice berrate and question me inside my head and before falling asleep into a long nap the last thing I can really remember thinking conciously was ""I think I might be a girl...""   
I've never experienced anything on this scope and scale about my own gender identity before, I'd gone my entire life feeling just fine with assigning myself as male and I've never been unhappy with my genitalia and I'm still not, but I don't really feel like just a feminine guy anymore but not entirely a girl either, at least not yet? And in hindsight I think this is something that's always been stirring in me since I was a child but that I'd always repressed it as a survival mechanism having grown up in a broken home with a psychopatic and alcoholic father. I have so many questions and doubts and I just don't really know where I am or how I stand in terms of my own identity anymore. I hope this wall of text isn't too much for anyone to read in here and hopefully someone might be able to help me, I looked at all of your different picture posts in here and you're all so gorgeous and brave.

I remembered the EXACT same feeling when I wore makeup for the first time back in early 2017 and I never looked back from that, I\'d always wanted to wear makeup and a friend gave me the last little friendly nudge to get me to buy some makeup I was looking at.  \n\n\nI basically kept having question fly around my head since yesterday like ""Am I really a girl?"" and stuff akin to that and I basically just ended yesterday on that euphoric high more or less, I just felt so happy and content and it felt right.  \n\n\nToday I think I experienced Gender Dysphoria for the first time on my own body and mind. After all that\'s been happening over the weekend and yesterday and not having needed to go for groceries and really leave my appartment or balcony that much into public view, I went to the grocery store and a petshot to buy my cat a new collar since the last one broke. On the way there a voice very akin to the one that starts berrating me when my depression has been really bad ever since I was a child, started questioning me and doubting me and halfway berrating everything that I\'d felt and been happy and content about over the weekend and yesterday. Saying stuff like ""But you were born a boy, and you don\'t even really know if you\'re a girl at all."" and ""Women are weak, you wouldn\'t want to be weak and bullied like when you were a child again would you?"" and things like that. When we finally got to the shop I actually felt physically dimscomfortable with looking the way I did going into the shops, I wore a feminine cardigan and a t-shirt, black jeans and boots, something I legit wear everyday and absolutely feel fine in and love that type of outfit and have done so for the past 2 to nearly 3 years. I\'d never felt uncomfortable in that way before, being uncomfortable in my own body and scared people were looking at me even though I was wearing and looking like I have done for many years and feeling absolutely fine about it through all those years and loving the style and wardrobe I\'ve created for myself. It was legit one of the most horrible things I\'d ever experienced, I\'d experienced feeling uncomfortable and sad in my own skin but NEVER to this extent or this level and in this specific way before.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI went home and layed in bed and started to cry still having that voice berrate and question me inside my head and before falling asleep into a long nap the last thing I can really remember thinking conciously was ""I think I might be a girl...""   \nI\'ve never experienced anything on this scope and scale about my own gender identity before, I\'d gone my entire life feeling just fine with assigning myself as male and I\'ve never been unhappy with my genitalia and I\'m still not, but I don\'t really feel like just a feminine guy anymore but not entirely a girl either, at least not yet? And in hindsight I think this is something that\'s always been stirring in me since I was a child but that I\'d always repressed it as a survival mechanism having grown up in a broken home with a psychopatic and alcoholic father. I have so many questions and doubts and I just don\'t really know where I am or how I stand in terms of my own identity anymore. I hope this wall of text isn\'t too much for anyone to read in here and hopefully someone might be able to help me, I looked at all of your different picture posts in here and you\'re all so gorgeous and brave.

I'm here because I'm trans. And I've literally never spoken or written that down before today, even though I think it multiple times a day. I'm 35 years old, and this is the first time. 

I'm scared. I'm afraid of losing my family, my job, my safety -- I'm even afraid of losing my body. I hate it, but it's what I know. It's *all* I know.

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a boy. I have 2 sisters, and when we played pretend I always wanted to be the prince, or Tom Sawyer, or whoever the male character was in the world we were pretending to live in that day. I vividly remember getting in trouble when I was 6 because I took my shirt off like the boy next door had just done.

Puberty came late for me. I was 14 before I got to the point where I had to wear a bra. I hated it. Hated my hips, my breasts, my period -- at first, all I wanted was to go back to the way I was before. Then the dreams started -- and this is embarrassing af, but if I can't share it with total strangers I'll never meet, who *can* I share it with, right? Isn't that the whole purpose of the internet lol? 

Anyway. The dreams. They were sex dreams, but 'wrong.' I was the one on top. I could *feel* down there, and in my dreams I was hard. I can't explain it any better than that, and I'm turning bright red as I type this, but I was most definitely male. And they're recurring. I still get them sometimes. Idk if anyone else has had a similar experience, but I'd love to know if anyone has.

It's not just the dreams. It's everything. I want to be myself. I want to be the person I'm supposed to be -- and I'm terrified. I can't even tell my family I like other women. Telling them I'm trans would almost certainly mean instant expulsion from their midst, with a boot in the ass on the way out. I don't want to lose them, but at the same time, this is killing me. I wake up every morning and do my make up the way I was taught, but I can't meet my eyes in the mirror. I present as very feminine -- my hair is down past my waist (and objectively it's beautiful, but all I want is to cut it off and give it away), and as I said, I always do my make up and dress nicely. I was raised to behave like a lady, but it makes me feel sick inside until I get busy enough to forget what I'm wearing.

Idk if anyone else felt/feels this way. I don't want to say 'I hope so,' because this sucks. On the other hand, I don't want to be the only one. I want my experiences to be the door that opens onto who I'm supposed to be, instead of just a constant feeling of wearing the wrong skin. I can't put it any more clearly.

I'm sorry if I should have posted this elsewhere. I just couldn't find anywhere else it would fit. I just want someone to tell me that this is normal, that I'm not losing my mind. I can't tell anyone irl, so the internet is my next best choice lol. If this is in the wrong place, I apologize, and feel free to delete it.

513,2019-07-12 03:52:24,cc5sk6,1,5,"Ive been experiencing a lot of weird and new feelings recently, let me give some background to try and explain what‚Äôs been going on. 

I am a pansexual cis male. Back when I was younger experimenting with my sexuality and trying to discover myself, I had a lot of self hatred towards myself about the potential of having an interest in males. A lot of time went into working through things and finally accepting who I am. 

After being comfortable with who I was, I discovered I was sexually attracted to smaller, more feminine males. That rabbit hole led me down a path to discover cross dressing and playing around with that for a bit. 

I then got into a straight relationship and hung up my cross dressing clothing to focus on the relationship, assuming that it was all just a fetish for cross dressing and whatnot. 

I‚Äôve been in this relationship for more than 5 years now and can‚Äôt be happier. But recently, I‚Äôve been experiencing something strange. 

Sometimes I get the feelings like I want to be cute and more feminine. These feelings started to show up only when I was sexually aroused, due to the association with the things I was into previously. 

I‚Äôm a heavier guy than most, big beard, and long hair (about shoulder length). I‚Äôve recently been playing with more feminine hair styles and been taking a lot of photos and realizing that I look what I would describe as cute and more feminine than my regular self. 

Sometimes when I get these feelings, I get that same self hatred feelings I did when I was experimenting with my sexuality. Trying to convince myself there‚Äôs no way I can be any kinda of transgender. 

I genuinely don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm feeling and if I just feeling this way because of the things I‚Äôve been looking at recently. 

Has anyone felt anything similar? 

I know the only way I can get a definitive answer is by figuring out how I feel myself, but if anyone could guide my into the right direction, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

That rabbit hole led me down a path to discover cross dressing and playing around with that for a bit. \n\nI then got into a straight relationship and hung up my cross dressing clothing to focus on the relationship, assuming that it was all just a fetish for cross dressing and whatnot. \n\nI‚Äôve been in this relationship for more than 5 years now and can‚Äôt be happier. But recently, I‚Äôve been experiencing something strange. \n\nSometimes I get the feelings like I want to be cute and more feminine. These feelings started to show up only when I was sexually aroused, due to the association with the things I was into previously. \n\nI‚Äôm a heavier guy than most, big beard, and long hair (about shoulder length). I‚Äôve recently been playing with more feminine hair styles and been taking a lot of photos and realizing that I look what I would describe as cute and more feminine than my regular self. \n\nSometimes when I get these feelings, I get that same self hatred feelings I did when I was experimenting with my sexuality. Trying to convince myself there‚Äôs no way I can be any kinda of transgender. \n\nI genuinely don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm feeling and if I just feeling this way because of the things I‚Äôve been looking at recently. \n\nHas anyone felt anything similar? \n\nI know the only way I can get a definitive answer is by figuring out how I feel myself, but if anyone could guide my into the right direction, I‚Äôd appreciate it. \n\nThank you.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'What am I feeling?', 'created': 1562928744.0}"

565,2019-07-13 07:54:21,ccmt4v,2,9,"I guess it's time to write this.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to. It takes courage, courage that I know I have, to reveal myself to you. To openly welcome being othered, openly welcome the ridicule, harassment, and humiliation that will come from it, but I don't have any real options left, not if I'm going to continue living. I wanted to die. My plan was to poison myself with a lethal dose of caffeine, carbohydrates, and sugar. I opened a door back in 2014, after I had left my ex-wife. I didn't really want to leave her; the sex, while sporadic, was good, she was beautiful, funny, and wanted nothing more than to be with me. We had a successful business together, and had a lot of really good times. What we didn't have was good chemistry. She had been abandoned by her father, and never really got over it. I was fresh out of the Army and riddled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety that I learned to contain and shove deep down inside because her OCPD, OCD, and anxiety were too much for her to handle. But, this isn't about her.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm male (I have a penis and testicles), caucasian (my skin is white), and I'm primarily attracted to female and feminine presenting individuals. I grew up in a lower-middle class family, with a diverse amount of low- to upper-middle-class friends. I was the golden child of the family, the youngest on my father's side (except for my brother, who is seven years younger), and the oldest on my mother's. I tested well and was placed in gifted and talented programs in school. My IQ is somewhere in the 135-150 range. I've not had it specifically tested, but my ASVAB and vocational aptitude batteries put me in the top 1-3% of the population.

&amp;#x200B;

The first memories I have are of me around the age of two or three, maybe four, at the latest, grinding my penis against a stuffed animal because it felt good. I remember being scolded for doing that during naptime at church daycare. There's large portions of my childhood and adolescence that I don't remember, but what I do remember is being bullied and teased. I remember the only defense I had against my bullies in the fourth grade was to make fun of them for not being able to read as well as I could. That behavior continued until I was in my pre-teens, when I learned about how masturbation was bad, and that I was bad for masturbating and having 'lustful thoughts.' Often, my fantasies would involve becoming something else, some sort of transformation into an animal. I didn't find the act of sex arousing, but the idea of the physical transformation, was. I haven't ever wanted to be the ""me"" that everyone else sees.

&amp;#x200B;

We got America Online when I was about 12, in 1997. The internet wasn't ""new"" to me, then, though the connectivity to other people was. I remember logging onto the Prodigy network when I was younger using dial-up on a diskless 8088. The first ""pornographic"" website I visited was Victoria's Secret, and I fell in lustful jealousy for the first time. I fantasized about them, about the models with angel wings, about what it must be like to have breasts. I probably still have some 3 1/4"" floppies with some of those pictures saved, somewhere. During that time, I was also heavily into science fiction; it didn't matter what series. Star Trek, Star Wars, and Babylon 5 were the most accessible, but I was also reading Aasimov's ""Foundation"" series and a few others at the time.

&amp;#x200B;

AOL opened a whole new world; I met a girl at a Baptist convention that I had attended with my church's youth group, and we exchanged e-mail addresses. This was before instant messaging, and I remember getting home and trading long chains of e-mails back and forth with her. Later, I would get curious and start digging into the .pfc (""personal file cabinet"") files of my dad's e-mail. Before I reached that point, however, I discovered AOL's ""Rhy'Din"" chat rooms, which had a whole host of different-themed fantasy settings and topics, mainly geared towards fantasy role-play. I found and joined a Star Trek role-playing group that met once a week; my parents were less than thrilled to find out about that group. Taking the internet away from me became the only real punishment that they had.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a website, then, from the United Kingdom that was dedicated to stories and images about transformation to horses, donkeys, centaurs, and other equines. I had been role-playing in the Rhy'Din chat rooms (unbeknownst to my parents) as a centaur, at the time, and had already written one or two sex (horribly bad, I'm sure) sex scenes (not as a centaur). I was probably about 13 or 14 at the time. I remember in fairly vivid detail coming in from mowing the lawn, and seeing that website on the computer monitor with both of my parents staring at it. The talk my father and I had after was very short. He asked me why I was on it, and my response was ""It had what I was looking for (I was too embarassed to go into detail and say 'breasts').""

&amp;#x200B;

I was about that same age when I wrote my first BASIC program on a 486-DX33, a choose-your-own-adventure transformation-and-sex story using basic GOTOs and if/then input statements, that allowed me to write and play out my fantasies of becoming different superheroes (I was watching a lot of  'Superfriends' reruns at the time), and pseudo-animals (""furries,"" for those of you aware). I still have copies, somewhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I was also about 12 or 13 when I first discovered the ""Federation II"" Multi-User Dungeon beta, which was heavily advertised on AOL, and was billed as a text-based multiplayer adventure game for adults. Prior to that, most of my experience with text-based games had come from the InfoCom games (Moonmist, a Victorian-era murder-mystery had been my first). I had been using the name ""Paveway22"" on AOL up until this point (A moniker which was the combination of the 'Paveway III' bomb, featured heavily on the Sega Genesis game ""F-117 Nightstalker,"" and the .22 caliber bullet). It was revolutionary to me, in that it had the option to get a sex change (along with other options). I incorrectly assumed that it would also change the pronouns in the description I wrote, and started looking or textsex with strangers.

&amp;#x200B;

In school, I was still made fun of and laughed at for being 'the smart fat kid with glasses.' It didn't help matters when I joined band, and chose to play the flute. I lied and told people it was because it was easy to carry and fit in my backpack; the real reason was because it allowed me to be just a tiny bit more feminine, just a little bit closer to being with 'the other girls.'

&amp;#x200B;

By the time I got to High School, I hated myself and hated my body more. I had begged God to take away my sinful nature on more than one occasion, to make the desires and urges stop. Every time I masturbated, I felt guilt, shame, and remorse after (something that continues to this day). I had written sexually suggestive transformation stories about everyone I'd found attractive, and continued to do so. I had learned how to pick the lock to the computer. I spent hours browsing transformation and sex story repositories on the internet, behind my parents' back, and I spent my lunch hours in the library on different MUDs, some adult, some not, but the adult ones were where what I was looking for. I would trawl through AOL profiles, looking for people to instant message about centaur-themed role-play, and buried myself in books to escape from the people around me that either bullied me, made fun of me, or just ignored me. High School was better, because I was more invisible there.

&amp;#x200B;

I was 16 or 17 when I found Tapestries MUCK (The largest social variant of MUDs, heavy on furry and transformation themes). It was everything that I could want; I wrote sexually suggestive material with strangers, and developed a strong affinity towards BDSM. I was able to play female characters, to 'become' who I wanted, though at the time, I was still intensely guilt-ridden and ashamed to create those characters. On the non-adult MUDs, I was even able to find partners to write adult role-play with. I have been on and off of these different places for the last two decades of my life.

&amp;#x200B;

I found a home on Shangrila MUX the summer after I turned 18. No limits, no-holds-barred, play-anything-you-want. I wasn't alone. I was able to explore all the different fetishes and thoughts that had been accumulating in my head. I'm sure that I was fairly annoying at that time, but I found roleplay partners that enjoyed my company, enjoyed writing weird and odd kink. I created a female character to try and explore that side of myself, and ended up alone and ignored. I joined the Army and went to Basic Training the year after that, and I can't recall the names of the other roleplayers that I met. I remember the name of the domme that I'd met, first, though. Chris, short for Christine, and she sent me a christmas e-card.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been on and off of Shangrila MUX since then, several times. I have written so many sex scenes, so many fetish scenes, so many orgasm scenes that they come second nature to me. I've been writing sexual novelties for the last two decades. In 2014, I came out as transgender. My mom ""didn't believe me."" My family has been supportive, but I know they ""want their son"" back. I don't want to be like this. I don't want to be ""trans."" I don't want to have to explain myself to everyone I come across. I don't want to be ""male."" I'm not willing to be openly and visibly trans, to endure the same ridicule, humiliation and suffering that I did back in middle and high school just to ""be me,"" while having to rely on the comfort of internet strangers because I'm not a viable candidate for a female partner. I'm not willing to put myself at risk of being murdered because someone thinks I'm a monster, or a freak, or a threat to their masculinity or a threat to their children. I don't care what you think about trans people, or furries, or BDSM enthusiasts, or people with weird fetishes.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck You, God, You never even gave me a chance before You and Your fucked-up world fucked me. You took everything that's good, and beautiful, and pleasing, and You kept it for Yourself, and then let me be born into a world of shit You didn't want.

It takes courage, courage that I know I have, to reveal myself to you. To openly welcome being othered, openly welcome the ridicule, harassment, and humiliation that will come from it, but I don\'t have any real options left, not if I\'m going to continue living. I wanted to die. My plan was to poison myself with a lethal dose of caffeine, carbohydrates, and sugar. I opened a door back in 2014, after I had left my ex-wife. I didn\'t really want to leave her; the sex, while sporadic, was good, she was beautiful, funny, and wanted nothing more than to be with me. We had a successful business together, and had a lot of really good times. What we didn\'t have was good chemistry. She had been abandoned by her father, and never really got over it. I was fresh out of the Army and riddled with PTSD, depression, and anxiety that I learned to contain and shove deep down inside because her OCPD, OCD, and anxiety were too much for her to handle. But, this isn\'t about her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m male (I have a penis and testicles), caucasian (my skin is white), and I\'m primarily attracted to female and feminine presenting individuals. I grew up in a lower-middle class family, with a diverse amount of low- to upper-middle-class friends. I was the golden child of the family, the youngest on my father\'s side (except for my brother, who is seven years younger), and the oldest on my mother\'s. I tested well and was placed in gifted and talented programs in school. My IQ is somewhere in the 135-150 range. I\'ve not had it specifically tested, but my ASVAB and vocational aptitude batteries put me in the top 1-3% of the population.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe first memories I have are of me around the age of two or three, maybe four, at the latest, grinding my penis against a stuffed animal because it felt good. I remember being scolded for doing that during naptime at church daycare. There\'s large portions of my childhood and adolescence that I don\'t remember, but what I do remember is being bullied and teased. I remember the only defense I had against my bullies in the fourth grade was to make fun of them for not being able to read as well as I could. That behavior continued until I was in my pre-teens, when I learned about how masturbation was bad, and that I was bad for masturbating and having \'lustful thoughts.\' Often, my fantasies would involve becoming something else, some sort of transformation into an animal. I didn\'t find the act of sex arousing, but the idea of the physical transformation, was. I haven\'t ever wanted to be the ""me"" that everyone else sees.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe got America Online when I was about 12, in 1997. The internet wasn\'t ""new"" to me, then, though the connectivity to other people was. I remember logging onto the Prodigy network when I was younger using dial-up on a diskless 8088. The first ""pornographic"" website I visited was Victoria\'s Secret, and I fell in lustful jealousy for the first time. I fantasized about them, about the models with angel wings, about what it must be like to have breasts. I probably still have some 3 1/4"" floppies with some of those pictures saved, somewhere. During that time, I was also heavily into science fiction; it didn\'t matter what series. Star Trek, Star Wars, and Babylon 5 were the most accessible, but I was also reading Aasimov\'s ""Foundation"" series and a few others at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAOL opened a whole new world; I met a girl at a Baptist convention that I had attended with my church\'s youth group, and we exchanged e-mail addresses. This was before instant messaging, and I remember getting home and trading long chains of e-mails back and forth with her. Later, I would get curious and start digging into the .pfc (""personal file cabinet"") files of my dad\'s e-mail. Before I reached that point, however, I discovered AOL\'s ""Rhy\'Din"" chat rooms, which had a whole host of different-themed fantasy settings and topics, mainly geared towards fantasy role-play. I found and joined a Star Trek role-playing group that met once a week; my parents were less than thrilled to find out about that group. Taking the internet away from me became the only real punishment that they had.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI found a website, then, from the United Kingdom that was dedicated to stories and images about transformation to horses, donkeys, centaurs, and other equines. I had been role-playing in the Rhy\'Din chat rooms (unbeknownst to my parents) as a centaur, at the time, and had already written one or two sex (horribly bad, I\'m sure) sex scenes (not as a centaur). I was probably about 13 or 14 at the time. I remember in fairly vivid detail coming in from mowing the lawn, and seeing that website on the computer monitor with both of my parents staring at it. The talk my father and I had after was very short. He asked me why I was on it, and my response was ""It had what I was looking for (I was too embarassed to go into detail and say \'breasts\').""\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was about that same age when I wrote my first BASIC program on a 486-DX33, a choose-your-own-adventure transformation-and-sex story using basic GOTOs and if/then input statements, that allowed me to write and play out my fantasies of becoming different superheroes (I was watching a lot of  \'Superfriends\' reruns at the time), and pseudo-animals (""furries,"" for those of you aware). I still have copies, somewhere.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was also about 12 or 13 when I first discovered the ""Federation II"" Multi-User Dungeon beta, which was heavily advertised on AOL, and was billed as a text-based multiplayer adventure game for adults.

591,2019-07-13 21:04:21,ccuh09,3,2,"  Hello,

I‚Äôm going to sum this up as well as I can.  Soo I moved back in with my dad like 9 months ago after not being able to afford my place despite having a job I loved for once, they didn‚Äôt pay me all that well.

Living with my dad at 24 years old sucks he yells at me if there are any marks on the white appliances we have, if the bathroom door isn‚Äôt closed and if I open the windows to let light inside. When I go out he gets extremely upset. I do pay rent but anyways I work weekends and I know I need a change.

What should I do? I need my surgeries also and I just don‚Äôt see myself working low paying jobs anymore. For one, I will never be able to afford anything living and working low paying jobs in CA. And two I don‚Äôt like working for other people that expect the world from you but don‚Äôt even pay you a living wage. 
I‚Äôm a entrepreneur and want to start a business in the fashion industry. 

My plan is to get the fuck out of the situation I‚Äôm in and start doing what other ts girls do and escorting. I have done it before on and off. My plan is to pay for my surgeries, save and invest it so I can start my business and have it take off. 

My dad treats me like a failure and I was way more happy alone than with someone that you can tell doesn‚Äôt think highly of you. Please try to put yourself in my shoes and give me some feedback.

629,2019-07-14 15:10:39,cd4243,4,7,"Over the past 2 weeks I've told my girlfriend and my close friends to various extents that I have been questioning my gender identity and believe I am at least non-binary, maybe transfem. All the friends I've told have reacted positively, and my girlfriend was open to me exploring myself too which was such a relief. I went out with one of my best friends and she took me shopping to try on and buy some clothing a couple of times which felt amazing - we even went out exercising together in some quiet public places while I was dressed in my new feminine activewear. I got myself a top and a few skirts and it feels really good to just be open about how I feel and have people to talk to, but I want more. I wish I could be more open at home, but don't feel comfortable doing that at the moment, but it sucks that I can rarely ever wear my stuff for more than a few moments.  


I've lurked here and in similar communities for a while, and been questioning myself even since I was very young but only about 3 months ago finally went to talk to a psych about it. It has been good to be able to express rather than repress, and I have felt more balanced, but I feel like I've learnt so much more yet opened up so many more questions in the past week than I have for years. For a while I've been shaving my legs, and recently my body too except my arms, and I've purchased a fair few bras to wear under my clothing that have really felt affirming.  


Tonight I went out with 2 male friends dressed in the same activewear I mentioned before, and mostly it was fine, I even stopped thinking about what I was wearing sometimes, but at one point a group of teen boys all stopped talking and just stared at me as I walked out of the restaurant.   


I've decided I certainly want to learn to do more to pass, and also more subtle things to do to alleviate my dysphoria so I can feel more confident, yet not be obvious around my family.   


I want to learn to shave better, since it comes back so quickly and leaves a grey shadow on my face, and I think I want to shape my eyebrows differently too. My girlfriend suggested I get some tinted lip balm too. I've also been \*trying\* to speak with a higher, more varied tone but it's hard to keep conscious of it, I think my singing experience has been useful though in that regard.  


Part of me is still a bit torn. Like if anyone asked me at any time if I could choose to be a girl instead of a boy, I'd choose a girl every time, but I still feel torn, maybe just cos of fear?  It makes it hard to go to the gym, cos I want to be fit and strong for my masculine presentation - but I don't want to even feel like I need that in the first place, and it feels dysphoric to be more muscular, but while presenting as a guy, I still want to feel good about how I look, and I want to keep fit.  


I'd also like to share some of my photos of me, and ask for some advice for how I look and what I can do, but I feel afraid to share any photos publicly - I'm not sure how I can be sure to trust anyone. It'd be nice to have some trans people to talk to though.  


If anyone got this far, thanks for listening to my little vent, I'm hoping someone can share some of their experience or give me some advice. I probably havent got everything I'd like to say off my chest, but it has already felt good to write up this.

I go to see my therapist again next month so we can go over next steps and make sure everything's okay ect.

But I also know that a fertility sparing option will come up.

Idk I just don't think I can make the choice on whether or not I want kids in the future when I'm only 15. I kinda wanna get it so I have it but I also don't wanna get it because it's really invasive and embarrassing.

My question is, is dysphoria a prerequisite for being trans?

I generally consider that if I could choose my gender I'd have chosen female. But I don't hate my body, and I'm really hairy and I have broad shoulders. Not at all feminine. But I also kind of wish I was a woman as I live too, but I feel like its only in the same way you wish you had a certain type of hair or body shape. It doesn't affect me in any serious way.

I seem to feel more comfortable around women than men (I'm not ""one of the boys"") and I express in a more feminine way but really that's me moving away from toxic masculinity as much as possible tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Didn't experience much gender dysphoria as a young child, don't know if traumatic life events caused it, but it's been really hitting me a lot recently and I'm not sure if transitioning is the right solution.**

&amp;#x200B;

For most of my childhood, I don't remember suffering much dysphoria. I didn't feel an intense need to change my entire wardrobe or play with other toys. However, at around 9 or 10, I used to play this online game called Habbo Hotel where you would basically chat with other people online through avatars you could customize and play around with. I made a female avatar and that's when I first started pretending I was a girl, and for some reason it was a huge thrill. I convinced other people of it and I really liked interacting with them because they'd address me as a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

When puberty hit, it became a lot more intense. When I was 13 I became really infatuated with one of the girls at my school and I became weirdly obsessed with every detail about her. This is the first time I remember really wanting to be a girl, and for the next few years I always had a fantasy going on in my mind of switching bodies with her. That's also when I started investigating online about the process of transitioning, but I was immediately discouraged because of all the social and economic costs. Throughout this time I also continued pretending to be a girl online and liking it a lot, like I was expressing something I couldn't in real life.

&amp;#x200B;

At around 15, I got into a really terrible place in my life. I became very isolated, no friends or much contact with family, started to have very, very negative thoughts and jumped into the ""anti-SJW"" bandwagon that was rising in popularity. The suicidal thoughts I had from earlier in my life also increased in amount and intensity. Despite that, I found that a way to relieve my depression was to use messaging apps with random guys to send them pictures of my body so I could get a kick out of convincing them I was a girl.

&amp;#x200B;

Three or four years down the road, my life became increasingly worse. I continued down the ""anti-SJW"" rabbit hole to the point where I became a full on neo-nazi, a time during which I would heavily repress my past feelings by actively fighting trans rights. Seeing where my body was going, however, always made me very uncomfortable. I intensely disliked having hair all over and I hated the shape of my legs and bottom. On the other hand, I also felt good about my more feminine aspects, like my neck and hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 19 now, and after a long struggle I'm glad to have pulled myself out of the neo-nazi hole and I don't live life in constant dread anymore. But as a consequence, these feelings resurfaced and it's been worse than ever. I can't look at myself in the mirror, and if I do it's always a surreal experience, like I'm looking at someone else. I have to slap my face and claw at it until I'm in pain so I can snap out of it. I hate my body more than ever. The other day, I felt extremely uncomfortable talking and made the decision not to speak so I didn't have to hear the sound of my own voice. I don't feel like a man, and I feel really uncomfortable around them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to proceed from here. I'm scared that because of my age hormones wouldn't do anything, and I'm even more scared of the social consequences of transitioning.

I was at my therapists office and we were talking with my parents. I told her that i cannot live longer in my body and that i need hormones or else i would kill myself.

My parents agreed. I stood up and ran out of the room. Even though this was all a dream i was scared like I've never been.

I don't quite remember how it got to this point, seemed like a lot happened between that and the next thing I remember, but I became made up of circuit boards and wires. I'm basically screaming at my own body, wondering how it got replaced with electronics without me noticing. My mother was sarcastically being supportive about my new body saying things like ""You don't want to change anything on your body do you?"" ""What's wrong? Isn't this what you wanted?"" ""Why are you upset?"" All in this sweet condescending tone that would sound normal to anyone who doesn't know her. I look down again and just fucking cry. A lot. Then I start screaming to myself that I just want a normal body and I hate it and regret everything about it.

I get tics sometimes. Usually at night. I woke myself up with tics this morning whilst screaming in my dream. Nearly twitched my head right of the edge of the bed.

I've felt dysphoria from not being fem enough. I've felt it from not being masc enough. But that was the worst feeling of body dysphoria I've ever experienced (even though it was a dream).

It felt like a visceral scream from my soul trying to express itself but no scream was intense enough to reflect the feeling or organic enough to communicate the pain and my robotic screams of anguish only reminded me that I was trapped forever.

After waking up, I'm considering throwing everything fem away and trying to ignore the whole idea of being able to modify my body with drugs or surgery (HRT is daunting but surgery terrifies me). I'm worried that although I feel bad now, if I transition and it doesn't get me to look how I ideally want, I'm gonna feel that same feeling of being trapped in anguish but it won't stop until I kill myself.

Am I even transgender or do I just associate attractiveness with femininity? If that's the case if I never pass I'll never feel attractive.

&amp;#x200B;

I came out as transmasc to my husband and he was totally supportive and cool with that, asked about pronouns and all that, which I kind of got nervous about and panicked (I've been in this closet, like, the last 24 years, so it's going to take a little while to get all the way out there). 

&amp;#x200B;

It was not a \*complete\* surprise to him, as I had told him earlier this year and last that I'd been questioning some things n' stuff again, but I don't think he knew I'd continued being so conflicted and full of the angst that comes with the territory. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I have so much to explore now still and feel like I'm getting to know me again, but like the real, full me; like the other half I've ignored forever. It was really just nice to have that acceptance and I really like that it wasn't an Earth-shattering revelation for him, and has made me feel more secure in moving forward with my plans to start presenting more as male once I lose a few more pounds. Side note: I know I shouldn't use my gender as a weight loss goal but I had to get there somehow, lol. I know it's a fucked reward system but it's working XD 

&amp;#x200B;

So that was a thing, feeling a little bit more confident in all this now though and next I need outfits and a new name. And a really badly needed haircut.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, this was unexpected and super duper wonderful extreme!

I've only been seeing my therapist for about a month now. After my egg cracked wide open beginning of June, dysphoria has been regularly kicking my ass and taking my lunch money. This was apparent to my therapist I guess, though our sessions are only 45 min and I never feel its enough time to talk, she saw it. 

Last week during our session, she gave me the number to her endocrinologist she likes so I could get a consultation on HRT (which happened 7/16/2019). She said that she gave me that number far quicker than anyone she has worked with in her 20+ years as she could tell I was in real distress and felt I needed it was time already. I'm not bragging that it was fast just shocked is all. I had been horrible depressed, I mean we all know how dysphoria gets but I didn't realize how bad it actually was getting. 

I spent 3 days after I got the endo docs number just completely a mess. I called out for work, slept a lot, played games to get my mind off it, smoked A LOT OF WEED to try and forget who I was. Obviously none of that helped. So I finally broke down after and made the call, which took some serious mental efforts to keep from losing it. Seriously, I felt so much better the rest of the week/weekend and I didn't even really notice it until I had my next therapy session. I guess just the thought knowing that I was going to begin to do something about this was enough to curve that pain a bit. My therapist noticed I was much happier when she saw me this week, so clearly that's a good sign I think.

 Well, I had my doc appointment yesterday and I start my shots next Tuesday!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I'M SO EXCITED!!!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

I decided to go with injections as I wanted a delivery system that was more efficient and I like that you only have to do it every two weeks. Plus, I'm horribly lazy with certain things and I don't want to have to remember to take a pill every day. I plan on doing the pellets (a time release system they put under your skin I guess) because they last for 3 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fam, I'm so excited I don't even know what to do!! I really need to come out to my BFF so I can talk about it, but I still don't know how he will take the news.. suppose I should try to make some trans friends but I'm destructively introverted and its difficult for me to make and maintain friends as it is.  I do think part of it is how emotionless I usually am so people tend to think I don't like them or something.. anyway I'm rambling now..

&amp;#x200B;

Did I mention that I'M FREAKING OUT BECAUSE I'M SO EXCITED!

Since I learned what hrt was, I knew that one day I wanted to go on testosterone. Getting a needle would be a small price to pay for a deeper voice, fat redistribution, maybe getting a tiny bit taller (but probably not, at 17 im mostly done growing), and I was even excited for getting more body hair even though it would make me look even more like a gorilla than I already do. 

In the past four or five years, my health has been getting worse. At first, it was developing depression and anxiety.

I told him that not using my prefered name or pronouns means, by definition, that he's transphobic. He insists that it doesn't.

850,2019-07-18 23:04:06,cezoqd,0,1,"Okay here goes. My generation is lucky. We wete the first to have internet and cable. I took that to full advantage growing up. I had aol, back in the day. One day i joined a chatroom. I began chatting and i got an IM from this girl. We chatted and became friends. So i added her. We began chatting about everyday. Shed tell me how hard it eas going to school, though i had the same feelings, being a tramsplant a relatively new still. One day, she wad depressed and talked of suicide. I was shocked. I eanted to help. So i asked her what wad bothering her. Now, notice she had sent me pictures prior, and she was so gorgeous! Well...she told me, a bomb at the moment, ""Im Trans"". I didnt know what she was talking about. She said search the terms. So I did. Then i said"" hey it doesnt matter anyway"" then we began our deep conversation on life.
   This opened up a whole new world for me. Ive never even kissed a girl before. Yet, here i am literally falling for this girl. We became good friends. Real close. She also pointed out other girls who were trans. I added them
 I also found a few. I wad only like 13 or 14. My interest grew. I knew then at 13, ""I wanted to marry a trans woman"". My friends list grew to obscure people around the world. My friend from NYC, goth , pot head, who always had a tif with his mother. Also a few older ladies, who to them my smitten attempts where cute, and i had to grow up. 
  Time passed by, i would stay in contact with them all. We'd talk all day throught the summer. When school rolled around wed keep eacher on the up n up, be thete for each othet. Buy, as late teens hit, they became distant a bit. My friends wrte now dating guys, and had problems dating. I didnt undetstand. I was absolutley smitten. Shoot, id date you, but distance wouldnt allow it. 
    I went to school at a place ehere we didnt have any trans women. We only had a few gay guys. I knew then i wasnt interested. Yet i had relationships with ladies, it just wasn't working. Id fond myself wishing she was trans although id never even been or even met a trans woman before. My friends on the other hand, in school, always played the "" if you had a million dollars would you"" game. One day the "" kiss a trans"" question hit. I said "" hell yea!"" Welp, then the rumors started. Even though it didnt bother me, n had validity. 
   I graduated school and left for my next adventure. After my initial engagement, while walking in amall i saw this tall beautiful lady. Mind you im still a little green. I noticed her! ""OMG. Thats the lady from that TV show!"" Indeed it wad here. Most of what i knew was my friends online, what i sawon TV i.e.  Springer or MTV. Yet it was her. I had a friend with me. I walked to her n said hi. She looked and smiled. Wr chatted. My friend was totally confused. "" DUDE shes a..."" She invited me to her place. I accepted. I was only 18. Her being my senior she knew what she was doing. We got to her pad, in which she had a friend with her. My friend pushed up on hers, as she and i talked passionately. OMG she invited me back. Uh oh! My friend was in dismay shaking his head. I went back. She undressed to her beautiful undergarments. Then kissed me. OMG! It happened. Yup! 
Well the word got around what happened. I wasridiculed for years. Even attacked a few times. I tried to keepin contact with her. She told me she was a working girl n i had to accept that. I had to learn the hard way. Things got so bad. I hadto cut it off. I couldnt love her the way she wanted n needed. I was also getting the worst. Yea, chicken shit. 
 Once i got used to it, while out in town i met a lady. She was strikingly beauriful. Mind you, i couldnt keep an ongoing relationship. Once the ""he ____ a trans"" came up i was single. Story of my life. But there was this lady. We talked. She told me all about her...in which i absolutely loved because i was into t, and didnt see it coming. Wr became friends. Lovers, of sort. Every weekend we spent together. Man i was in love. One say i asked her to marry me. It wasnt until i was 19 when i figured out i couldnt date a trans woman. I eas crushed. She cried all night. From my job, it wadnt too kind to the trans relationship thing. After so much attacks there and home. I packed my bags. She and friends begged me not to. Stating how umhappy i would be. 

 Returning home i hopped back on aol. A little experience now. I thought id learned up a bit. To my shock. My friemds were sex workers and in porn. They changed so much. One telling me we could hang out for money. Another bless her soul, was tired of the way guys treated her. She was from Jersey. I remember her screen name still lol. She was so cool. She would go on and on all day. Wed make plans but i had school and work. I wanted to be the guy to get her out of it. I temembered the innocent girl from our early teens. Here she is working now. Though she genuinely still was the same to me. Shed tell me things that just broke my heart. 
  After a bit of traveling and failed relationships, i had my fun. But coming from my family, it was so hard to tell them of my attraction. I ended up in a long relationship with a cis woman. It nearly destroyed me. So toxic. She knew of my attraction. She rubbed it in my face. Shed watch the xxx videos and say how how it was. Yet there i am conflicted. Finally it ended. 
 Now with it being ovet. Being older now, not too old though lol! I look back and regret yhe chances i didnt take. The ladys here are not into me. I dont make the most money. I sit missing my old AOL friends. Like im a good guy. 

Theres thos thing wete they say chaser. Well what about the guy who was interested wjem he first started being interested in anything? If you can begin to like guys, why cant guys begin to like you then, also? I think about my friends a lot. Especislly my one from NJ. She changed her name a few times. I knew she was in the field. I just wasnt her type anymore. Also, my others have changed so much, maybe i need to. Yet i remember then, when we were young and i was truly on your side. 

It sucks being into trans. I get stereotyped too much. Some guys really mess it up for us. I know theres someone for me...but theres no where to find you. Im not going to a club. Not my thing. I want the lady thats not always in the club i guess. Around here most of the ladies are on the scene or are in some tight knit community. So good luck for us normies.

What do i do? Ive attempted suicide more than a few times over this matter. I also have had crushing depression. I know i need to move.

And so i posted here. I just really need a little hope i guess. Sometimes i feel that the guys who truly like and would be serious with trans women have it the worst. Even the ladys treat us bad. It sucks! I didnt think it be like this way back then. I actually couldnt wait until i was on my own, finally able to find her. Maybe she has to find me. Well...i dont know...

AFAB. I do not believe that I am transgender, as I do not connect fully to the idea of being male. However, I grew up with a lack of connection to my assigned gender, and I feel like the disassociation has grown over time. I went from not feeling connected to being a girl to wishing my voice was deeper, or my chest was more flat. Socially, I tolerate being called ""she"" but male pronouns make me comfortable.

I understand though, that this does not mean that I am a guy. Maybe I am a man in denial, but for now, this is a very hard thing for me to accept. I'm not sure what to do. Should I try to be a woman, or see what living as a man for a while is like? 

From what I understand, a lot of trans people just seem to *know* that they are the opposite gender from the start. It's not something you ""test out"". I only thought/saw myself as male for a few short periods throughout my life, and although I enjoy/enjoyed it, committing fully to male is not a decision that I could see myself making right now. If it's possible, I want to work out these feelings as much as I can before coming to any type of conclusion.

TL;DR: I don't feel female, and feel comfortable when presenting as male. Does that mean that I *am* a guy, or that I just like socially presenting as one? I know that your gender identity is a very personal thing, and that the only one that really knows what you are for certain is you, but some clarification on this would be *deeply* appreciated.

I can't tell anyone so I hope it's okay that I share it here. I don't exactly know what I'm looking for, but I've been up all night thinking again and I just feel like I need to shout this out there somewhere. 

I hate my language, czech, everything is so overly gendered, every verb, everything, you put your gender there and it makes me very aware of how uncomfortable I feel having to use the female gendered brand of everything. Literally everything feels like it has a specific gender to me and I can't stop thinking that way. I hate talking to people in Czech and for the longest time I thought it was just the way the language was that made me feel weird, but it's how gendered everything is. I just can't call myself a female and be comfortable with it and feel like I'm being honest with people.

I like goth fashion and I thought I didn't like wearing dresses n stuff cause it wasn't goth enough and I watched a video recently of a goth guy dressing in the most goth shit I've ever seen and my mind was screaming ""yes I wish I looked like that"". But I don't... I'm the most female person on Earth, there's no denying the way I was born, so why do I not appreciate the curves, my chest and all of that? I should be happy! Most girls could only dream of my measurements...

I should mention I'm very adept at denial. I've been diagnosed with bpd, depression and generalized anxiety disorder, but most of the time I'm like ""depression what? Lmao no way, I'm happy af"" and I believe it. That's why I find it so hard to nail down my gender. 

I came out to my mom as bi with a PowerPoint presentation that included gender and sexuality. And.. well, at that time I secretly ordered a binder and it felt so nice not having my giant chest just be there, but after I showed my mom the presentation I made, she made fun of trans people and I very promptly shoved the binder I spend all my money on under my bed and wore dresses and skirts and all that, it didn't feel right but I thought it just wasn't goth enough.

Now I have the best girl goth clothes I could ever want, but it's still not quite there. And that goth guy, he.. he wore exactly everything I ever wanted to wear and it made me think about this for days and nights straight. I want to look like him, I want people to look at me and call me a he, a handsome guy, a boy, their boyfriend, their guy friend, but I can't accept those feelings.

I don't have any friends, pride starts in Czech republic next month and I'd feel like a fraud going dressed there as a female or as a male, so I'm thinking of not going but I think I need to...

&amp;#x200B;

i am a straight male (biologically). for the past two years i've wondered if i am trans.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a fetish of genderswapping / gender change. when i masturbate, i like to imagine i have a pussy and pretend to masturbate like i have one (even though it doesn't do anything, the thought turns me on). outside from when i am aroused or in the mood, I generally don't think at all of being a woman, but just about every time when I am aroused I either imagine being in the womans position or being a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

i've been lurking on this sub for quite some time, reading peoples ""how i learned/knew i was trans"" posts, but none of them really sound similar to what i've felt. the closest i've stumbled across is someone mentioning that in games he played he always chose to play female characters, which is something i too have done for as long as i remember, but i'm not really going to realize my gender identity based on an unimportant option in videogames lol

&amp;#x200B;

Right wingers and religious groups always say that little kids can't possibly know who they are or what they want to be at that age. My republican/Catholic mother has even called it child abuse to let children live as their non-biological gender. Hard eye roll.

I personally think that gender isn't something that is decided, it is something that already exists within us... Therefore allowing children to live as the gender they innately feel they are doesn't really require them to know what they want. They are just being themselves. 

However, I'm curious if there has been anyone who did regret living a non-cis life and wanted to go back.

I may be fine with just an orchi but I doubt it so I want to keep it as an option.

Dear Mum or Dad,

I wanted to do this in person but I felt it would be easier for both of us for me to leave you a note instead. The so called 'Issue' we've been putting off for so many months isn't something I want to hide anymore. I can't. It hurts me to hide who I really am.

I understand that you don't understand Gender Dysphoria (Transgender) and I know it's hard for you to come to terms with it but believe me. It's 10x harder for me. This isn't something that can go away. It can't be hidden without negatively affecting my mental health. It makes me feel depressed and that's not something I should have to live with.

Being like this isn't a choice. It's not something I want to be, it never is with Gender Dysphoria. It'll never go away, it's part of me just as much as my favourite colour or my love of cats. I can claim they've gone away when really there still there. Gender Dysphoria is caused by a hormone imbalance in the early stages of life. No one makes it happen, it just sorta happens to some people. No one's at fault.

Nothing has changed about me except I'm more open about it. I want to build trust between us and open doors for me to be able to talk to you. This is the great secret I've hidden since I was a toddler. I always knew I was different, I just never knew I had the guts to do anything about it.

All I ask from you is to accept me and work with me. I want nothing to change between us. All I want is to live the life I want to live. I only have 1 life, I don't wanna live that life depressed and full of self hate. And that's why I need to 'Transition'.

I know what your thinking: ""It'll be harder for you to get a job!"" ""We would have to move!"" ""It's difficult to Transition!"". They are legitimate concerns, however none of them actually apply. 1: How would I get a job? Companies can't discriminate against employees for being trans, the backlash is too big from the media and the lawsuit wouldn't be worth it. The world's a different place. Also companies strive for diversity nowadays so are more prone to hiring trans people than ever! 2: We would have to move! Really? Would we? People care a lot less about others lives than you think. I know at least 3 trans people in kingsteignton and not one has been run out of town. There been no protests, no riots. The world's a different place. Also theres legal protection to stop that happening under harassment laws. It just doesn't really happen anymore. 3: it's difficult to Transition! No it isn't. HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) could mean that I'm unrecognisable in 6 months to 2 years. Seriously look up Transwomen HRT. There's a reason it's been called magic. Now I know NHS waiting lists to get HRT is 3 years however there is a private system I can use that would cost ¬£200 for an appointment and as long as my GP agrees to work with them I can get the Hormones on the NHS and Blood tests whenever needed.

I hope this helps, and I hope it will allow you to understand what I'm going through.

Please for my sake think about this with a fresh mindset and try to put yourself in my shoes, however hard that may be. I'm only trying to do what's best for me.

All I want is to live the life I want to live. I only have 1 life, I don\'t wanna live that life depressed and full of self hate. And that\'s why I need to \'Transition\'.\n\nI know what your thinking: ""It\'ll be harder for you to get a job!"" ""We would have to move!"" ""It\'s difficult to Transition!"". They are legitimate concerns, however none of them actually apply. 1: How would I get a job? Companies can\'t discriminate against employees for being trans, the backlash is too big from the media and the lawsuit wouldn\'t be worth it. The world\'s a different place. Also companies strive for diversity nowadays so are more prone to hiring trans people than ever! 2: We would have to move! Really? Would we? People care a lot less about others lives than you think. I know at least 3 trans people in kingsteignton and not one has been run out of town. There been no protests, no riots. The world\'s a different place. Also theres legal protection to stop that happening under harassment laws. It just doesn\'t really happen anymore. 3: it\'s difficult to Transition! No it isn\'t. HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy) could mean that I\'m unrecognisable in 6 months to 2 years. Seriously look up Transwomen HRT. There\'s a reason it\'s been called magic. Now I know NHS waiting lists to get HRT is 3 years however there is a private system I can use that would cost ¬£200 for an appointment and as long as my GP agrees to work with them I can get the Hormones on the NHS and Blood tests whenever needed.\n\nI hope this helps, and I hope it will allow you to understand what I\'m going through.\n\nPlease for my sake think about this with a fresh mindset and try to put yourself in my shoes, however hard that may be. I\'m only trying to do what\'s best for me.\n\nP.S: please talk to me first before talking to the other parent whoever finds this first, I\'d prefer to talk 1 to 1 before going anyfurther!', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My coming out letter', 'created': 1563682277.0}"
961,2019-07-20 22:00:08,cfrh7s,0,3,"Hey folks! I‚Äôm Avery (they/them) and I‚Äôm looking for more people to come share some of their experiences or beliefs surrounding faith and gender on my podcast. I‚Äôm looking especially for interviewees who are POC and/or transfeminine. 

Blessed Are the Binary Breakers is a podcast that interviews trans and/or nonbinary persons about their experiences with faith and gender. 
The goal of this podcast is to gather the stories of as many transgender and/or nonbinary people as possible, from as many faiths and countries and perspectives and backgrounds as possible. (Find out where to listen to / read previous eps here: transchristianity.com/podcast)

I am thrilled about how many different voices have been shared with me so far ‚Äì we‚Äôve gotten to hear from people from the United States, from Poland, and from Indonesia; people in their teens and twenties and people in their forties and fifties; folks who are Christian, Jewish, atheist, Muslim, and more. 
But so far, I have failed at reaching more people of color, and more trans women or nonbinary people assigned male at birth. We‚Äôve gotten to hear from a few such people so far, but this podcast is currently overwhelmingly white and features many more people assigned female at birth than amab people. 

This is a problem particularly when you look at the fact that transgender people of color, and transfeminine people, and especially Black trans women face even greater levels of violence and have even less access to resources than the rest of us. 

Too often, those of us who are white have more access to life-saving resources than our transgender siblings of color. Spaces that are meant to be friendly and helpful to all trans people end up being racist and misogynistic and hurting trans people of color and trans women who try to get help from them. Those of us who are white have our voices amplified more frequently than theirs. And while we face violence too, they face so much more because of their intersecting identities. 

So I want to extend an invitation specifically to transgender and nonbinary people who belong to one or both of the following categories:

- If you‚Äôre a trans woman, or transfeminine, or otherwise assigned male at birth; and/or
- If you‚Äôre a person of color. 

And just to make it clear, if you‚Äôre interested in being on the show, you would be welcome to talk about anything you want to talk about. Anything that you‚Äôd prefer not to have to talk about, you don‚Äôt have to! You can make it as serious or laid-back as you want; I always want to leave it to the interviewee to set the mood. So if you want to come on and talk about racism and transmisogyny, you‚Äôre totally welcome to ‚Äì but if you‚Äôd rather not talk about that stuff at all, there‚Äôs no pressure from me to. You can talk about your personal journey as a whole or just a couple anecdotes from it, or share your favorite things about your faith tradition, what you think about um the divine, what you think about gender, whatever else you want to talk about!
You all deserve to share your stories; and the rest of us need to listen to your voices, your stories, your wisdom. It is my privilege to host this podcast that allows me to amplify voices; I want to do better at using this special opportunity to amplify the voices at the margins of the margins. 

So yeah, if you are transfeminine and/or a person of color, please reach out to me at queerlychristian36@gmail.com if you would be interested in appearing on this show! Thank you!!

But ever since I was at least like 17 or so I find myself constantly fantasizing about being a woman and having a woman's body. I've had a deep desire to know what it's like to be feminine in both a personal, social, and sexual situations. 

I'd want female friends that I did girl stuff with. Talk to girls where the dynamic of me being a ""straight boy"" didn't exist. 

I'd want to be desired by men. Be pretty and cute. Get hit on. Have guys fight over me. Be shorter and weaker than my boyfriend. Get lifted up off my feet. Get physically dominated in bed. Become pregnant, and keeping life in my body for 9 months.  

I'd even want to be all by myself female. It would be fun to have that kind of a body. 

If there was a button that would turn me female forever, I would push that button. 

&amp;#x200B;

But on the other hand, I also really like being a dude. I like flexing in the mirror. I like climbing trees and wrestling dogs, humans, etc. Being able to run faster and smash things better than most of the people I know is fun. Obviously women can do all of that stuff too, but I enjoy doing that *as a man.* I enjoy the masculine imagery and identity of it. 

And sexually, being stronger and more aggressive than my female partners is also fun. I feel no dysphoria in being dominant towards women. 

&amp;#x200B;

The times I feel dysphoria are the rare occasions when I'm trying to be sexual with a dude (which I would prefer to do as a female), and my masculine characteristics become all too apparent. 

&amp;#x200B;

If it was a simple decision, I would give up all the joys of being a man so that I could be a woman. But I won't, because it's not a simple decision. And there is no magic button. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really trying to give you my life story. I just want to know if there's a name for what I am. 

I rarely really *do* anything trans. A lot of people just think I'm a red blooded cishet man. But I watch videos and fantasize in my own head a lot.

She was my roommate in college (not out at the time, otherwise she wouldn't have been allowed to share a dorm room), and while she's known she's trans for years and years, she only came out to me about a year ago.  She's out publicly now, going through hormone therapy, and getting closer all the time to feel like she's passing.

Anyway, I often get private messages from her detailing her latest reactions that she has had to various anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications, as well as struggles with applying for jobs, dealing with transphobic family members, lack of a support network, and even suicide attempts.  I'm having two issues:

1. I live two thousand miles away from her--I moved back to the Midwest after college, from the west coast, and she's still out there.  All I can really do is offer my support--and, when she asks for it, advice.
2. I'm a cis dude.  While I would 100% consider myself an ally and in full support of the trans community, I can't begin to say that I've experienced anything on the level that she's gone through.  I try to sympathize and empathize, but that obviously can only go so far.

I want to be as much help as I can, but I'm running out of ways to respond to her messages in a supportive fashion.  I want her to know that I'm always there to lend support, help, and an ear, but my biggest fear is that my responses are going to become rote or start to come off as blase--just because I don't know what else to say.  I'm not particularly great at coming off as genuine, even when I'm trying to be.  I suppose I'm mainly wondering with folks who are trans--when you've been in your darker places, what have you wanted to hear?

She's out publicly now, going through hormone therapy, and getting closer all the time to feel like she's passing.\n\nAnyway, I often get private messages from her detailing her latest reactions that she has had to various anti-anxiety and anti-depressant medications, as well as struggles with applying for jobs, dealing with transphobic family members, lack of a support network, and even suicide attempts. I'm having two issues:\n\n1. I live two thousand miles away from her--I moved back to the Midwest after college, from the west coast, and she's still out there. All I can really do is offer my support--and, when she asks for it, advice.\n2. I'm a cis dude. While I would 100% consider myself an ally and in full support of the trans community, I can't begin to say that I've experienced anything on the level that she's gone through. I try to sympathize and empathize, but that obviously can only go so far.\n\nI want to be as much help as I can, but I'm running out of ways to respond to her messages in a supportive fashion. I want her to know that I'm always there to lend support, help, and an ear, but my biggest fear is that my responses are going to become rote or start to come off as blase--just because I don't know what else to say. I'm not particularly great at coming off as genuine, even when I'm trying to be. I suppose I'm mainly wondering with folks who are trans--when you've been in your darker places, what have you wanted to hear?

&amp;#x200B;

So... I need some feedback and advice.  I woke up this morning after having a week-long very dark feeling overtake me.  It's a pattern that I've repeated many many years....  it goes like this:

&amp;#x200B;

I get word that I have some free/alone time coming up in the place that I live, I go buy some more feminine clothes, some makeup, body shapers, etc... I get the alone time and dress up trying on all the clothes, posing, just hanging out in relaxing clothes, try different make-up styles.  I get somewhat satisfied at being able to look more feminine, but then I get disgusted by how far from feminine I am, go dark in my whole being and then purge all my clothes at some point when housemates/partners/friends come back and I don't have that alone time.  I go back to being the masculine self everyone knows.

&amp;#x200B;

This cycle has happened at least a dozen times in my life... from being first on my own at 18, to being at college in my early 20's, then those rare weekends I got the house to myself when my wife was out of town for a workshop.  She is too small to borrow clothes from, so I would have to sneak stuff here and there and pass it off as burning man gear.  Now, we're separated and living in separate towns, and I am subletting a room in SF.  

&amp;#x200B;

But, now, my only housemate is out of the country for a few weeks and I have gone further than I ever have before with a gaffe, body shaping corset, hip enhancers... and I have a C-cup breast plate showing up in a week :o  ... I just went out yesterday with only a little eye makeup on and felt terrified.  I'm about to go out in male clothes but with all my body shaping gear underneath.  

&amp;#x200B;

I woke up this morning reading all of the MtF and transition stories here on Reddit and am now terrified I actually might be trans (as opposed to just convincing myself I'm gender queer or just drawn to occasionally presenting more feminine to trusted female friends).  Reading the stories and feeling how right it feels to be more feminine I got one tiny glimpse of joy in my heart about being free... crazy, but wearing a tight gaffe and stretch jeans with dainty sandals makes me feel so alive.  And, I'm kinda both disgusted with myself and fighting with myself inside to just go all out and be as free and feminine as I want where I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't imagine ever telling my family, my work, by (ex/separated) wife... my kids!  I read this morning, too, that some California planned parenthood can help with prescribing HRT and I will be setting up an appointment this week.  But, to me, it feels like a dead-end... I almost want to go on HRT and hide the changes from everyone but a couple of close female friends... go as far as I can on the hormones and then when it's too far to turn back, I would just disappear.  I want to live out my fantasy as a woman but not actually go all the way, killing both her and him :(

&amp;#x200B;

Oh... and to add to this, I have been happily hetero for so long (a couple of my female friends have referred to me as a lesbian stuck/caught in a man's body).  But... I had a full on penetrative encounter with a guy last weekend and had two full-on full-body feminine orgasms that just make me want more of that... to give into a man's desire and be as pretty and submissive as I can.  But, then I imagine how masculine I must look in my soft clothes and bad make-up and just want to kill myself again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Help!  Has anyone ever been in this space?  What did you do to get out?  Where did you turn?

So this is something of a long story, but I'll try to keep it brief. My oldest friend came out as trans to me yesterday. We've known each other 13 plus years, and for those 13-ish years she's the closest thing to a brother I've ever had (Common thing I told her.)   


She dropped this on me in an incredibly casual manner, some joke about lesbians being the only friends I have was made and she laughed and said ""Yeah and now I am too."" Turned out she was being casual about it and genuinely thought she had already come out to me, which caused a small amount of confusion.   


""Wait, what?""   


""Oh, uh, yeah, am girl.""   


""Seriously?""   


""Yup. Am girl.""   


""Huh. Cool.""  


We sat and talked for ages, she's yet to come out to her folks or really anyone aside from her sister and her friendgroup. She's still working up the courage to do so. She still acts exactly the same (Gets super excited over board games/RPGs, makes puns, etc), wears the same clothes, hasn't yet even considered a name change, etc. etc. And she's sworn me to general secrecy, so when my dad was sitting and gaming with us, I was still referring to her as a boy. Also typing her pronouns is so much easier than saying them, and that makes me feel like shit.  


So I guess by now you're all wondering why I made this post. Basically, to sum up, I've never been close friends with someone who was trans, and I love my friend with all my heart. She's a bit weird, no doubt, but we grew up together. What are good ways to support someone, especially someone who isn't entirely out of the closet yet?

I don't know how this came about, though. I believe it was  through our  church, maybe. Everything, including most of my memories, are blurry(it was a very, very, in many ways, abusive home, and I've been estranged from them for years), but I only remember that I really liked him, and wanted him to stay. We got along great. He had a very soft-spoken voice, I remember.
Dammit, I really wanted to be friends with him. 

Suddenly, after about a week or two, my parents kicked him out, saying he was a liar, that he was really a girl. I had no say in this, of course. He was a ""pervert who saw my mother in her underwear"". Well, you dumbfucks, maybe you shouldn't parade around in your undies around our new guests, you fucking moron perverts, let alone underage ones.

Let me start from the beginning. This happened while on a recent trip to Thailand, during my last week in the country. I was having a blast, taking in all the sights and sounds around me. I'd go out every day, and stay out all night, getting lost and immersed in the culture. I think I took it a little too far this time. I was messaging a girl on Tinder. She wasn't drop-dead gorgeous, but seemed interested in hooking up. Fine, I thought. I could use some casual, no-strings-attached sex. I was doing some sightseeing up North at the time, but didn't mind making the hour-long drive to her apartment.

Immediately after arriving there, and meeting this random Tinder girl in person, I could tell that something was wrong. First, she used a different name than the one on her profile. The name that she wanted me to call her was entirely too European for an Asian girl, and felt contrived. I honestly couldn't tell if she was trying to convince me, or herself, that it was really her name, but I let it slide.

Second, she spoke in an completely unnatural way. Her voice was high-pitched, but didn't sound feminine. It sounded cartoonish. But again I let it slide. Besides, my phone was dead, and I was in an unfamiliar area. I needed to use her charger if I ever wanted to get back to my place. I sat beside her on the bed, one thing lead to another, and soon we started making out.

Her skin was soft. Like a woman's. I've never met a man with skin that soft, so I started to wonder if maybe it was all in my head. I wanted to run, but I didn't want to run if she was really a woman. I took off her shirt, and started sucking on her breasts. I could feel the implants. I pulled back, and saw little hairs growing from around her nipples. I was absolutely repulsed, but was unable to say or do anything before she started going down on me. I was semi-erect, and she told me to finish.

I didn't know what the fuck to do. I felt like running away, but I was tired and confused, and erect, and didn't know how to make a clean getaway. So I grabbed a bottle of lube that was sitting on the nightstand, closed my eyes, and finished. I then got the fuck out as fast as I could.

Looking back on it, I feel deceived. Not once did I ever get those warm, happy, tingly feelings that I get when hooking up with a biological female. Not in the beginning. Not during the climax. I should also mention that I'm normally a pretty accepting person, but this experience certainly caught me off guard. If I'm being honest, I feel like I hooked up with an Asian boy.

I wrote this because I feel my stances are not comprehensive enough and want to change that. I have nothing but good intentions. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I (think) understand:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Gender and sex are different; sex refers to the biological sex organs you possess, while gender is how this is expressed to the public.

\-Sex is not a binary, but a binomial distribution of sexual organs, in which people can fall in between male and female a number of ways. These also differ in how much hormonal influence they have.

\-Gender is how you identify yourself in relation to your sex, cis meaning you identify as/with your sex and trans meaning you don't. (I dont fully grasp nonbinary which I ask about below)

&amp;#x200B;

General questions I have:

&amp;#x200B;

\-Is being trans referring to how a personal view of certain sex assignments, particularly what they mean for personal expression, dont apply to your own identity? I think this devolves into a nature v nurture argument, since society can shape what people view as masculine or feminine.

\-What is gender expression? Is this just referring to how you express typical or atypical male/female mannerisms that reflect your gender identity?

\-Does non-conforming mean that your personal relationship between your sex and gender doesnt have a part in your self identity? I.e. you wouldnt say ""Im a man from \[a place\]"" when describing yourself, rather you wouldnt refer to your gender in general.

\-What is a nonbinary/non-conforming gender? Is this just a way to refer to someone's unique personality that possibly blends male or female expressions?

\-I just read that gender dysphoria refers to the anxiety and distress a transgender person would feel due to their gender identity not aligning with their sex, not the misalignment itself. Is that correct?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Being transgender or nonbinary seems to me to be nearly synonymous with personal identity or personality. These things are how you feel on the inside and how that relates to your expression with the world. I believe that people are able to express themselves any way they want and that being labeled male or female shouldn't really determine how you do so. However I can understand how being labeled in that way can put pressures on one to express in typical fashions. Is this a core issue with trans people? I also wonder about how these expressions seem to depend on cultural norms. Men and women in a different time or place may have different cultural expectations than today.

I plan on slowly transitioning and then coming out to my school and friends via a name change on the register.\n\nSo boom! That\'s the plan, but\n\nhow do I come out to unsupportive friends?? My unsupportive mom? What about my dad (I rarely ever get to talk to him)??\n\nI\'m confident in my plan to transition, but now summer hit, I\'m getting my hair cut and getting a binder. I\'m just scared of how everyone will treat me afterwards, I guess.\n\nAny advice that anyone can offer?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'ftm looking for advice', 'created': 1563926852.0}"

I don't know who here is religious, or spiritual, or believes in the power of the universe, etc. But I yelled at the universe today. And it answered back.

And how she's upset that the kids mess with this child, because they identify as trans, but they're still figuring themselves out. And she started to cry, and it was so specific that she brought this up so I started to tear up and I finally came out to her.

She accepts it. She even asked if I dressed up. It felt weird like I was being probed but she did it from a place of genuine curiosity and love and I showed her and she was very normal about it. Even asked me how I did my makeup. Like... WHAT!? We continued to talk and she knows. She knows that I still have questions. She knows that this may not be a phase and doesn‚Äôt care if it isn‚Äôt. She just wants me to know that she is accepting and still loves me. 

I still feel pretty depressed today. But I finally have some closure which is something I never thought I‚Äôd get, and almost gave up on. I honestly still have so many emotions going on in my head.

&gt;According to friends' and colleagues' online posts, Grigoryeva was worried about her safety after she found her name and personal information listed on the snuff site. 
&gt; 
&gt;‚ÄúI learned today that Lena asked a mutual friend to take care of her cat in the event of her death when she was threatened with murder,‚Äù [friend and fellow activist Dinar Idrisov wrote on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DinarSpbRu/posts/14256124609..). 
&gt; 
&gt;‚ÄúThe state of Russia was obliged to guarantee her the right to life,‚Äù Idrisov wrote. **‚ÄúLena and her lawyer appealed to law enforcement agencies both on the fact of violence and on the fact of threats, but there was no noticeable reaction.‚Äù** 
&gt; 
&gt;On Tuesday, Idrisov updated his post to note that Grigoryeva's mother had identified her body and that investigators in St. Petersburg had taken over the case. Other activists said on social media that Grigoryeva's body was found near her home over the weekend with stab wounds and signs of strangulation, The Moscow Times reported. 
&gt; 
&gt;On July 18, just **days before she was killed, Grigoryeva** [**posted an alert on her Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/lgbtnet/photos/a.17863967892..) **about the ‚ÄúSaw‚Äù website.** 
&gt; 
&gt;Grioryeva wrote that the site, which organizes a ‚Äúhunt for homosexual, bisexual and transgender people,‚Äù went online in spring 2018 and was shut down several times but always popped back up. **The website posted the personal data of ‚Äúpresumably LGBT+‚Äù activists, ‚Äúincluding photos and addresses,‚Äù and offered prizes to those who completed an attack.** 
&gt; 
&gt;**‚ÄúLaw enforcement agencies have still not done anything to find the creators of this ‚Äògame‚Äô and bring them to justice,‚Äù** Grigoryeva wrote. She called on those opposed to the website to contact the Russian prosecutor‚Äôs office and the FSB, Russia‚Äôs intelligence agency. 
&gt; 
&gt;‚ÄúIMPORTANT!‚Äù Grigoryeva wrote. ‚ÄúThe Russian LGBT network has repeatedly tried to find people affected by the actions of this group, but failed. We did not find a single attack case directly related to this group.‚Äù 
&gt; 
&gt;**Three days after her post, Grigoryeva was dead.** 

And finally, 

&gt;**Police in St. Petersburg confirmed she had reported being threatened repeatedly, but said the threats had not seemed a risk to her life and were related to domestic conflicts** with people she knew, the RBC media portal reported 

But *there's actually more*. An [article from the official Russian investigative committee site](https://sledcom.ru/news/item/1376526/) (Russian) also says that 

&gt;...a previously convicted man from the Kyrgyz Republic, born 1981, was detained-‚Äî 
&gt; 
&gt;She lead antisocial lifestyle and often got drunk, sometimes in the company of the suspect 

That's **Russian victim blaming classics**. Tell how bad and antisocial the victim was to imply that she *deserved* it and that her death is not significant anyway. Blame a foreigner who already was a criminal. A scum killed a scum during an argument, nothing to see here folks. And a big fat lie. A *social activis*t lead an *anti-social lifestyle*? Was repeatedly getting drunk with sketchy types? And he *just happened* to kill her right after her name appeared on an anti-gay website and she knew they were after her? It is not certain whether the suspect was a member of Saw (or just not said) but there are too many coincidences. 

&amp;#x200B; 

**LGBT people are forced to leave the country.** They receive death threats and threats that their loved ones will be killed. [Here are screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/qmDQwll) (Russian) of the threats Artyom Shitukhin, who is also on the list, received, and his story about how they tried to burn his house. 

In short, after the attempt he ran to Netherlands and they told him to pay for his friend's ticket too or he'll be dead in a few days. 

&amp;#x200B; 

**Tomorrow we may wake up to another victim.** Spread the word. How many people must die so Russian authorities acknowledge the problem? The world can't let it continue, can't let Russian LGBT people live in fear and wonder whether it's their last day alive. We need collective action to stop the gay hunting.

1314,2019-07-26 02:44:09,chx8r9,0,6,"Hey people! I‚Äôm a student in cosmetology school and I‚Äôm also a trans woman. I absolutely love helping people feel more like themselves and I try to put a lot of thought into how to accentuate masculine or feminine features using makeup or by changing hair styles. So here I‚Äôm gonna type out some of the major tips I have!

First you‚Äôll have to identify your face shape. The basic shapes are: oval, round, square, triangle, and heart shaped. For trans feminine people, usually you are looking to slim your face down, and round it out. For trans masculine people, you‚Äôll do the opposite, focusing on harsher lines and making your face more wide or flat.

So how do we do that? Soooo many ways! First we will focus on trans feminine people, since I know it best being a trans woman. You have so many options to explore! First let‚Äôs talk about hair, to be feminine you don‚Äôt have to have long hair. Long hair alone doesn‚Äôt bring out feminine features, but what you can do with that hair does. Bangs are great, but not all bangs are the same. Blunt bangs are beautiful, but the harsh line that it causes will make your face appear wider, and to an extent that continues to your shoulders and body because it leads your eyes to search for hard lines. Wispy bangs are my favorite choice, they are dense enough to cover up those pesky forehead lines, but they are still nice and flowy. For my short haired sisters, don‚Äôt be afraid of product! Personally I have a mullet with the sides shaved and I love using hairspray to keep it looking edgy. Wearing your hair going in a forward direction is usually a good idea, as most pixi cuts tend to motion forward.

Now for my trans masculine friends! This tends to be a lot easier to obtain, my greatest suggestion is to go to a barbershop or a salon and ask for a 321 fade, or if you are feeling real edgy, ask for a bald fade. And for the top, a comb over or pompadour work amazing, especially with a clean lineup. These will show your forehead more and look super clean with not too much product. Invest in some good quality pomade or styling clay. Paul Mitchell has some great options for everything men‚Äôs grooming, that‚Äôs what I use on all my men‚Äôs cut clients!

Makeup time! This also heavily relies on face shape because I‚Äôm gonna focus more on contour and highlight. Same rules apply as far as sliming and widening features, but this is where you can realllly make some magic. Trans feminine people, you‚Äôll want to contour your cheekbones to appear higher, to do this you can suck in your cheeks to find your cheek bones and then contour on or just above them, and then you can go in a c shape to above right by your eyebrow. My next favorite thing is to contour my jawline to make it seem softer and to make my chin look more flat and soft. This is super easy, all you have to do is apply contour to your jawline and blend it in. Boom, done. Highlight is super simple too, just a little bit above your cheekbones, between your brows, down the bridge of your nose, the tip of your nose, and sometimes your chin. Eyebrows go a long way too, you can do them in so many ways! Eyeshadow, pencil, pomade, try whatever you can and find your favorite! I use a pomade and I love it. Your main goal is to follow your natural brow, but soften and round off a little, also to fill in any more scarce places. Also go get your brows done! It feels amazing, and makes your life a lot easy when it comes to makeup. 

Now trans masculine people! Makeup typically isn‚Äôt viewed as masculine, but why can‚Äôt guys have fun with it too? My first tip of advice is to use a foundation that isn‚Äôt full coverage, this will let your skin look more natural but sill give you a bace for the rest of your look. Contour again is gonna be our friend. You‚Äôre gonna want to contour your cheekbones on or lower and then blend down. Make sure to really blend to keep that very natural look. With your brows, focus on making those very defined hard lines, I suggest either a pomade or pencil for this. 

That‚Äôs all I got guys! These were things that I wasn‚Äôt seeing much online and that I had to learn myself to help my dysphoria. Please if you have more advice put it down in the comments! And feel free to pm me if you need help!

So I‚Äôve been really productive all month. Been good for the majority of the time. Tuesday, started crashing and burning a little. Assumed I was just burnt out, right? Rest would fix that. Turns out, that‚Äôs not the case.

I‚Äôve been sleeping restlessly all week because I typically sleep in late, and I‚Äôve been trying to be mindful of my landlady, who‚Äôs showing off my apartment (I‚Äôm moving next month). So I‚Äôve set a thousand alarms from 8 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon. I usually am lights out by 2:30. So I‚Äôm not getting a whole ton of sleep.

Volunteering. I volunteer twice a week.  Called in sick earlier in the week. I have to go tomorrow though in order to get volunteer benefits from disability. So...hooray to that. Just great.

Finances are running low. Trying to pack. Trying to get my proof of citizenship paperwork. Wanting to apply for loans. Then, last night, I hear from my brother. Turns out, my estranged mother wants one of the designs she has of mine as a tattoo. She has two, on two mugs: a self-portrait I drew, and two koi fish. I, being a reasonably sane person, assume she wants the koi fish. Nope. She wants the manga-style, anatomy-void self-portrait I did several years ago that now looks nothing like me and, as it turns out, was from before I realized I was trans. Took a look at it today to see if I would be okay with it and....nooooooooooo.

1324,2019-07-26 08:17:17,ci05f2,1,1,"Forward note: Yes this is a throwaway account. I have friends and family who know my normal username, and nobody knows about any of this (the closest being a random offhand comment made to my mom). In addition, \*please\* don't take anything I say personally. Everything here will be entirely how \*I\* feel, about myself and my situation, and absolutely will not be aimed toward anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, here we go.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a cis woman in my 40s. I was born female, and accept that I am female. Despite that, and I know it's not 'the PC term' these days, the phrase 'man trapped in a woman's body' is how I feel. My hormones have been out of whack my whole life -- I tend to have more testosterone than usual, and have several times been mistaken as a man, especially when I used to wear sports bras. It genuinely feels like something got mixed up when I was being made. 

&amp;#x200B;

Being tans, though, doesn't appeal to me. It just feels too incomplete, a 'close enough' fix, like putting a band-aid on a wound that needs stitches. I am more than happy to support anyone who takes that route to be comfortable in their gender, but it's just not for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I would dearly like to do, though, is get rid of my breasts. They are annoying, inconvenient, uncomfortable, and quite frankly, useless. I'm asexual and aromantic (autochorissexual, to be exact), so it's not like I have (or want) anyone else interested in them. I got to thinking about that the other day, thanks to the aforementioned comment to my mom. I'd just gotten home from work on a blisteringly hot, muggy day, took off my bra and changed into house-clothes, and realized just how \*much\* my breasts bother me. I told mom that, if I could, I'd just get rid of 'em altogether just so I wouldn't have to deal with 'em anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

And once I got to thinking about it, there are really only two things that keep me from doing it: The cost, and... well, my nipples. They're sensitive enough that they tend to be a big part of 'alone time'; I do \*not\* want to lose that, but don't know if surgery would affect them. (I am unhappy enough with having lady parts that, quite frankly, I need all the help I can get.)

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't have the first clue where to start researching something like that, though, or if I'd ever go through with it. I know I'd have support from my family if I did, so it comes down to a personal choice. I dunno. Just that random comment had all this running around in my head, and I needed to write it out, I guess.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you've made it this far, thank you for reading through my rambling post. If you have any advice, suggestions, or anything, I'd be happy to have them.

My boyfriend and I went to the beach yesterday with some friends and we encountered a pretty intamate issue while in the ocean.

We weren't binding because with our combined rib problems, the 30 degree heat and I don't want it to degrade because I can't get another one. I managed to convince our friends to go to a beach with a minimal amount of people and we wore the baggiest shirts in my BF's wardrobe so we were relatively safe.

I think what must have happened was the loose clothing rubbed up against our chests while we were swimming, the added salt creating some friction, because after about ten minutes our nipples were in near agony and it only got worse the whole time we swam.

The problem actually got worse about an hour after we got home from the beach and we realised that actually there were little tiny cuts on our nips that weren't there before and they'd been irritated to the point where they were open and red. It was painful 100% of the time and near impossible to shower.

We both have quite sensitive skin which can't have helped. A friend had the same issue last year but he just took off his shirt and it went away but we obviously can't do that.

Has anyone experienced this? 

I thought about putting little plasters or tape over the area but again, I'm not sure if that would help. I'm not sure if a binder wouldn't just make it worse. And like I said, I couldn't afford another one if the ocean ruined it.

I am not sure if any of you are familiar with this theory, but I feel that it is very applicable to the idea of transitioning, as long as you disregard some of Rogers more...problematic early attitudes towards homosexuality (he thought it was a form of neurosis). 

According to this theory a person has two ""selfs."" One is the ""actual self,"" and this is the version of themselves that they present to the world. The other is the ""ideal self,"" which is the version of themselves they have in their mind. The further apart these two selves are, the more incongruence the individual will experience. The incongruence they feel leads to neurosis like anxiety, depression and, in the case of as trans person, gender dysphoria. 

The principal goal of any individual is to achieve congruence, a state in which these selfs are in alignment, a process which Rogers refers to as self-actualization. According to Rogers it is impossible to achieve true congruence, but you can get very close, at which point it is a process that goes on throughout your life as your actual self and your ideal self change and grow, and that the best way to help with this process is with the aid of another congruent person, especially if you are in a severe state of incongruence.

So a little nearly 3 years ago I made the second biggest mistake of my life, I came out as Bi to my parents. They claimed they accepted me but in hindsight they started treating me significantly worse. About 7 months later, still thinking they accepted me, I made what is the single bigger mistake of my life - I told them something at the time only 2 other people knew. I told them that I am MTF transgender. I got grounded for a week and they went through my phone, deleted anything remotely feminine, and would only give it back if I agreed to let them go through whenever they want (which they still use more often than I can explain, but now I hide everything and they haven‚Äôt found anything). When I finally got my own car about 1 year ago, they installed a tracking app on my phone that gives my Mom (they worse of the 2) a notification when I enter/leave a 2 km (about 1 mile) radius of home, whenever I exceed 50km per hour (about 31 mph), and they can look at a live map of where I am at anytime and how fast I‚Äôm moving. They also threw out all my traditionally feminine clothing (and wigs, make-up, and anything that had my preferred name on it) and grounded me for another month about a year ago when they found it all after of keeping it hidden for 18 months).

There‚Äôs a lot more that they do but that‚Äôs the important stuff. I‚Äôve been dealing with a lot of Dysphoria recently and there‚Äôs no real way to secretly wear and dress what I want and even just doing something as small as shaving my armpits last month got my phone taken away for a day. What do I do? How can I cope with GD? The biggest roadblock for me is the nearest LGBTQ+ centre is a 2 hour drive from me, but I doesn‚Äôt have overnight services and is a 9-5 establishment. If I want to go one that has overnight I have to drive 6hrs to an airport then take a 2 hour flight, or drive for about 20 hours straight to the city.

1378,2019-07-27 02:16:02,cibxbd,2,1,"I was born female, and when I was nine I became very jealous of the boys and I envied them, I can't explain why, but that's how I thought. I started getting extremely uncomfortable with my body, and I have an older sister, so I had an idea of what my body was going to look like once I started developing. I would watch how the boys around me would act and I would try to be like them. From the way I talked, looked, etc. From there it got worse. When I turned 10, I got my hair cut really short and I was extremely happy. I felt like one of the boys, and looked like a boy (I don't have a very feminine looking face to begin with). I moved and attended a new school. Once I arrived to my new class, all my classmates thought I was a guy. I felt confident. But they found out I wasn't a boy and I got anxious. (I have bad social anxiety as well, my mom is the cause of it but that's another story). I also started hitting puberty at this time. I was so uncomfortable with my chest that I wore big men's hoodies all the time, everyday, even in the summer. It started getting bad there. I honestly did not shower a lot because I hated looking at my body. When I was 12, I said goodbye to primary/elementary school and hopped over to middle school. It all continued mostly the same, but having to go into the girl's changing room and all that really ate me alive. All of my friends were guys and I hated that I was always seperated from them and put into things for girls. Anyway, one day, a friend of mine came up to me and asked me - ""Are you transgender?"" and I said ""What is that?"". He said to me - ""If you're transgender, it means you were born one gender and really want to be another one"". I scoffed and said no, but I needed to know more about this. I knew I felt this way and I wanted an explanation as to why I did feel that way and how I could change it. I didn't do too much research, but I did enough. While I did that, I found out that being transgender is a pretty contreversial thing and a lot of people were against it. Esentially it seemed pretty taboo. After a while of thinking, I came to the conclusion that I was transgender. But I was scared to say anything. Extremely afraid. I told a terrible old friend of mine and she belittled me a lot about it. I remember this one thing she said - ""You were born a girl. Fucking act like one. Maybe if you put makeup on and acted like a girl, you wouldn't feel that way."" I went home and had a really bad anxiety attack. So, I started wearing makeup, and a lot of it. I did get made fun of for presenting more as a boy by a lot of classmates and even my mom as it was, so I tried really hard to act feminine. It destroyed me, and I can't explain why I did it, but I did. I got a really positive reaction from it, and maybe I should've been happy that way, but I wasn't. Maybe my friend was wrong. I felt disgusting but people weren't questioning me/making fun of me anymore. I tried to kill myself that summer. I started cutting my body up a lot and even burning myself. It didn't work, and I didn't tell anyone at the time. A while later, I had very, very bad suicidal thoughts and CONSTANT anxiety attacks for about 3 months straight. Even thinking about it scares me and that occured years ago. After time passed, I went back to being myself and presenting how I wanted to. I was happy. Eventually, I came out as transgender to the person who has been the love of my life since I was 7. She was extremely supportive and I felt amazing. Then I came out to my friends, their reactions were mostly positive. A few people said I was an attention seeker and stuff like that, but I was euphoric and didn't care. And the shit starts here. I came out to my mother. She said ""*My birth name* I will always support you. If it makes you happy, be who you are. You are my kid. I will always love you."" I cried. I was so happy. It was all working out. I wanted to get my hair cut again and get more clothes from the mens section. Then, after a while of me coming out... say 2 months later? I asked my mom to slowly try calling me my preferred name and using he/him pronouns. She laughed in my face and rolled her eyes, saying 'Yeah, okay, sure' in a extremely sarcastic voice. My heart sank. The name I chose (with the help of my amazing friends) was Tobias. I asked her to call me that. A few times a week, she would call me my name in a super mean way and laugh at me. She told me I was just doing it all for attention. All the hope I had in the situation left me, I felt like I had nothing as time went on. My depression (which has been with me since I can remember), was getting worse. Then I told all of my friends that ""I'm not transgender, I was jist depressed"". Which wasn't true, I just didn't want my mom to go off on me anymore. Some of my friends supported me, and my other 'friends' told me I was an attention whore. I went back to presenting female. I was sick everyday, I ate way way less, I rarely had a shower, I avoided everyone and was mean to everyone, and I slept all day. Everyday. Eventually, I ended up trying to take my life again. I wrote a letter and at the top I wrote, and I quote - ""MOM THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT. YOU BITCH YOU RUINED ME I FUCKING HATE YOU."" She worked the night shift sometimes and she was at work the time I attempted. She never found out about it. The note, everything. I woke up the next morning and threw up. I felt so sick and fucking furious. I got better though. Then I started presenting as a boy. My therapists and everything did not believe I was transgender even after months and months of explaining and ranting to them about it which made me feel terrible because I wasn't getting help (It's still the same. They take it as a joke.) I came out as trans again a year later. I told my mom I would not listen to her shit and that I would not respond to her if she made fun of me or called me my birthname. So many people called me an attention whore, a ""transtrender"", etc, without  knowing any details of the story. But a few people supported me. Same thing happened as the first time with my mom making fun of me for it. But it was worse this time. Being called an attention whore, a fake bitch and a ""transtrender"" started to get to me. And a guy I really liked felt the same back. It all hit me and I said the same thing as the first time - 'I'm just depressed I'm not trans'. I started cutting so bad and started making myself throw up and planned my suicide. I was put into the mental health part of the hospital and had to stay there for a while, but I didn't get any help. I've been out for a while now. I'm still really struggling with it. And I love my boyfriend, but he's the type of person that 'supports' me but tries to guilt trip me out of transitioning, but only for his benefit. I'm still presenting as a girl. I know I don't have to, but it keeps people happy. Other than me. Please help me, someone, anyone. I would give my soul away not to feel this. 

Also, I'm much happier and my depression is pretty well gone (other than the trans thing). I moved out from my mom and I live with my amazing Dad.

From a very young age I had issues with accepting who I was. I was always a difficult child to deal with, wanting to do the opposite of what I thought was right. I had a love for breaking the rules and doing what was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù. 

Later in life when I discovered what sexuality was, I stuck to my old ways and wanted to break those norms I had built up in my head. Men are to be with women, and that‚Äôs that. I started to experiment and thought homosexuality wasn‚Äôt for me. However I kept finding myself being interested in the male form. I‚Äôd feel disgusted at myself for even thinking about it. This led me down years of self hatred and mental issues I still have not gotten over. 

After a short time in counseling, I had come to terms with myself that I could be bisexual. Being happy with myself I continued on with my life. 

Without going into too much detail, I found myself being curious about the sexual nature of the male form and learned to explore myself in other ways. That led me to realizing I had a cross dressing fetish. 

While strictly for sexual purposes, I would dress up and do makeup to please myself or partners, to sort of ‚Äúfit the part‚Äù of a bottom better. 

After awhile I started dating my current girlfriend of 5 years. I hung up my clothes and began starting a heterosexual relationship. I introduced her to my habits and the collection of toys I‚Äôd acquired over the years didn‚Äôt set her off, but my collection of women‚Äôs clothes was a bit odd to her. We eventually moved beyond that and It was no longer weird, but wasn‚Äôt something we would utilize on a regular basis. 

Most recently, I started to notice I had moments where I would do something considered feminine. I‚Äôd started growing out my hair about two years ago, and I‚Äôd style it in ways that were very feminine(at least to me). 

I started questioning wether or not I could be a trans woman, when all of the sudden I got hit in the face with the most amount of self hatred mixed with depression I had ever experienced. I would only experience these feelings when I was aroused, but would quickly dissipate to hatred when I wasn‚Äôt, the same way I felt when I was questioning my sexuality.

Wear men's‚Ñ¢Ô∏è deodorant and use men's‚Ñ¢Ô∏è body wash!!! I've always used typical feminine smelling stuff because I was terrified of being outted before I was ready, but I can't wait to start smelling like a man that way!!!

Get my hair cut short!!! I've always overcompensate by having really, really long hair. It's been such a nuisance my whole life and oh my god, I cannot wait to chop it all off and see what I look like with a short man's‚Ñ¢Ô∏è cut!!! I have no clue what style I'm gonna go for but deciding has been fun so far!!!

Getting a binder eventually/soon!!! I've never experienced very much gender dysphoria, but what I have experienced has been centered around my breasts. I'm definitely going to get top surgery in the future, but for now I can't wait to start wearing a binder instead of a bra!!! 

Having sex with someone who uses correctly gendered terms for me and my body parts! I won't go into detail obviously but I have an amazingly understanding and compassionate life partner who's as excited as I am to explore and realize what I like to hear in bed! 

I'm not ready to start talking to doctors about T or surgeries or anything like that yet, but oh my god am I so super excited to start doing the little things. It's gonna make my life so much happier and special and comfortable!!!! üò≠üíôüíôü§©

I won't go into detail obviously but I have an amazingly understanding and compassionate life partner who's as excited as I am to explore and realize what I like to hear in bed! \n\nI'm not ready to start talking to doctors about T or surgeries or anything like that yet, but oh my god am I so super excited to start doing the little things. It's gonna make my life so much happier and special and comfortable!!!! üò≠üíôüíôü§©\n\nSo to anyone at this stage of transition or anyone thinking or too scared about coming out, look forward to the little adjustments.

So I played in a show and one of the people who played there with me is a transwoman. So after the show I sat there with my parents and next to us there were some people who watched the show and they were talking about the show. They talked about how the character she played was called ‚Äûshima‚Äú  (they called her ‚Äûhe‚Äú) and how they thought that the name came from the word ‚Äûshe-male‚Äú.
So I turned to them and said:
‚ÄûShe was called like this as a reference to Hiroshima‚Äú
And they went like: ‚Äû ohh no don‚Äôt tell me that, it would have fit so perfect. But he‚Äôs a man right?‚Äú
And I was like ‚ÄûNo, she is a Woman‚Äú

And I said :‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have to care about that. Anyway, I have to go back inside now.‚Äú
And then I just went inside (because I started to feel kinda uneasy)

So should I have explained it more? I mean, I was in a really bad mood that day, but that is no excuse.

After thinking about it a little more though, I realized that it's probably something that I'd want to do at some point, though I'm still kinda afraid of it. Is that normal as well?

1540,2019-07-29 17:16:15,cje8mr,5,3,"Hey everybody, cishet dude here, and I need a little insight.

Let‚Äôs talk about my friend first, who I‚Äôll be calling Charlie. Now I‚Äôve known this tomboyish girl since elementary school, and have been best friends with her since high school.  We share a lot of similar interests in anime, games, art, and comics, and I always hang out at her house, especially during summer break (we went to different high schools).  It wasn‚Äôt until half-a-year-ago that she came out to me as a transgender male, and honestly, I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt realize it sooner!  Our friendship hasn‚Äôt changed at all, and we‚Äôre hanging out more than ever thanks to being high school graduates now.  His parents are out-of-country right now, and they are half-supportive-half-concerned about him transitioning.  For one, his parents have known about his coming out since early middle school (6 years or so), and some personal conceptions or experiences have had them believe it was ‚Äújust a phase.‚Äù  Well, it really ain‚Äôt a phase anymore!  Until they permanently return to the country in a year or so, Charlie is going to have to wait even longer on possibly beginning his transition.  He has been having counseling, at the very least, supporting their gender identity and transition.
A semi-important point is that I live fairly close to a popular urban city in the Southeastern U.S. that‚Äôs very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community, and the university Charlie and I are attending is for it as well.

Now, the obstacle isn‚Äôt me facing the truth about Charlie, never has been and probably never will be.  It‚Äôs me facing my PARENTS facing the truth about Charlie. Now let‚Äôs talk about them.  
For their age, I think my parents are on the line between being conservative or progressive, and the local community may have had an impact on their conceptions of LGBTQ+ in recent years.  My father is seemingly much more laid back about progressive topics; maybe he‚Äôs an ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù kind of person, as I can‚Äôt recall any encounters between him and LGBTQ+ people.  If anything, he‚Äôs more concerned that the friends I‚Äôm with are safe and responsible (which Charlie pretty much is), and that I myself am making responsible decisions and working hard.  My mother is slightly less laid back, and if anything, they‚Äôre curious about it.  She seems to be a partially devout Catholic (doesn‚Äôt have a lot of time to attend church services, so she makes up through social media posting about her faith and family). One time, my mom asked me if I should try dating a bi girl I knew, and I told her that she had a girlfriend at that time. Iirc, she didn‚Äôt say much, but she thankfully didn‚Äôt make any weird critiques or statements on me or my choice of friends.

It can be seen that my parents don‚Äôt agree nor disagree with the idea of LGBTQ+ people, but what would happen if I try to change their conception of one person that they never knew was transgender?  Whenever I mention Charlie, I have to get in the mindset of talking about ‚ÄúCharlotte,‚Äù and repeating that dead name ends up leaving me confused sometimes and accidentally using it when talking to Charlie. Hell, I have to do it when talking to Charlie‚Äôs parents, since they‚Äôre still iffy on supporting his transition.  It sucks having to talk/text the parents about ‚ÄúCharlotte‚Äù and not Charlie.
If I tell them the truth, what should I do if they press me for further questioning, or try to contact his parents if they are supportive about it? Despite me being somewhat independent, would they try to have their word on who I should/shouldn‚Äôt be friends with? It‚Äôs those ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù that concern me.

Now, the easiest solution would seem to be to simply not tell my parents the truth.  Out of sight, out of mind, right?  Not really.  Charlie and I are going to stick together through college and probably our adult lives as well, and beating around the bush and lying to my parents isn‚Äôt really going to help. It‚Äôs just going to make the eventual revelation harder to understand (unless I somehow take this all to my grave?)

Another solution would be saying something like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something I have to tell you guys‚Äù and sitting them down to talk about my friend coming out would probably make them think that *I* am the one coming out, and cause further confusion. 

Reflecting on it, I am very nonchalant about Charlie‚Äôs coming out.  If I have that same kind of attitude when telling my parents, would they be nonchalant about it as well? 
‚ÄúHey! so charlotte is actually a guy, he‚Äôs charlie! ok talk to you later love ya‚Äù 
(...okay maybe that‚Äôs too casual).  But basically, could treating it like it‚Äôs not a big deal work?

In my 10th grade year my dad got hurt on the job, he went on the sue the company, During the time period while he waited for a settlement he start a crappy business which he operates under my name to avoid workers comp from finding out he is making other income which did cost quite a large amount of money, and it lead him to force me staying up long hours on the computer since this was some internet get rich quick thing he found on youtube, My grades started to slip since I could never stay awake though I was able to manage 10th grade year and at the end the business fails , 11th grade year comes around and he doesn't have a business for the first semester, but he starts saying he needs to move, this is the worst thing that could of happened, since jumpstart isn't honored outside of Louisiana and usually ends up with students being very behind, in the second semester he starts yet another business and keeps it semi under my name, He somehow invest quite a bit and a lot more than last time, He had opportunities to actually make money with this but would yell and hit me when I told him he shouldn't buy more merchandise since he hasn't sold the current stock yet, toward the middle of second semester his settlement get in, He now has a ton of money but soon the threats of moving come back, and he confirms he is moving around this time I have already given up in school considering the state of Texas would refuse to reconize any of my technical classes, He moves in end part of April this is extermelly depressing, I get to school and they tell that I am very behind and that I may have to take a extra and go to summer school both years, Which would also mean only seeing my mom once a year for two years and with my grandmother dying this wasn't a good option for me, and to move in with my mom at 18 I would have to drop or she would be voliting a court order since it states until I turn 18 or I graduate from high school which ever once comes later, I am aware I likely won't be able to afford collage until im in my mid 20's since no one in their right mind would give someone with little to no real world work experience and a dropout with a GED a 10,000 dollar student loan, also if I don't go to collage within one year I loose the 10,000 Arkansas would give me for collage so it's now 20,000.

1570,2019-07-30 02:56:52,cjloid,1,0,"Hi all! My name is Amelia, I'm a 20 year old MtF and about 2 months into my transition. I've been having an itch to tell the story of the time I came out to my extended family and how my mother really made things difficult in the long-run, I figured I would just dump it on r/trans to open a wider discussion on the topic. This may get a bit long as it requires some backstory, so grab some popcorn! 

TL;DR: years of refusing to use my pronouns lead to my mum telling my family to call me by a name that she chose rather than the one I chose.

I initially came out to my parents when I was 16, I had always had underlying feelings of being trans but at the same time I was still unbelievably scared and confused as to what was going through my head. My mum and I have always had a fairly good relationship so I trusted her enough to admit what I was going feeling and thinking. I told her about what gender dysphoria was and that I wanted to start transitioning into a woman. This was met with... mixed reactions, on one hand she was trying her utmost feign support for me, but even I could seen under the facade of smiles and sweetness she was freaking out about the entire thing, she give me the usual lines that I'm sure you've all heard, ""But you like boy things so much."" ""Why cant you just be a feminine guy?"" etc. This affected me pretty badly as I was still struggling with my own emotions alone, now I was dealing with her insecurity on the matter. Eventually after a bad run in with a very judgemental therapist, I forced my way back into the closet and we went on pretending like this had never happened.

Flash forward to November of 2018 and my desire to transition came back HARD. I mean like harder than ever before. fell into a pretty deep depression for about a month, finally coming to the conclusion that I'm never going to be happy unless I bite the bullet and just start hrt. I pulled my mum aside and told her what was going to happen, again she was hesitant but less so this time. She said she would try and support me through the whole thing, ironically following up with some classic ""I'm going to lose my son"" lines. These didn't work, however. I had chosen once and for all that this was my path and I'd be damned if someone was going to stop me now.

For the most part I was extremely excited about the future. My parents were on board with my decision, albeit reluctantly. and I was making progress, slowly. The most important thing to me at the beginning was coming out to everyone else. how I was going to do it and who I wanted to tell first. Our family is pretty big so I decided to tell people in smaller groups. The opportunity arose when my grandparents, aunt, uncle and two kids were planning on coming over for dinner, I stupidly told mum about my plan but I was still hesitant after she basically forced me to come out to my brother out of desperation and the fact she thought I was lying to him by doing this, this was mistake number one.

As dinner finished up we all moved to the living room, this was it, now or never, time to finally come out with it. I managed to utter out that I need to talk, and just got right into it. I admitted my feelings and told them of my plan to transition. I also made it clear that this shouldn't be taboo or a dirty secret, that who I am isn't a page in the dirt sheets that they dare not talk about, as long as they are respectful I am happy to be open or answer any questions. For the most part it went as smooth as you could ask for, there was a lot of confusion, a lot of support and a lot more questions! This is when the subject of pronouns got brought up, things started to go downhill from here.

Now an important note here and one of the worst things about my dealing with my family is that they have decided they dont want to use my pronouns or call my by my preferred name. I was essentially a bystander in a decision about my own pronouns which frustrates me a lot, especially when it comes to my brother. He will call me things like 'bro' or 'man' and when I tell him to stop he responds with ""Well you ARE my brother, arent you?"" or ""That's just what you are"" which is extremely transphobic if you ask me.

So, back to the discussion, my aunt asked me ""What are we supposed to call you now?"" and before I can even answer, my mum says ""Oh we're not using (deadname)'s pronouns just yet, it's too confusing and we want to wait."" Which just left me speechless, the absolute AUDACITY to answer for me, especially on something I feel so strongly about, it's like she thinks that my pronouns are a group decision for everyone involved to vote on. She continued: ""As for names I was thinking something like Kira would suit him."" Now personally, I hate the name Kira for myself (No disrespect to any Kiras out there, it's just not for me!) It's far too close to my deadname for me to even consider. I responded by saying that I'm still deciding on a name but I'm fond of the name Amelia, to which my mum responds ""Nonsense, I'm your mother and I get a say in what your name is!"" I believe this was bordering on a joke but I could feel the genuine energy when she said it, the whole thing was insulting nonetheless.  


At this point, I was frustrated but it wasn't the end of the world, I could still  convince everyone to use my pronouns eventually. This was when my grandma came into the room, looked at me and said ""Would you like a drink, Kira?"" Internally I was screaming. My mother basically just declared my name and now people were using it, I dont blame my grandmother, she was still wrapping her head around the whole thing so it wasn't her fault. Eventually as everyone left I just sat there in dumbfounded thought. My mum had hijacked the conversation, told everyone without my permission to just forget about using my pronouns and was now chatting to me like nothing had happened. 

Later down the line I came out to plenty of other people but every time my mum has been there and she has tried the same trick every time I've tried to stop her but it doesn't seem to be working. Now my entire family arent even bothering with pronouns, making it really difficult when I just want to be Amelia, not Kira, not deadname, only who I am meant to be. I know it isn't the end of the world and in the broader sense I'm very lucky to have parents that are even trying to support me in the first place. even if it is very rocky support.

My name is Amelia, I\'m a 20 year old MtF and about 2 months into my transition. I\'ve been having an itch to tell the story of the time I came out to my extended family and how my mother really made things difficult in the long-run, I figured I would just dump it on r/trans to open a wider discussion on the topic. This may get a bit long as it requires some backstory, so grab some popcorn! \n\nTL;DR: years of refusing to use my pronouns lead to my mum telling my family to call me by a name that she chose rather than the one I chose.\n\nI initially came out to my parents when I was 16, I had always had underlying feelings of being trans but at the same time I was still unbelievably scared and confused as to what was going through my head. My mum and I have always had a fairly good relationship so I trusted her enough to admit what I was going feeling and thinking. I told her about what gender dysphoria was and that I wanted to start transitioning into a woman. This was met with... mixed reactions, on one hand she was trying her utmost feign support for me, but even I could seen under the facade of smiles and sweetness she was freaking out about the entire thing, she give me the usual lines that I\'m sure you\'ve all heard, ""But you like boy things so much."" ""Why cant you just be a feminine guy?"" etc. This affected me pretty badly as I was still struggling with my own emotions alone, now I was dealing with her insecurity on the matter.

I searched for a long time for an option other than transitioning to deal with my dysphoria. I have yet to come up with one that works. So I decided to start transitioning, I came out to everyone and shit hit the fan. Now I'm in this limbo living situation. It will change within the next few weeks to be better which is great. But damn does leaving everything behind fucking hurt so much. I miss my friends, and my old life a lot. I just feel like I'm not the person I want to be. I don't like who I am. I feel like I'm just trudging through life right now taking punch after punch trying to figure my shit out. One thing that has always been present is this huge fear that I won't enjoy who I am during or after the transition. That my dysphoria will run rampant and I'll have thrown away what I had working for me as a man at the very least. So, I'm scared. I'm terrified actually.

1650,2019-07-31 12:53:20,ck84b6,1,4,"So... a bit of info before 20yo MtF

I came out to my parents about 2 months ago, this is something ive had on the back of my mind for around 6 years but only have thought about it seriously after i ended my relationship with my previous partner last october.

I started with my mom since my dad is not at home for the majority of the day. At first she said that she had been ""suspecting"" something for a while and was trying to find out my opinion on trans people. She didnt really know how to react and she said that she loved me no matter what. 

After that she said some stuff that made me realize that she really didnt have a clue about what was going on. She was concerned about her ""son"" being a completely different person, i tried to convince her that im not a different person, that im the ""son"" that she knows, im just not comfortable in my body, the way people refer to me and not being able to do stuff commonly associated with being feminine.

Still she didnt get it and asked me very insistently about why and when as if she didnt believe this ""son"" of her was actually a woman. I got really offended by her not believing me and being questioned about it as if it was a crime. After that i acted really cold towards her for a couple of days and she was trying to research about trans people, she got to the conclusion tht i was getting depressed because of being trans and got really worried about me hurting myself, i got even more offended and was very angry at her for a while, it got to the point that my dad had to speak to me about it.

Turns out my mom told him literally right after i told her without consulting me. My dad is an artist and knows quite some people that are lgbt, I thought he was gonna be more wise about this but it didnt turn out very well. 

For context i live in the northern region of M√©xico and theres still a lot of backlash against lgbt people. He was trying to make me ""change my mind"", as if this was something i chose to be, all this because he knows ""how miserable"" these people are and how they, at least in the art environment where he works,  just try to distract themselves with work so they dont have to think about their pain.

He said some very hurtful stuff and and questioned me much more harshly because he ""knows me"", i was just wishing i had never told them and then he told me that the only important thing i needed to take from that conversation is that i was making my mom suffer because the only thing she has always been proud of was her ""son"" and now ""he"" turned out like this.

Basically im being forced to be in the closet until i leave the house and im literally prohibited from being overly feminine.

3 days ago my family came back from a vacation trip, a trip i didnt want to go, i used all that time to be as girly as i wanted, i wore my first dress, i wore make up for the first time and so, i was so happy being finally able to be what i wanted to and now i have to pretend to be a boy again.

As you all know coming out is not exactly a piece of cake..
I know my mom is semi supportive (saying that as I'm not exactly sure where I have her, she might be very supportive!)
My father is not so..
Now they are not together anymore, so at least I can tell them one by one.

Also another issue here is that I live by myself in a different country and I don't want to do it over the phone/text or video chat.

But once my mom is here I wish to tell her.

Is there any good way to transition over to the topic and to maybe probe and see what she thinks of it before I come out?

A bit of context: In my country, nonbinary is hardly a thing. I tested the water with my endo... she insist on me having top surgery everytime ( I am not interested and not in need) and have hard time to refers to me as a masculine person (it shouldn't matter but I pass most of the time too pre-t, so it's basically because she knows I am female and not her typical FTM patient)... soooooo

It's not like I have other options, I am happy I could start HRT even if I was clear with her that I won't be on T forever (she was hella confused).

&amp;#x200B;

I have no clue what low dose is for gel, I am not even sure if that's what I want. But I was wondering, what if I want to keep going with that dose because I feel good that way? is it good dose, in the sense is it healty? My endo thinks only in terms of what's ""normal man value"".

I am fine with the changes that a normal dose would give, so I'm not worried from that point of view, it's more that I know I can't pull the rope too much with my doctor, she reads these things like me not being sure - there is man and woman and one way to be - I guess that in the end she wants my money so I hope she won't refuse me as patient, because it's wiser to ask her this question. I just feel a bit lost, because in the mind of many doctors (and trans people unfortunately) there is ONE path to follow, so each part is a step toward the next and not itself an interesting journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I am just worring for no reason. Luckily my therapist is totally into gender fluidity, but we are both aware of the country we live in and the paper she made for me is all about me being a trans man, to help me have access to whatever I feel right for myself legally and medically.

Hi folks! Just a quick story! So on a day to day basis, I dress and act pretty masculine, all things considered. I have very close friends who are aware that I like to crossdress, but aside from that small group of queer-friendly folks that I've known for a few years, the crossdressing thing is just a me thing. ""No one is home, I'm gonna get all dressed up and watch TV in my room"" kinda thing, or I'll go over to those friends' houses with my clothes, get all dressed up, come out and watch TV with them and have a girls' night. 

&amp;#x200B;

Except last night, on the Fourth of July, I went to a work party. I want to preface this story by saying, unlike in most jobs I've had, I genuinely get along with and love all my coworkers. They're good people. I trust all of them a ton. So two of my three bosses, my office's secretary, and probably 12 coworkers and I are all pretty drunk talking about work. I have no idea what the context is, or even if there was context beforehand, but I basically went up to the secretary and was like ""Hey wanna know something wicked personal about myself?"" and she was like ""Fuck yeah I do."" And, I showed her my pictures. This was already a weird choice. I was drunk, not sure what I was thinking. She was supportive of it and we talked about it and some friends she has. This is the part where, logically I should have said ""Cool, an ally."" and then not told anyone else. Except I was drunk so I did. I basically showed everyone in management because they're all who I'm closest with. They all seemed to be supportive, but I can't remember for sure because, let me reiterate: I was, REALLY drunk. Because I'd never tell anyone this otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

So now everyone in management is aware. I'm giddy and stuff because I'm like ""Wow it feels kinda nice not having it be a secret, so cool. Lookit all these friends.""

&amp;#x200B;

And the next day rolls around. I wake up this morning, sober(and hungover) and immediately I'm ashamed. It's not that I'm ashamed of being into the culture, I'm not. I was embarrassed that I, in my drunken stupor, thought it'd be appropriate to run around my boss's house with my phone and show them what I do on the weekends like someone might talk about their weekend golf trip. I see my boss in the morning, I smile, say hi and carry on with my day like last night didn't actually happen. I kind of pray to myself no one says anything. Before my boss goes home, she comes up to me and says ""Hey, uh, before you go, can you check your cubby?"" and I say sure. The cubby is where we put paperwork that needs to be signed, stuff like that. Weirdly, I was scared it'd be some kinda harassment paper or something. Like maybe last night was SUPER uncalled for and someone complained. More embarrassment.

&amp;#x200B;

The shift ends. I clock out. I go to my cubby. What do I find? 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss bought me makeup. 

&amp;#x200B;

It was like, the coolest way to tell me she was an ally. I couldn't believe it. This boss, of all the managers, is the one I'm never sure like, how she feels about me. I'm kind of a spaz at work, and my personality is probably awkward for people. But getting the makeup from her was like. I dunno. The confirmation felt insane. What a girl. I'll never forget this.

I've always been attracted to people of all genders my whole life but my two LTRs were with men and ery heteronormative relationships where I just suppressed these other sides of me. I got out of LTR w a cishet man last year (we were engaged). I have dated/done physical stuff with girls in the past but never slept with a woman and I want to explore this but also I'm REALLY scared, I feel like I am now too old to be a virgin and I'm terrified of judgement! I tried to speak to one girl on a date about this earlier this year, after learning all this she said I was ""trying things out"" and said she wouldn't be my ""phase"" which really knocked my confidence.  


In terms of me, I feel very happy on my own at home not assigning myself a label and just enjoying the experience of being me.

I DO like she/her in romantic contexts (i.e. on dates). growing up I was always ""tomboy"""" etc I have a very assertive/dominant personality which resulted in my being the ""alpha male"" and so on. previously I liked the acknowledgement of the ""masculine"" energy I possess although I think now it was messy to characterise my personality that way and probably there was underlying confusion as I never felt like I adhered to the concept of woman.  


I would really like to find other people/community to talk to about this but I don't know where to start and all of my friends are white cishet people so I genuinely don't know how I would even broach the topic!

46,2019-07-06 15:02:06,c9uin4,5,8,"I'm a 20-something lesbian, and have been a wonderful relationship with a transgirl for about six months. Anyway, a few weeks ago, she introduced me to a few nonbinary friends of hers and we got to talking about gender, the binary, and all that fun stuff. They said something to me about more people are probably nonbinary than they think and what got them questioning was how GNC they were before identifying as nonbinary. 

Before the conversation, I never really thought much about my gender. I've always known I was a girl and liked being a girl. Sure, I'm not the most feminine woman in the world but I always wear makeup out and love dresses and such, but also wear guys' clothes on occasion as well (I'm wearing men's basketball sorts as I'm writing this). In fact, Ive even done some drag king before and enjoy. Despite my feminine expression and some interests, I've always been a tomboy.

 So I'm feeling absolutely terrified to post this, but I know I need to at least tell somebody. 

Okay, so I was watching a documentary about trans youth in Los Angeles. I've been repressing my gender identity confusion for a long time. Then, it hit me. It hit me that I might be a more effeminate male. I burst into heavy sobs, until I couldn't cry anymore. 

. I'm getting a bit emotional writing this, right now. I've always had body issues and puberty seemed to amplify it. I hit puberty when I was nine and remember feeling frustrated that my breasts were beginning to grow. I was so angry that I felt ""out of control"" of my body and I was angry with my mother. I thought puberty and becoming a ""woman"" were ""scary"" things that happened to adults, not to a nine year old who still watched ""Little Bear"".
 I just never felt I belonged in my body, male or female. I feel lost and it's still hard to look in the mirror and often feel disassociated from my body. I know there's a good chance I may be male, especially if these thoughts aren't going away. I keep gaslighting myself and telling myself that I'm just ""mentally ill"" or ""crazy"" (narcissistic family members loved to use these phrases towards me generally, with my reactions to the abuse or calling out the past abuse) or that its just my body image issues. I'm also a survivor of sexual abuse throughout my childhood and adulthood and I know that can warp ones sense of identity and cause victims to question our very core of identity.

 I'm struggling to come to the conclusion whether my issues are trauma/body image-related and/or related to possible gender dysphoria. I've struggled with depression, eating disorders, self-harm, among other serious mental health issues. I'm in therapy now and I see her in two days. I definitely need someone more trauma and gender-focused. I've doubted myself for a long time, with a mixture of my own thoughts and what others tell me.

 I've met very few people who are both trans and survivors of sexual abuse in-person. Basically, I'm feeling very confused and this is my first time writing about it.

I do feel that I would over all be happy if I were the other gender, but I wouldn't be devastated if I lived my life without transitioning. I feel as though the best medium would be to have a more ""androgynous"" look. I'm wondering if I can take hormones without growing breasts, that's the biggest concern that I have. The rest, I wouldn't care much about. Can you take Spiro and a very low level of estrogen just give more feminine features but not breasts? Or could I take a weaker dose of Sprio where I still have testosterone but the masculine features would be less pronounced? 

&amp;#x200B;

1.) Because if I had an androgynous look I'd still be accepted by family (versus having no support if I were to transition).

&amp;#x200B;

So here it goes.. I know I'm either Bigender {female and male at the same time, all the time} or ftm Transgender, but I don't know which.

&amp;#x200B;

I often feel like the Bigender thing is just an attempt at not transitioning because I'm scared to. I wished I had a penis rather than vagina for quite a long time now, always fantasize about being male, prefer he/him pronouns, and if I had a choice to choose between female and male I'd ALWAYS choose male with no exceptions.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I'm not masculine. I'm a **very** feminine person, I don't enjoy most if not ALL manly things. Pastels, fashion, cute things, rainbows, animals, flowers, nail polish, chokers, I love it all with a passion. I like having a feminine look to me, and my dream is to be a feminine male. I don't want, and never plan to, get surgery or take meds to alter my body. Hell, I don't even like makeup because of the idea of changing my appearance to one that isn't me just doesn't feel quite right. I appreciate the body and face I was born with, and don't want to alter them to the point where it's not even recognizable as me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I might be ftm Transgender, but I don't know. I don't have serious pains to be male, occasionally get some minor body dysphoria but by morning it's all normal. I don't hate my body or face, although I wish I had shorter and more man-like hair. I don't necessarily mind being called a she/her, but I don't prefer it or particularly enjoy it either.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any problems with my chest, as it's quite small and could easily be covered with baggy clothes if I did want to hide it, which I often don't care to. I also don't have a huge problem with my vagina, however I would much prefer to have a penis and the idea of intercourse with a vagina doesn't seem enjoyable to me. The main thing I hate is my long hair, I wish I could cut it into a gender-neutral if not more man-like hairstyle. I love my girly face but I wish I had a slightly, just slightly, more gender-neutral face.

&amp;#x200B;

When I imagine my future if I was a feminine male, I'm full of joy and the idea of it is **amazing** to me. I don't quite enjoy the idea of a future being female, though. I mean, I guess I could tolerate a future as a female, but it's NOT the preferred option in the slightest. I have a slight annoyance to females, even if they're doing nothing wrong, which I think might have something to do with my dislike to being female. I've always wished to have male friends, I don't know why but the idea of female friends seems kinda uninteresting to me and honestly kinda annoys me, once again might be linked to my dislike to being female. {Not trying to be sexist, just saying that for me my gender preference for friends would be male.}

I've always wished to have male friends, I don't know why but the idea of female friends seems kinda uninteresting to me and honestly kinda annoys me, once again might be linked to my dislike to being female. {Not trying to be sexist, just saying that for me my gender preference for friends would be male.}\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts? Advice?\n\nJust based on this, would you say I'm ftm Transgender or Bigender?

Hi! Female-bodied person here. I've felt this way about my gender all my life, but only recently have I realized how important this is to me.

I have no connection to my female body. I don't really care what body I have, because for me, expressing gender has is just a masculine/feminine thing.

* But since my body is female, it makes me feel like a fraud to present myself as male/use male pronouns. I feel like I *have* to tell people upfront, especially online, that my sex is female, because otherwise it feels like I would be lying to them; even though this isn't the case at all. I'm well aware that my sex isn't all that important in the grand scheme of things, but it just feels wrong to call myself/ask others to call me one thing when my body says another.

However, I prefer being seen as a male, both on and offline.
Masculine pronouns (He/Him), and being called ""cute"" or ""handsome"" give me euphoria. Since I do not experience much physical or social dysphoria, calling myself trans would feel wrong to me. I have no desire to change my sex/body/genitals, because I've just accepted that this is the body I was born in, and that's okay.

I've been identifying as bi man for over a year now, but I find that now the ""man"" part of that label is chafing me. Hear me out, and please forgive me if I ramble.

When I first came out as bi, I felt several senses of liberation, primarily that I no longer had to feel guilty for feeling attraction to men, but it also felt like a free pass to engage in gender nonconformity as a gay man. I didn't feel like I was locked into the strict ritual kf masculinity any longer. ""Who cares if ros√© moscato is gay, *I'm* gay."" I started pursuing drag with an interest that was previously reserved only for Halloween, and I adored the attention of being told what a beautiful woman I made. My partner (now ex) told me that I was possibly experiencing gender euphoria, but I brushed him off at the time.

What has had me ignoring these feelings for so long has been the fact that I really don't hate being a man. I started lifting weights a few years ago and I put on twenty pounds of muscle, and it's done wonders to my body image. I like being strong and muscular, and if I'm insecure about anything it's that I'm slightly short. My total lack of dysphoria while having dysphoric trans friends put me off of the idea of my own transness for a long time.

Where I start to dislike the idea of being a ""man"" is when I'm perceived and judged for being one. Criticisms leveled at men or maleness or masculinity make me feel a very strange sense of guilt and confusion. A lesbian on tumblr posts ""I hate men, don't look at me if you're a man,"" (who can blame her) and I feel at once that I'm being blamed for something I had no part in, but as well that I'm not actually the one being criticized. Now I don't mean this totally literally, I don't have *that* much of a persecution complex, but I wonder if this means something or if it's just conceit. The idea of ""*You* are a cis man so you *must* be like *this*"" makes me ask, ""Must I be a cis man?""

My total lack of dysphoria while having dysphoric trans friends put me off of the idea of my own transness for a long time.\n\nWhere I start to dislike the idea of being a ""man"" is when I\'m perceived and judged for being one. Criticisms leveled at men or maleness or masculinity make me feel a very strange sense of guilt and confusion. A lesbian on tumblr posts ""I hate men, don\'t look at me if you\'re a man,"" (who can blame her) and I feel at once that I\'m being blamed for something I had no part in, but as well that I\'m not actually the one being criticized. Now I don\'t mean this totally literally, I don\'t have *that* much of a persecution complex, but I wonder if this means something or if it\'s just conceit. The idea of ""*You* are a cis man so you *must* be like *this*"" makes me ask, ""Must I be a cis man?""\n\nHopefully this wasn\'t too nonsensical. I\'d love to hear any thoughts on what you this jumbled mess of confusion conveys.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Started seriously questioning... what the hell am I? ü§™', 'created': 1563283061.0}"

Anyway, here's my dilemma: 

A few months ago i started going out with this boy who i'd been friends with for a while, super sweet and very accepting of the fact that I usually lean towards liking girls. He's cis and straight and hasn't really had any experience with the lgbt community and has a pretty limited understanding of it all but despite this, he's never once shown any intolerance towards the community and seems pretty openminded about it. I love this guy, and he treats me with constant kindness and adoration and its something i dont wanna risk losing, but hearing him call me his girlfriend and say im a pretty girl really fucks me up because i know i should appreciate it but in the end it just makes me really uncomfortable. Ive always had short hair and acted very boyish and most people assume im a boy when first meeting me so ive never really felt a lot of pressure to act feminine until now because he loves seeing me dress a little feminine and i definitely act more 'girly' around him too. He says he's 100% straight, so im terrified that coming out to him will make him view me differently. I've told him there's something i need to tell him and that im worried he might not see me the same way and he says no matter what it is he'll love me the same but he always seems so happy to call me his gf and stuff like that so i'm worried that a) i'd be taking that away from him and b) he might not feel as comfortable being intimate with me or might see me differently if he knows i'm not a girl.

135,2019-07-18 04:26:20,cenqol,2,2,"So I'm 16, and for the past maybe 3 months or so, I've been seriously questioning my gender. This wasn't exactly a thing that came as a surprise to me when it started. The first time I ever heard about trans people existing was when I was 8 or so and saw an episode of American Dad where one character had transitioned to become a woman, and for some reason that I didn't understand the whole idea was something I gravitated towards (despite the actual depiction of the trans woman being a transphobic one, but I was an 8-year-old kid who didn't even know it was a possibility to not identity with your birth gender, so I didn't know that). But after watching that episode I ended up looking into it at that age, learning about it, and (although admittedly this only lasted a few days) I kinda was fixated on that idea, and even after that short period of time, every once in a while that intrigue popped up again.

Ultimately, I forgot about all of this until I started actively learning about the LGBT community, past the LG part. For a while, I never saw myself as part of that community (maybe this was because at the time I had barely hit puberty, if at all, and didn't know anything about myself). But around 8th grade I started to realize I might be bisexual, and I slowly over the course of a couple year came to the conclusion that I was, in fact, bi once I had my first crush on one of my best male friends. This ended up being not a fun crush, but that's neither here nor there. But still, even since then there have been times where I've been skeptical of myself and being bisexual (rn I'm once again, very certain I am, and at least with this I don't think I have anyway to telling myself I'm not anymore).

After realizing I was bisexual and for the most part coming to terms with that, I was watching a lot of anime. One thing that I noticed is that I always gravitated towards trans or crossdressing characters. At first, I thought it was just maybe a sexual thing, but slowly, overtime, I started to realize I was more able to connect with them than I had previously thought. I started thinking more about being a girl, what it would be like, and being happy at that thought. I started telling my closest friends what I was thinking about after a few weeks of it being something I got fixated on again. Then, about a week later, I painted my nails for the first time, loved it, and decided that I'd keep it on for when I went to school. I was met with almost no negative reactions. Everyone I talked to thought it was great (funnily enough, most of the girls I talked to said they were jealous because I somehow was able to paint them better than they could, which I find hard to believe but the amount of people that said it is hard to deny, but that is neither here nor there). The worst I ever got was a snicker about it, not to my face, and one kid asking if I was gonna spread the gay agenda if he signed my petition to be a candidate for my student Senate after he saw them. Then, in private, I started cross-dressing and it's been something I've certainly enjoyed doing since I started.

But I've still had my doubts ever since. Like I'd ask myself ""what if this is all just fabricated and fake?"" (Something which I incidentally ask myself about a lot of things I believe about myself). Then there's that I don't really feel any dysphoria either. The most I've felt was feeling weird not having nail polish on at a given moment, or when I'm cross-dressing and clock everything that makes me not look feminine. But this only happens when I'm not wearing clothes meant for men. If I'm wearing clothes like what I just normally would wear, I don't feel any dysphoria about my body whatsoever. I'm not necessarily not ok with being male, but I feel like there is also another part of me which is definitely more female.

So, lots of exposition, but now I can sorta get to the main point. I don't fully know all that much about being non-binary, or genderqueer, and it's hard to find good sources of information that aren't from anti-sjws, which is where it seems most get their info on the topics. I've been thinking that where I really belong is somewhere with a non-binary identity, but I want to know what other people think, based on what I've said, and also if there are any resources that are good to try to read more and understand better and hopefully be able to better understand myself.

If you read through this whole thing, I applaud you. I hope that someone might be able to help out with some resources. Maybe blogs, YouTube channels, YouTube videos that are really good.

I don\'t fully know all that much about being non-binary, or genderqueer, and it\'s hard to find good sources of information that aren\'t from anti-sjws, which is where it seems most get their info on the topics. I\'ve been thinking that where I really belong is somewhere with a non-binary identity, but I want to know what other people think, based on what I\'ve said, and also if there are any resources that are good to try to read more and understand better and hopefully be able to better understand myself.\n\nIf you read through this whole thing, I applaud you. I hope that someone might be able to help out with some resources. Maybe blogs, YouTube channels, YouTube videos that are really good. I want to be able to know where I belong.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Uncertain about gender', 'created': 1563449180.0}"

So I've always identified as a cis woman, and didn't question it because of how I was raised. 

It was always that women are women, you like pink, lace, and you're gonna grow up to immediately marry a man and give him children. (I'm pan + marriage/ child free so f*ck their views).

I was dressed up in girly things, I wasn't allowed to decide my own f*cking haircut until I was a pre teen, and was just treated like a doll.

As soon as I knew that's not the way it's meant to be, I skyrocketed and became my own person. I wear clothing from both departments, have short hair, and just refuse to give any fucks.

I started really questioning my gender identity not too long ago, and had a few phases throughout puberty where even being in a women's body felt kind of wrong. There are days where I want to be kind of feminine, and days where I'm feeling masculine.
I get that few people will take me seriously outside of this lovely sub, so I'm scared to say anything to anyone.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm AFAB and I tried T for a while,  and some of it was amazing like the deeper voice, musculature, the  thought that i'd one day have a ""male"" fat distribution pattern. Some  things I was ambivalent about like growing thicker peach fuzz that would  one day be full blown facial hair. Then some stuff i actually really  hated--smelling like a ""boy"", the idea of one day going bald, being seen  as a ""Man"" despite feeling really attached and formed by my experiences  as an AFAB person. I also got scared because i feel like i'm less  likely to experience physical violence if i'm a ""butch lesbian"" rather  than a feminine-presenting guy. I'm also really upset that i'll be very  short and small forever if i ever used T again. That height dysphoria  never lightened up. I get a lot of compliments for being so small and  slender as a woman, and that positivity wouldn't translate as well if i  were perceived to be male. I'm scared of having to tell my extended  family i'm trans because i'll be very obviously going through a male  puberty. Finding people to date is also easier as an AFAB person mostly  into dudes, though it's hurtful that i think most cis men i date only  humor me and don't actually see me as anything but a woman with a  testosterone-induced deeper voice.

The  conclusion i've reached lately is my life would have been 100000%  easier if I took testosterone before my ""girl"" puberty. But that didn't  happen. So here i am... just sort of paralyzed. There are some days  where I feel like I will literally die if i don't medically transition,  but most days it's a relatively more manageable anxiety/depression.  There are days where I can look at my body and feel bummed then days I  look at my body and can't sleep i'm so disturbed i don't look like a cis  guy. I took testosterone, but only for maybe 4 months. I still look  like a cis woman if i style myself feminine, though my voice is now deep  enough to turn some heads.

I'm  definitely going to get top surgery if i can ever afford it. So much  emotional pain is centered around my chest. Though there's also a lot of  pain around my feminine thighs. i want to die every time i remember  that if i don't transition, i'll age as a ""woman"" and that's the most  terrifying thing in the world to me. I'm terrified of being a middle  aged woman and having lost out on being a young man. i'm also scared of being a middle-aged woman simply because this world can be cruel to women viewed to be beyond their ""childbearing years"".

I've  been trying to ride somewhere in the middle this past year or two. I'm  not binding (it hurts my back) but dressing and styling myself as very  masculine. I'm not on testosterone anymore, but it's left my voice very  androgynous/learning a bit masc of center. I sort of knew this  beforehand but didn't understand til i starting living it--*people can sometimes get really angry/upset if they can't tell if you're a boy or a girl*.  People treat me worse now that i'm not a cis-het passing AFAB person.  Sometimes I get asked on the street if i'm a man or a woman.

I've been thinking about going on testosterone for a little over a year now. I still love my name (Pearl) and my she/her pronouns (I still don't mind being called a woman, despite considering myself non-binary/genderqueer). Despite that, I just don't relate to my physical body, and after a lot of research, I think I would love the changes that testosterone could bring. I'm super excited by the idea of bottom growth, a bit of a name drop, and some facial hair-- and potentially top surgery in the future. 

I know I'd probably start getting gendered as a man more frequently (since I really don't identify with being a man), which wouldn't be ideal for me personally, but I feel like the stronger connection to my body would be worth it.

I'm super excited by the idea of bottom growth, a bit of a name drop, and some facial hair-- and potentially top surgery in the future. \n\nI know I'd probably start getting gendered as a man more frequently (since I really don't identify with being a man), which wouldn't be ideal for me personally, but I feel like the stronger connection to my body would be worth it. \n\nI guess I'm just wondering if anyone else here feels the same, mostly for self validation's sake haha, but also on tips for explaining your identity to others.\n\nThanks a ton! :)"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Thinking about testosterone, but I still like going by she/her pronouns', 'created': 1563946150.0}"

188,2019-07-24 19:23:38,chcopp,7,5,"I  haven't been putting much thought into this until a few weeks ago when I started going on Tumblr, but I've been thinking about it a lot lately.

I don't know if I'm a cis-female who's simply a tomboy, or genderflux.

I mean, ever since I was little, I was always a bit of a tomboy. I never liked makeup or dresses or anything like that. I never had dolls or wanted to be a princess or anything like that. I also liked being called a tomboy and identified myself as one.

But¬†as of late, sometimes I feel 100% female but other times I feel mostly female, or at least I think I do. I use she/her pronouns, I like to label myself as a female, I also often call myself a woman,¬†but there are some days where I feel like a demigirl?

Before I discovered genderflux, I entertained the idea of being a genderfluid demigirl, as in I switch between being a female and a demigirl. The thing is though is that sometimes¬†it felt right, but other times not quite?

Sometimes it feels foreign to label myself as genderflux/genderfluid/demigirl, but other times (or even at the same time) I feel okay towards it? Or even natural?

2 days ago when I discovered genderflux , it was a mix of ""that's what I'm feeling? that's my possible identity?!"" and¬†feeling really¬†intimidated by it. Like, I felt stressed about it.¬†It made sense but it also feels kind of scary? I'd even say it felt¬†wrong?

So I don't know if that means I'm cis, or if it's just me being afraid of the idea of being nonbinary and being in that minority.

It feels intimidating for me, to be completely honest. Like, I feel like it would be weird to identify as such or something. Like I would stick out like a sore thumb amongst others.

And I'll be honest, sometimes I feel intimidated by this because the people I look up to and admire (my favorite YouTubers, artists, etc) are cis as far as I know and for some reason the idea of being something else scares me?

I mean I'm already asexual so I'm apart of LGBT I think, so I guess it wouldn't make much of a difference.

I wanna say that I should wait and give it time and not worry about it and eventually I'll realize my identity.

But I'm really impatient.

I also had a few moments of me feeling like a guy, I think, so maybe it's genderfluid?

The thing is with being afab is that I don't know if I disagree with being a female, or disagree with the stereotype of being a female. I¬†*hate*¬†the word gender roles with a passion because I feel like it's telling me I'm expected to be the ancient world view of what a woman should be. You know, being submissive to men, taking care of the household, never going outside, having kids, being a mother...the idea of it makes me want to vomit my guts out.

And the thing is also is that I don't believe that all feminine men are nonbinary or gay, or all tomboys are nonbinary.¬†

And honestly, I'm really really¬†worried that I want to be nonbinary just¬†to get¬†attention and support or something.

It's also worth noting that I have OCD so maybe these are just symptoms of it?

I am a heteroromantic greysexual (probably), biological woman. Living happily with my boyfriend. Sounds perfect, right? But I always feel disgusted about myself and about the way I feel.
 For the most of my life I thought I was asexual because I couldn't feel anything towards heterosexual guys. The fact that they are into women, sexually, disgusts me (I don't hate women, I support feminists, I support all the LGBTQ people, but I just feel this way). That's probably why I fee quitel comfortable with my man cause it was the first relationship for both of us. 
The problem is that when I actually feel something (I'm not into sex, so what do people call it? a desire?), it's towards gays. Though I would NEVER try to do anything to, like, seduce a gay (which is stupid), cause I respect their sexuality. That will always stay in my head.

230,2019-07-29 23:06:09,cjizzd,9,19,"Hi. So, here‚Äôs the backstory: I came out as bi/pan to some friends in 2010, to my family in 2014, and in 2015, after dating a trans/nonbinary person, I identified publicly as gender nonconforming. This came after discussing gender with them, and really connecting with their story. I‚Äôve never felt any specific attachment to my ‚Äúmaleness‚Äù as the standard identifiers just don‚Äôt resonate with me. Often, the things people identify as ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù are closer to my heart. I grew up being told the things I liked were too girly or exclusively feminine (singing, drawing, poetry, stuffed animals, expressing emotions in a healthy way). I had to force myself to care about football. 

I also always loathed gender norms, and I‚Äôve always believed there‚Äôs just way too much fluidity for there to be a binary. 

Anyhoo, I refer to myself as male quite often, unless I‚Äôm specfically given the option of choosing ‚Äúgender nonconforming.‚Äù And as for pronouns, I often default to he/him/his even though I frankly prefer they/them/their. It‚Äôs been a long battle complicated by intense body dysphoria, depression, living in a very red state, etc. I have put off really thinking about it over the last few years because I hate my physical appearance and feel like I can‚Äôt be happy/content while living in this shitty dumpster fire of a body. So really wrestling with my gender expression/identity has been an afterthought until recently. 

My issue is I feel like a fraud. I feel like I should just own one lane or the other. It feels like I‚Äôm taking up space from people who actually belong. I now find myself feeling like I can‚Äôt be happy(ier?) until I sort this out. Hence...

Thoughts?

I‚Äôve never felt any specific attachment to my ‚Äúmaleness‚Äù as the standard identifiers just don‚Äôt resonate with me. Often, the things people identify as ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù are closer to my heart. I grew up being told the things I liked were too girly or exclusively feminine (singing, drawing, poetry, stuffed animals, expressing emotions in a healthy way). I had to force myself to care about football. \n\nI also always loathed gender norms, and I‚Äôve always believed there‚Äôs just way too much fluidity for there to be a binary. \n\nAnyhoo, I refer to myself as male quite often, unless I‚Äôm specfically given the option of choosing ‚Äúgender nonconforming.‚Äù And as for pronouns, I often default to he/him/his even though I frankly prefer they/them/their. It‚Äôs been a long battle complicated by intense body dysphoria, depression, living in a very red state, etc. I have put off really thinking about it over the last few years because I hate my physical appearance and feel like I can‚Äôt be happy/content while living in this shitty dumpster fire of a body. So really wrestling with my gender expression/identity has been an afterthought until recently. \n\nMy issue is I feel like a fraud. I feel like I should just own one lane or the other. It feels like I‚Äôm taking up space from people who actually belong. I now find myself feeling like I can‚Äôt be happy(ier?) until I sort this out. Hence...\n\nThoughts?\n\n(Be gentle, please.)', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Totally lost, need guidance', 'created': 1564466769.0}"

245,2019-07-31 21:59:08,ckf4t5,25,30,"Okay, hey, I'm gonna try to keep this as brief as possible, since last time I typed out a few paragraphs of details, my phone somehow wiped it all out.

As suggested by the title, I'm struggling over labels for a few reasons, and I'd really appreciate any sort of thoughts you peeps could give on the matter.

To start with, I'm AFAB, and I've been identifying as nonbinary for a few months now (and have managed to come out to two of my close friends). I only managed to settle on that cause I can distinctly recognize I'm not cis, but I don't really know where to take it from there, and I'm not sure if I'm entirely a transman either.

I experience dysphoria when someone refers to me with feminine terms (girl, lady, princess, etc), and it feels awful, really. And, when I'm mistaken as a guy, it usually makes me happier and smile. 

That part is fairly clear cut, but when it comes to my body, what dysphoria I have is a bit weird. My body is naturally very masculine for a female, so that bit doesn't particularly bother me. I like binding and hiding my chest, since it makes me feel better with being seen as a guy, but I don't mind my chest itself, since my mind registers it as just a body part or something. With regards to bottom dysphoria, it's bad some days where I wish I had male genitalia, but other days it doesn't bother me at all.

So all that is fine and dandy, I guess, and that makes me lean towards being a binary transman, but it's not that simple, since I don't feel comfortable thinking of myself in that manner either. I don't feel completely man. It's rather iffy, and really, sometimes I just feel nothing when it comes to gender. At least, I think that's the feeling, since I'm really bad at recognizing my own thoughts and emotions. 

I think it's also important to mention that my feelings about identity don't stem from hanging out with guys, or being fairly rough as a kid. I dress masculine frequently, but at the same time I can dress very feminine, so I wouldn't really say that influences my identity... (Except for that I feel better dressing feminine when I think of myself as more of a boy, and that I'll sometimes dress masculine to ""fit in with the guys"")

I swear my questioning period has been dragged on for years, sigh. I'm very sorry that I ramble a lot, and if you've managed to read through all that, I'd appreciate any advice you could offer. I'm also sorry that my thoughts get really messy, and that I'm typing all this out at 1 am while on vacation.

I've hopped around the terms demiboy, agender, bigender and obviously, nonbinary, but I haven't been able to get anyone else's opinion on this issue. I feel like a part of that is due to me being worried about being seen as silly or something for questioning this... (Almost all my irl friends say a lot of  homophobic/transphobic things.)

246,2019-07-31 22:02:44,ckf6fi,0,1,"I‚Äôm not sure how to navigate my love life and would really appreciate some help. Forgive this being a little scattered, as I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to explain as I write. Also forgive it being pretty complex and forgive how much of this feels like something for r/polyamory. I think it‚Äôs a genderqueer issue at its core. It‚Äôs also really hard for me to expose such intimate details about myself to strangers like this, so um‚Ä¶ please be careful with that.

I‚Äôm genderqueer. The ‚Äúwoman trapped in a man‚Äôs body‚Äù cliche is not inaccurate, but my body is a man‚Äôs body and there‚Äôs nothing to be done about that. I have a very masculine build, I‚Äôm bald, bearded and hate the way I look clean shaven. In ways, that‚Äôs hard for me, to not be ‚Äúpretty‚Äù. Cross-dressing is kind of fun, I like how my legs look in tights, but it still just feels like playing dress-up really, besides I look like a hulk in a dress.  Reassignment is just not an option for me, and I wouldn‚Äôt want to undergo reassignment, I don‚Äôt have genital dysphoria or anything. I‚Äôm actually coming to terms with my body. I‚Äôve learned to like the idea that the role reversal I experience in the bedroom, the divide between the fact of my body, and my natural purpose as a sexual being is extreme. If that makes sense. But my authentic self is submissive, needs to be penetrated, would just die of joy if once in my lifetime a cute tomboi bought me a drink while I was sitting alone at the bar hoping someone would notice me. I understand that a lot of the dichotomies that feed my identity are false ones. It is not so simple as ""men are the aggressor and women are pretty"". But I think many of these stereotypes are very largely the case. And while these aren't rules, they inform what I identify about myself that I consider feminine, and I like that these things feel feminine to me. I guess this is all to say, I know I'm generalizing, I know which elements of this are potentially problematic, but please trust the parts of this I seem clear on are considered.

I‚Äôm 32, attracted to women and curious about men. I‚Äôve been non-monogamous for three years, realizing the depth of my genderqueer identity about as long, and I've been committed to a wonderful female partner for nine months. Being non-monogamous has been a healthy choice overall for me. I was really hopeful about the possibilities of having a securely non-monogamous partner. We‚Äôve both wanted sex with multiple partners. We both want to open our relationship to others. But despite being on the same page, it hasn‚Äôt been going well because of the complications of my gender identity. But then, nothing ever has.

I think I‚Äôve gotten as far as I have romantically by behaving like a guy, even when it's been counterintuitive. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôll never get what I really need this way, but I just can't picture me getting what I need anyhow at this point. I don't think I'm bad looking as a male, but I just can‚Äôt imagine how I ever would have connected with anyone romantically if I hadn‚Äôt repeatedly made choices like messaging first countless times in online dating, talking to someone first at the bar, being sexually aggressive in the way that makes a woman feel desired. I sense I need to change certain things, like maybe explain all this up front in dating profiles? But idk. It's hard to summarize, for one thing. And I'm really private about my personal life, owing largely to having been victimized by a stalker during formative years. I'm like 90% sure when I told a friend about this, she outed me and word got to my family, which is mortifying. Putting this vulnerable side of myself at the forefront of my public-facing social identity is scary for me. Even writing this is scary. If I had to attach my picture and my real name to it?

Anyway, my partner and I got as far as we have because I was capable of being a more dynamic person for her. She was interested, for example, in exploring submission, and I have a lot of experience being sexually dominant because this is what satisfies many women and I want my partners to be happy. But we‚Äôve both learned through the course of our relationship that we‚Äôre not a perfect fit for each other. She‚Äôs bisexual, but seeing me in a bra and panties was unattractive to her. She‚Äôll penetrate me when it‚Äôs becoming a problem how neglected this fundamental aspect of my self is. And I have to admit to an amount of resentment I feel, at least envy, because I‚Äôve so frequently felt like I have to do things that don‚Äôt feel natural to me, while her needs get met because she's a pretty woman, and thus desired. But in theory, this should all be workable, because this is the whole point of non-monogamy, that you can have several partners if one can‚Äôt fulfill your various needs. I had wished that she could fulfill more of what I needed. But so it goes.

We've only had one sexual experience with another couple, call him J and her D. We hesitated to act on the possibility with them because I had expressed my unease over the fact that D is very submissive, which again, it doesn‚Äôt feel natural to me to be the sexual aggressor. It was clear she wouldn't, for instance, text me first, or much at all. I felt like it could be okay in the end, so we tried it, and it was overall a really positive experience in and of itself. Over the following months I expressed my discomfort over my partner and J texting fairly frequetly. It wasn‚Äôt jealousy. My concern was that D and I weren‚Äôt really clicking and it didn‚Äôt seem to me like it was important to her whether I was fulfilled in the arrangement. I was uneasy about needing to be the aggressor to keep this thing she's enjoying running smoothly for her. Her reaction to me bringing this up was negative in a way I‚Äôve never seen her which was awful for me. I understand it‚Äôs frustrating. It isn‚Äôt as though she can help that women don‚Äôt behave around me the way I wish they would. Still, I‚Äôm carrying some major anxiety as we move forward because I feel like a liability.

And again, this is pretty specific to non-monogamy, but the vast majority of mfmf cases are ones where the women are the only ones who get paid attention. Of course, there‚Äôs an abundance of guys who are interested in a threesome, which I‚Äôm not even disinterested in, but the issue is that to this other guy I‚Äôm almost definitely incidental, not as relevant as my female partner. She‚Äôs wanted to start looking for people again, and I do too, but I‚Äôm growing skeptical about my chance of ever finding the kind of partner I know I need. I know I‚Äôve never had what would really satisfy me, and I know that I‚Äôve been looking really REALLY hard (by anyone‚Äôs standards) and for a very long time. She‚Äôs volunteered to take the lead with looking for others this time, which is really strong of her, and obviously it's going very smoothly. And so I get screenshots of guys she‚Äôs attracted to. ‚ÄúHe seems really great, he has a female partner who he doms, he says they‚Äôd be open to meeting with us.‚Äù Which, it‚Äôs hard to feel negative about, but it all feels kind of abstract. So there‚Äôs a guy who wants to have sex with her. That doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me because he doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me. It means even less that there‚Äôs some woman who may or may not theoretically be interested, that neither of us has seen. My partner is doing a great job of providing the security we lost when she reacted negatively before. But this has all brought my need for attention to the forefront. It highlights how irrelevant I already felt.

So now what? I feel like I‚Äôve finally gotten to a point where I know what I need. And it‚Äôs a relationship with a woman where I‚Äôm the one who fulfills the traditional roles of a woman. If I‚Äôm dynamic, if I make things happen for myself because ostensibly this is the only way they will, that is, if I play the traditional gender role of a guy, it‚Äôll eventually get to a point like the one I find myself in now, where I‚Äôm frustrated my needs aren‚Äôt being met. But even setting aside where my current relationship is at, I would be just plain lost already as to how to attract someone who makes me feel like a woman.

As a very masculine bodied genderqueer woman, I feel so out of place, even among the atypical gender identities of this group. How do I find people that want me? I don‚Äôt even know that they exist, but at best I know they‚Äôre so exceedingly rare I can never count on one approaching me even when I‚Äôm in my cutest outfit looking my most approachable. I feel like the only real avenue for this is fetlife, where I can (this feels so gross to even say) ""advertise"" myself as a submissive, but I have done that, am doing that. It doesn‚Äôt get you attention. Making this a ""fetish"" thing feels like burying the lede. It's like, do you know how hard it is to find pornography where a male bodied person is sissified and penetrated in a way that feels respectful? Practically impossible. Tinder is the site everyone uses, and it's not designed for providing meaningful context.

I want to blame this stupid body. Despite everything I said earlier about feeling okay about it, being okay that it's a man's body, I see it as a huge obstacle and I can‚Äôt tell you how much I hate it and wish I had been born the right gender. Because I feel undesireable. This feels like a vehicle for a person I'm not. Crazy that this feels like a total afterthought, but I have pretty considerable issues with my weight, too, because I don‚Äôt feel desired no matter what I do, so what does it even matter what I look like?

TL:DR; I look overwhelmingly like a manly man and feel overwhelmingly like a girlie girl. How can I attract the strong woman I need? And hopefully fast, because I really need to move forward?

I was born male and identified that way until very recently, but the development was a while coming.  I'd done a couple of sex games with my first wife that involved me wearing her panties in public as a turn on; we both thought it'd be funny and hot to ""get away with it"", and it helped that we were the same size, but I felt really good in them... not aroused as such, but it found a place in me that I didn't know needed touched.  After doing that with her a couple of times, I thought about asking to do it again (didn't even occur to me to just take a pair of her panties and wear them anyway) but the marriage was disintegrating and it didn't happen.

Fast forward to five years ago.  I was driving home from being out with friends and I had this urge to go right then and get some panties.  So I did.  I outed myself a few weeks later to my (second) wife, who didn't care for the idea of her husband in lingerie.  (I think there's a difference between general underwear and lingerie; she doesn't.)  So I hid it from her.  I didn't tell her that I'd added bras.  Or that a couple of years after that I'd started painting my toenails, shaving my legs nine months of the year, and wearing pantyhose.  (We lived in Trumplandia.  The general populace wouldn't have taken to a man with shaved legs, so I didn't do it in summer until this year.  Same with the toenails.)

It didn't go any further until six weeks ago, and I started wondering, ""What if you tried wearing a blouse?""  Did the math on my size, went to Walmart to try something on to verify it.  I had my son with me (he's six and autistic, so... nonjudgmental).  I took him and a couple of sizes of the same blouse, short sleeves with ruffles on the sleeves, and tried one.  He looked at me and said, ""You're beautiful!""  He was right.

I ordered a skirt... a few more blouses... a dress... three pairs of shoes.  I bought a curling wand (my hair is long enough that I can do that).

I added makeup, and a few weeks later presented as female for the first time to my therapist.  I felt like I'd found myself at last.  When I was twice called Miss last Wednesday I was giddy.

I feel beautiful, worthy, and desirable for the first time in my life... and very much alone.  My wife doesn't know, and I don't know how to tell her.

Non-binary/Genderfluid, I finally have a word for how I feel, for years I've been confused by the fact that I really like 3 piece suits and cocktail dresses; for a long time I thought I might be gay but then I met my wife and I discovered that wasn't the case, then I thought maybe I like cross dressing but it didn't feel like enough to just put the clothes on I wanted to look like the woman underneath.    



Thank god for the Reddit, a random post about another AMAB who had the same experience as me was like a lightbulb going off in my head, a terrifying lightbulb that could potentially improve or ruin my life. I spend most of the rest of the day reading into non-binary and other people experiences.    





\*\*Day 2: Sunday\*\*    



Anxiety, so much anxiety, between emails from work that I have to deal with on Monday and not having any clue how to tell my wife I ended up walking the dog repeatedly way more than normal until my wife actually questioned why I was going for yet another walk (on a side note it was the dog's best ever weekend).    



I spent most of the day in what felt like an outer body experience simultaneously excited and terrified. On my final walk of the day I ended up breaking down to my friend and telling her everything, I need someone neutral who I knew cared about me but also wouldn't ruin my life if they rejected me. Fortunately, she was amazing and was super excited for me and gave me loads of tips on coming out to my wife.    





\*\*Day 3: Monday\*\*    



Work was hell but too be honest I barely noticed anything other than the clock slowly ticking by, I'd resolved to tell my wife that evening because I didn't want to hide anything from her.    



Finally, I reached zero hour, the kids were asleep, I got my wife a glass of wine and started the conversation ""there's something we need to talk about, it's nothing anyone's done wrong, but I have to address it..."" I spoke nearly continuously for about thirty minutes and poured my heart about how I felt, how I'd felt this way for a long time but never had any words to be able to articulate the feelings and that I didn't even know there was a term for how I felt until Saturday.    



I stopped talking took a breath and asked her how she felt about it, she was incredibly supportive for somebody who's just had an anvil of information dropped on them, I gave her the option to leave, I told her that although I needed to find out who I was inside I would only do it with her and if she was uncomfortable I'd rather be miserable with her than totally devastated without her. My wife told me to stop being stupid, she had no intention of leaving me and although it was a shock she understood as best she could and would do whatever she needed to help me.    



The rest of the evening is kind of a blur, I gave my wife a bit of space and took the dog for a longer walk so she could have some time to process everything, when I got back we just sat, ate chinese takeaway and cracked a few jokes at the predicament, it was the best outcome I could have hoped for.    





\*\*Day 4 &amp; 5: Tuesday/Wednesday\*\*    



I'm lumping these two days together since they were basically the same, huge surges of euphoria followed by periods of anxiety. I had resolved to take things reasonably slow so my wife wouldn't be uncomfortable but I did push the boundaries on Wednesday evening by looking at dresses with her just to see how she would react (my concern was she was still in a state of denial), she was super excited about the idea of going cloth shopping together which was a positive boost for the evening.    



\*\*Day 6: Thursday\*\*    



Utter crippling anxiety, I dressed in pretty much a full suit today and hid within my male half's comfort zone feeling like an imposter and wondering if I'd done the right thing saying anything to my wife. There were points where I felt completely disconnected from the genderfluid feeling I'd felt over the last five days and I began to psyche myself out thinking that made it was all hormones or a fever. I got home from work and basically crashed for an hour before comfort eating but by the end of the evening I'd started to feel like a human again.    



\*\*Day 7: Friday\*\*    



Started the day feeling anxious which I believe was a holdover from Thursday but as the day went on I began to feel more confident in my previous assertions. Spent the evening looking at clothes and bits with my wife and purchased two dresses to arrive the following week, there's not a lot to say about Friday other than buying the clothes didn't feel wrong it felt like an extension of my inner person that I'd been trying to keep hidden away.    





N.B. I'm writing all this down because it's therapeutic for me to get the feelings out in words especially so I can re-read them later when I'm feeling low and remind myself of how I felt before, but I also hope it might encourage or support anyone else who's going through the same feelings of confusion, excitement and anxiety that I'm going through.

I spend most of the rest of the day reading into non-binary and other people experiences.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 2: Sunday\\*\\*    \n\n\n\nAnxiety, so much anxiety, between emails from work that I have to deal with on Monday and not having any clue how to tell my wife I ended up walking the dog repeatedly way more than normal until my wife actually questioned why I was going for yet another walk (on a side note it was the dog\'s best ever weekend).    \n\n\n\nI spent most of the day in what felt like an outer body experience simultaneously excited and terrified. On my final walk of the day I ended up breaking down to my friend and telling her everything, I need someone neutral who I knew cared about me but also wouldn\'t ruin my life if they rejected me. Fortunately, she was amazing and was super excited for me and gave me loads of tips on coming out to my wife.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Day 3: Monday\\*\\*    \n\n\n\nWork was hell but too be honest I barely noticed anything other than the clock slowly ticking by, I\'d resolved to tell my wife that evening because I didn\'t want to hide anything from her.    \n\n\n\nFinally, I reached zero hour, the kids were asleep, I got my wife a glass of wine and started the conversation ""there\'s something we need to talk about, it\'s nothing anyone\'s done wrong, but I have to address it..."" I spoke nearly continuously for about thirty minutes and poured my heart about how I felt, how I\'d felt this way for a long time but never had any words to be able to articulate the feelings and that I didn\'t even know there was a term for how I felt until Saturday.    \n\n\n\nI stopped talking took a breath and asked her how she felt about it, she was incredibly supportive for somebody who\'s just had an anvil of information dropped on them, I gave her the option to leave, I told her that although I needed to find out who I was inside I would only do it with her and if she was uncomfortable I\'d rather be miserable with her than totally devastated without her.

I've always considered myself a (mostly) straight cis woman. Sure I was a tomboy growing up and I'm still not ""girly"" but I've never been uncomfortable with being a woman. Even when I was 12 and dressed like a boy I corrected people who thought I was one, even though I actually liked the fact that I was androgynous enough for them to make the mistake.

I wear women‚Äôs jeans with men‚Äôs sneakers, men‚Äôs shirts with pushup bras. I never really thought about it beyond ‚Äúmen‚Äôs t-shirts and shoes are cooler‚Äù and it's never mattered. As an adult I don‚Äôt have a figure that anyone is likely to mistake for male anyway, regardless of how I dress.

My first D&amp;D character was male. No one else at the table was openly playing outside of their own gender so I figured I‚Äôd try something different. I make a lot of characters (many of which I‚Äôll never get to play) about evenly split male and female. I do the same thing in video games, trying to keep a balance of male and female characters.

And then I made a changeling for D&amp;D. Changelings can change their appearance at will and have a pretty fluid relationship with gender so I debated the use of pronouns for the character and eventually decided that he‚Äôd mostly use ‚Äúhe‚Äù since he usually chooses to appear as a male (albeit androgynous) elf. That‚Äôs whatever, it hasn‚Äôt even come up in character because even though people know he‚Äôs not a normal elf they don‚Äôt know what he is.

But between that and people asking why I tend to make male characters it got me thinking. Every since I was a kid playing make believe, slipping in and out of male personas has always felt natural and it never occurred to me until recently that maybe it isn't natural or expected for everyone.

I have non-binary friends, people who use ‚Äúthey‚Äù pronouns because neither male or female feels right. But that‚Äôs not me: female is just fine. Hell, I mostly even like being a woman and I've never experienced dysphoria. It‚Äôs just that I'm realizing I think being male would also be fine.

I looked it up and discovered that non-binary includes genderfluid and that genderfluid can include being both male and female, rather than neither. So now I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm reading too much into this. I don‚Äôt know if the fact that pride month just ended and that my friend recently came out as non-binary is influencing this line of thought. And I don‚Äôt know if even it matters. Even if I settle on the idea of being genderfluid it doesn‚Äôt change anything. I‚Äôm not looking to change my name or pronouns or the way I present.

I know my husband wouldn‚Äôt reject me or anything, but I‚Äôm still hesitant to talk to him. What if this is nothing and I‚Äôm letting outside factors color my thinking? If I say it I can‚Äôt take it back so it feels like such a permanent decision, especially for someone like me who doesn‚Äôt really do feelings.

I think a bit of back story is needed first before I go into my coming out. I stream on Twitch (like a tonne of other people these days) and up until recently I was the owner of a mighty beard. I would frequently get compliments on it from viewers. I know having a beard isn't a symbol of masculinity but to me it symbolised one, so I trimmed it back and then yesterday shaved it off completely.

Some context. I'm 21 and asexual. I'm happy with that part of me, but gender has always been... Weird. I remember dressing up in my Mum's clothes when I was a small child, then stopping for a while, then doing it secretly again right at the end of high school. I've also always toyed with the idea of being a girl. In video games I often play female characters, I've always gotten on better with female friends, I've often dreamed about being female (as in actual sleeping dreams). Many of my female friends have even told me that I've never seemed ""male"" to them, I'm just * my name *. 

Recently I've felt a serious urge to wear bras again. I've always liked the way they feel, sort of reassuring in a way. I love looking at dresses and wearing leggings. I've been talking with a friend of mine about this and I've established that some days I feel like wearing dresses and some days I feel like wearing chainmail. Some days I wake up feeling dressy and as the day goes on I feel more chainmail and vice versa.

I've also started to deal with some serious dysphoria over my genitalia. I don't like it, I don't like that it's there, I don't like that it does the things it does.

125,2019-07-15 20:17:27,cdmu75,3,5,"I always felt like a cis guy for so many years, even now to some extant. I grew up in a predominately white cishet community, and there were certain expectations for gender roles and how boys and girls were supposed to behave. I never really had any opportunities to explore non-masc identity, but most of the time I didn‚Äôt care because I enjoyed being a guy.


However, ever since spending more time with my partner and experiences I had on psychedelics, I‚Äôve become more questioning towards my gender. Basically, on shrooms and DMT I felt very femme, dressed in femme clothes, behaved femme, and a lot of it came naturally or at least felt unforced, to the point that I‚Äôd forget to switch out of my fish voice while on the phone with my original high school friends; I didn‚Äôt feel any attachment to my old self, and got to explore being new people and identities. I also noticed trends in my behavior, like my comfort and preference to having female friends instead of males in college, as well as wearing some of my moms clothes as a child, watching a lot of girl-centered tv shows as a kid, etc. Of course this can also mean absolutely nothing, but I could tell that I was less masc as I am now when I was a child. 

Since then though, I feel like I‚Äôve become more distant towards my femme side. I love the thought of being femme, doing cute makeup, wearing femme clothes, and have even pleasantly imagined being a mother, but sometimes I try to think and feel more femme and it feels exhausting and stressful rather than natural. Like I want to be more femme and get more in touch with that part of myself, but my mind and body feels masc. There are times where if I‚Äôm in the shower and concentrate hard enough, I see my body differently, and it helps me feel much more femme and in touch with my femme side. However, it makes me anxious that I‚Äôm merely pretending to be gender fluid or femme for the sake of validating this identity I claim to have, to both make me happy and to also make my partner happy (they had reservations about seeing a cishet guy originally, now after I‚Äôve explored myself more and spent more time with them, they are much less anxious) even though at this point they wouldn‚Äôt care what gender I am. 

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm forcing this, or perhaps I‚Äôm making it more difficult by setting expectations and comparing my identity to other NB/GF people, trying to think and behave how I‚Äôd have expected to originally as an outsider to the queer community. I have a lot of anxiety regarding my gender, as well as how my family would feel if I came out (they already have expressed dissatisfaction with the fact I‚Äôm seeing a trans guy). 

If I had to describe how I feel, I‚Äôd say like a shattered mirror, with different pieces arranged in the wrong and confusing places, making it difficult to understand what I am.

Forgive   me for thinking outside the box on this one, but I personally want to   be transgendered.  I think some of the most beautiful people on this   earth are individuals who are a mixture of both genders.  In a weird way   I think it is the best of both worlds or having all the toys.   Is  that  greedy of me?  I mean my sexuality is towards women.  I think  women are  absolutely art in motion.  I could also find myself attracted  to  another mtf transgender, but I find guys a bit repulsive and hairy.

So   yea, I think girls with a penis are hot.  I want to be one of them.    I'm also not offended or put off by terms like transsexual, or trans, or   tranny, new half, two spirit, or whatever else anyone wants to label   me.  I see alot of trans girls in different sections of reddit that post   pics of themselves in transition, so obviously they are happy with  what  they have.   Is that a bad thing?  I know it's different for  everyone,  but my dysphoria is not around my genitals and to be  perfectly honest, I  love vagina, but genitals male or female, really  neither one are all  that attractive when you get down to it, they look a  little alien or  messed up either way.  So I'm not really concerned at  all with what  hangs down below or doesn't.  My main focus has always  been on outward  appearance, body curves, breasts, hips, thighs, eyes,  those are the  things that make a beautiful woman.  People might wear  pussy hats now  days but I've never really wanted to just sit around and  stair at one.

Is  it wrong to  want and desire to be trans?  I mean if I could wave a  magic wand yea, I  would prefer to be female, but I've seen what they do,  and I am less  than impressed, and don't wish to have the maintenance of  a man made  vagina.  Dilation, surgeries, pain, upkeep, no thank you.

I still identify as female on the inside, but I think transgender girls are female, just with a little something extra, a bonus!

I  still want to pass when I'm done transitioning, but I'm not  uncomfortable with always having a little something special or extra  down below either.  I actually enjoy my sexuality and enjoy using what I  have.  I've always been one to accept my circumstances and try to deal  with them and have realistic expectations for the outcome.  so....

am I the crazy one for enjoying being trans?

159,2019-07-20 04:05:37,cfhk2c,10,45,"For all but a few minutes of the last three days, my feminine side was dominating.  (AMAB, save you the wondering.)  ""Dominating"" understates it; I was a woman.

Wednesday found me out in the world as my feminine side for eight hours.  I dropped my son off at his therapy... I've already outed myself there, but they hadn't yet seen me present as fully female.  Actually, apart from my therapist, no one that knows me had seen me present as fully female in person.  So that was terrifying... and uneventful.  I took him in, handed him off, and left, just like every other day.

From there, I found a quiet place on the campus I teach at and worked.  God bless telecommuting.  I was supposed to have therapy, but when you therapist gets last minute jury duty, the schedule goes astray.  I promised the wife take-away for dinner but they didn't open until 4, so I repaired to a bagel shop, where they treated me fine as a good place of business would, and then to Starbucks where the barista botched my name.  (I answer to a different name when I present female.)  But those were the first times I'd gone into a place of business presenting that way and it went fine.  I had to change before I got home (still haven't told the wife, tabled for the time being), but I was so excited, exhilarated, happy that the clothes didn't matter.  I was a woman.

Thursday was the same.  Worked at home in some non-descript clothes (tee-shirt and yoga pants, gotta love it), then a meeting at my son's therapy, then my own rescheduled therapy... blouse and shorts and ballet flats while I was out.  Didn't feel like messing with makeup two days running but then a lot of women don't.

Today I was still identifying female and kind of freaking a little; it's never lasted so long in one stretch before.  I wanted to throw something different on at home but couldn't... that frustrated me too.  There was something at the zoo tonight for special needs children and their immediate families, so I took my son.  Transferred into a blouse that was... more translucent than I thought it was, but that was secondary to the sweat; 90 degrees in the shade, perspiration will happen.  But my son... he doesn't see the clothes or the gender identity, he sees the person.  He sees Daddy.  And while I'm sure I got some second looks and some stares, the longer I was in the world, the less I cared.

And then, on the drive home, the woman in me put her head on my shoulder and slept.

(AMAB, save you the wondering.)  ""Dominating"" understates it; I was a woman.\n\nWednesday found me out in the world as my feminine side for eight hours.  I dropped my son off at his therapy... I\'ve already outed myself there, but they hadn\'t yet seen me present as fully female.  Actually, apart from my therapist, no one that knows me had seen me present as fully female in person.  So that was terrifying... and uneventful.  I took him in, handed him off, and left, just like every other day.\n\nFrom there, I found a quiet place on the campus I teach at and worked.  God bless telecommuting.  I was supposed to have therapy, but when you therapist gets last minute jury duty, the schedule goes astray.  I promised the wife take-away for dinner but they didn\'t open until 4, so I repaired to a bagel shop, where they treated me fine as a good place of business would, and then to Starbucks where the barista botched my name.  (I answer to a different name when I present female.)  But those were the first times I\'d gone into a place of business presenting that way and it went fine.  I had to change before I got home (still haven\'t told the wife, tabled for the time being), but I was so excited, exhilarated, happy that the clothes didn\'t matter.  I was a woman.\n\nThursday was the same.  Worked at home in some non-descript clothes (tee-shirt and yoga pants, gotta love it), then a meeting at my son\'s therapy, then my own rescheduled therapy... blouse and shorts and ballet flats while I was out.  Didn\'t feel like messing with makeup two days running but then a lot of women don\'t.\n\nToday I was still identifying female and kind of freaking a little; it\'s never lasted so long in one stretch before.  I wanted to throw something different on at home but couldn\'t... that frustrated me too.  There was something at the zoo tonight for special needs children and their immediate families, so I took my son.  Transferred into a blouse that was... more translucent than I thought it was, but that was secondary to the sweat; 90 degrees in the shade, perspiration will happen.  But my son... he doesn\'t see the clothes or the gender identity, he sees the person.  He sees Daddy.  And while I\'m sure I got some second looks and some stares, the longer I was in the world, the less I cared.\n\nAnd then, on the drive home, the woman in me put her head on my shoulder and slept.

19/AMAB here, I've recently discovered that I'm genderfluid. I personally see myself as femboy/androgynous, and I'm interested in crossdressing. My pronouns are he/his and they/them.

I have a mustache, goatee, sideburns, and soul patch. My facial hair grows back quickly but has a very short maximum length. (I'm Asian, if that makes a difference.) My facial hair is black, but my skin is a light tan, so my facial hair shadow stands out very strongly. My mustache shadow also seems to be much darker than my goatee, soul patch, and sideburn shadows. As you can see, my facial hair grows in patches rather than a continuous beard or stubble. My soul patch doesn't connect to my goatee, unlike most AMAB people.

On the one hand, I want to hide my facial hair when presenting femme. /r/crossdressing seems to recommend using orange lipstick or color corrector on facial hair shadow, then going over with foundation. Any specific tips?

On the other hand, I want to grow out a van Dyke beard if possible. (think Colonel Sanders, Robert Downey Jr, Green Arrow) Is that possible with my current facial hair layout?

I'm super confused about how I want to present my gender. I don't know if I should keep my facial hair as is or get it removed. What should I do?

I accidentally got myself involved in a relationship problem between my best friend and their boyfriend and, being someone who has no relationship experience in my life, I don‚Äôt know what to do or how to help. 

My friend (R), who‚Äôs biologically a male, has told me they identified as gender fluid and wants to go for an androgynous look, but their boyfriend (M) isn‚Äôt comfortable with that, so their gender and desire to go androgynous was kept a secret for the longest time. A few nights ago they finally built up the courage to tell M, and as much as M is proud of R‚Äôs courage in coming out, he‚Äôs only attracted to guys, not non-binary people. He could respect it platonically, but this isn‚Äôt something he‚Äôll fall for. 

After hearing the news he‚Äôs been rapidly losing romantic/sexual attraction and both of us are unsure what to do. They still love each other but it‚Äôs one-sided romantic/sexual wise now and I‚Äôm not sure how to fix it. M‚Äôs giving R‚Äôs androgynous look a try but both M and me are already losing hope this relationship would last if we keep this up. The two of them are in the same friend group as well and if they do break up M says he‚Äôll get reminded of their relationship, so one of them has to leave. 

I‚Äôm keeping all what M told me a secret to R but I doubt anything we do would make things better. R understands it would take time for M to get used to and so do I but I didn‚Äôt think this would happen. I didn‚Äôt expect him to lose attraction and having breakdowns.

I am in my mid 30s and came out to myself slowly for years, then finally all at once when I came out to my spouse (all amazingly supportive on that front). The problem is, my mother in law is getting remarried super soon and I am not out to her. I am so grateful to have found some language to describe my experience but dont know anyone else who identifies as anything in this corner of the rainbow and my spouse is nothing but supportive but we are learning together.

I am in the bridal party and I really do want to be supportive and do not want to make any of her special moments about me by having any panic attacks brought on by dysphoria or drama.

I spend most of my time in what I am currently calling ""other"" gender, since it falls outside the binary but often is mixed with a flavor of masc. I tend to lean towards male more than female. But that can change in a few moments or maybe not until days or weeks. Super unpredictable. 

My female feels have been super scarce lately and, just when I thought she might might be showing up, I shaved my legs and was caught off guard by the following dysphoria and panic attack. (I know shaving is not a gendered activity but nevertheless, my hairless thighs made me super dysphoric) Now she is nowhere to be found and I think I was trying to force a female switch or something... it would make the wedding situation so much easier.

Every time someone genders me as female, lately, it's like a gut punch and I live somewhere that everyone uses ""ma'am"" and ""sir"" so it keeps happening.

I am super stressed by the huge amount of gendered language my MIL has been using about the event. And a ton of it has been directed at me as she tries to make me feel included and special. I appreciate the sentiment but just typing it is freaking me out. There will be even more of that talk on the day and I am trying to figure out how to get away with no makeup if necessary. 

Does anyone have any survival tips on how to get through this intact other than crossing my fingers and hoping I flow into female for the big day?

Any help is appreciated. Or even just knowing that I am not overreacting.

While I had a close friend who was MTF and had the full surgery, it wasn‚Äôt anything I ever considered. So didn‚Äôt see myself as trans

**Study Information:**

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals transition into parenthood, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.",genderfluid,Harvard GNC Parent Study,1564445921.0,"{'created_utc': 1564420721, 'id': 'cje9w8', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 4, 'selftext': '&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/02x0tcyf0ad31.jpg\n\n**Study Information:**\n\nThis is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents.

Basically I was born female and identified as female most of my life, well in reality I never questioned my gender identity as a younger child so I just let it be. At the age of around 15, I came out as bi to myself and my closest friends, I only really felt comfortable talking about my sexuality with my family a year ago since even though they claim to be liberal, my sister is the only one who has been unconditionally supportive of me, my parents and my other siblings confuse me with their attitudes... and to be honest accepting my own sexuality took me way longer than I actually thought it would. Sometime in the middle of 2018 my gender expression started to change from fairly feminine to androgynous, and then by the end of the year I started to question my gender altogether. Months pass and I realise I‚Äôm gender fluid. So there‚Äôs that to the backstory. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm almost 19 now and most days I can‚Äôt really tell what gender I feel, my gender usually showcases through my gender expression, because clothes that aren‚Äôt in line with the way I‚Äôm feeling just make me feel like crap. Recently the same thing has started happening with my body. I‚Äôm quite heavily chested, and in days that I feel very masculin I‚Äôve started to experience gender dysmorphia.

And then I realise that given how fast I fluctuate between male, female and non-binary, changing my body wouldn‚Äôt be smart. Regardless of that, I‚Äôm having a really hard time figuring this out and I feel like it‚Äôs really starting to take a toll on me. I don‚Äôt really have anyone I can talk to about this. I don‚Äôt have any friends who are trans, more so genderfluid, and I know my cis friends would just look at me weird if I told them about this. Then there‚Äôs my girlfriend, who doesn‚Äôt consider herself a female and hasn‚Äôt really labelled her gender, she just knows she‚Äôs not female. She does identify as a lesbian though. I have told her about all of this gender stuff, even the dick stuff, and she‚Äôs been nothing but amazingly supportive about it, and yet I feel like on one hand the whole dick thing might be too much. Like, recently I‚Äôve thought about strap ons and thought that maybe trying that would kind of help me explore the penis thing, but when I asked her on her take on it she said she isn‚Äôt too keen on it (to be fair I never specified us trying it which could also play a role in her attitude) but she has told me on several occasions that she‚Äôs repulsed by dicks, their shape and everything about them, which I understand since she just simply isn‚Äôt attracted to men, at least anatomically.

Background info: I'm a 19/AMAB Asian-American with extremely transphobic parents. I'm a college student financially dependent on them and I can't move out for the next 3 years.

Ever since I hit puberty, I've wanted to present more femme. I currently keep my hair cut really short (mostly because my parents make me get frequent haircuts, partly because I kinda like the feeling of short hair). For the near future, it looks like I'm stuck with short hair

I don't know what to do with my hair in the long run (i.e. after the next 3 years). I'm okay with either a clean-shaven face or a van Dyke beard. This is my first time growing out a van Dyke, so I don't know how long it'll get or how it'll look on me.

* On the one hand, it's been a childhood dream of mine to get a buzz cut and a crew cut (military-style haircut? idk). I am somewhat interested in presenting as a butch woman (e.g. Ellen DeGeneres) or effeminate man with short hair. (would it make sense to shave my body and leg hair or let it grow out?)

* On the other hand, I've also wanted to grow my hair long and be a conventional femme woman ever since puberty. I also want to be a long-haired guy (e.g. Loki or Thor from Marvel) or a femboy/drag queen (e.g. James from Pokemon). I could also style my hair in more creative ways if it's long, and shampoo and conditioner seem to be working okay on my current short hair. The problem is, I don't know how to take care of long hair, put it up in a ponytail or bun, deal with it, etc.

My hair grows rather slowly (2 inches in 3 months I think?) so it would take a long time for me to grow it out to a significant length. I also have a mercurial/impulsive/impatient personality so I might end up cutting my hair on a whim while growing it out, which would completely destroy years of progress.

On some days, I wish I had short hair, on other days I wish I had long hair. And on yet other days I wish I had androgynous-length hair (e.g. a bob or a mop). I could just keep my natural hair short and wear different wigs corresponding to my desired hair length, but at some point in my life I want to have naturally long hair.

I was born female and have identified it all my life, but I find that, as an adult, 99% of the time I strongly dislike being referred to as a ""woman"". There was like something inside my gut telling me to reject it, but I couldn't because it was technically correct. Even when I was a kid with dreams, I'd say like ""I want to be a fireman"", just so I didn't have to say woman (I didn't remember the word firefighter), but then I would get corrected with firewoman and would be kinda disappointed. Even when I was in high school and was interested in acting I said I wanted to be an ""actor"", but then was corrected with ""actress"". The thing is, I overall don't mind being called a *girl* or being referred to as she/her, so I wonder if it's just because that's what I'm used to. When I'm playing role-playing games with my friends, they already know that I'd rather play as a prince or a merman versus a princess or a mermaid. That being said, I don't feel like I am transgender because I don't feel like a man like... at all. Despite me refusing to wear dressed from middle school until recently, and wanting to wear boys clothes the majority of the time, I don't feel manly. Idk if it's because I physically don't look like one, because, I also just want to look like a skinny boy so bad, but I am the exact opposite: a fat girl, which I am still fine with???? All my life I hated being fat and became body positive about it and I no longer fear it anymore, I embrace it. That's for another time though, the point is, Gender Fluidity sounds like it's the right option for me. I know I'm not non-binary, because, I got advice to make a blog under a non-binary identity, and it didn't feel right for me at all. I'm just so confused. If I am gender fluid, I'm not really sure how it works? Like, I question if I'm even in the right place here? Am I just a cross-dressing female and this is where I should be? I was thinking about creating a drag king persona and seeing how that goes, but I just don't know where to start.

Even when I was a kid with dreams, I\'d say like ""I want to be a fireman"", just so I didn\'t have to say woman (I didn\'t remember the word firefighter), but then I would get corrected with firewoman and would be kinda disappointed. Even when I was in high school and was interested in acting I said I wanted to be an ""actor"", but then was corrected with ""actress"". The thing is, I overall don\'t mind being called a *girl* or being referred to as she/her, so I wonder if it\'s just because that\'s what I\'m used to. When I\'m playing role-playing games with my friends, they already know that I\'d rather play as a prince or a merman versus a princess or a mermaid. That being said, I don\'t feel like I am transgender because I don\'t feel like a man like... at all. Despite me refusing to wear dressed from middle school until recently, and wanting to wear boys clothes the majority of the time, I don\'t feel manly. Idk if it\'s because I physically don\'t look like one, because, I also just want to look like a skinny boy so bad, but I am the exact opposite: a fat girl, which I am still fine with???? All my life I hated being fat and became body positive about it and I no longer fear it anymore, I embrace it. That\'s for another time though, the point is, Gender Fluidity sounds like it\'s the right option for me. I know I\'m not non-binary, because, I got advice to make a blog under a non-binary identity, and it didn\'t feel right for me at all. I\'m just so confused. If I am gender fluid, I\'m not really sure how it works? Like, I question if I\'m even in the right place here? Am I just a cross-dressing female and this is where I should be? I was thinking about creating a drag king persona and seeing how that goes, but I just don\'t know where to start.  \n\n\nSorry, I\'m rambling. I just wanted to get this out there and potentially get advice from all of you.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': ""I Don't Know What I Am"", 'created': 1564537649.0}"
