I‚Äôm going to start a gofundme to save up some for top surgery. Yay!! 


I‚Äôm unsure if I want nipple grafts or not. I plan on getting double incision, and I‚Äôve heard healing after surgery is easier without nipples. I‚Äôve also heard it can be slightly less expensive, a HUGE plus if possible. 


Im unemployed and i have ptsd, cant work atm. Had to quit my job cause I kept having panic attacks at work and i couldnt take it anymore. I got diagnosed with ptsd, trying to get my shit together and heal. I likely wont be able to use my insurance since im covered through my conservative christian grandfather‚Äôs military insurance, and there‚Äôs no way they‚Äôd cover it if I‚Äôm not on T. I know of a relatively local doctor who‚Äôll do top surgery on enby folks not on T as long as they have a therapist note. So my plan is to crowdfund the money and get the surgery. I might as well try, hope of improvement feels better than sitting and doing nothing.



TLDR: Does getting nipple grafts or not getting nipple grafts effect the price/healing time of surgery? Are there any better options for healthcare crowdfunding, or is gofundme my best bet for US?

I asked his permission to share the copypasta here because my buddy here makes some very enlightened points that made me think ""shit, I really, really needed to hear this. Other people might need to hear it too"". It's a lengthy post, but it's all tiny stream-of-consciousness text-chatter, so it's actually a relatively short read. I decided to share the entire transcript because...trans solidarity in action, yo. ~~Also maybe I'm biased but my bud and I have great chemistry and could TOTALLY make this a podcast kinda deal.~~

 

***ME:***

* \[figuring out my gender\] has definitely been a Struggle
* half the battle has been accepting that I don't have all the answers yet, and the ones I do have might not line up with other people's, but that's okay and doesn't make my daily experiences any less real

&amp;#x200B;

***HIM:***

* Hey, figuring out you don't have to have it all figured out is a big thing too
* Hey, do you mind me asking- what are your pronouns? I know you were considering using they or she, but now I don't remember which you settled with.  


***ME:***

* still going by she/her irl while I figure shit out, but I appreciate they/them or he/him

  
***HIM:***

* Any preference on which?

  
***ME:***

* honestly any tbh! pronouns aren't really a source of dysphoria for me or anything, mostly I just enjoy hearing pronouns that aren't she/her because it feels Validating. (I'm leaning towards IDing as nonbinary-transmasculine? my gender identity's kinda all over the place but my relationship with my body is def very male-esque and I'm weighing up eventually trying to get on T)

&amp;#x200B;

***HIM:***

* Ah I can relate to that
* Back when I thought I was NB, it was the ""not she"" that relieved dysphoria, and then I finally realized that ""he"" actually added euphoria  


***ME:***

* yeah, makes a lot of sense that your understanding would progress like that!

  
***HIM:***

* Well the important part is honestly what makes you feel best
* And fuck everyone who says different

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* I keep stressing myself out thinking ""I'm not guy enough"" (read: not trans enough) and keep having to remind myself that it's okay I don't have to BE a guy
* I just want to be a damn handsome human being

  
***HIM:***

* I don't wanna be that guy but stressing out you're not trans enough is often a symptom of dysphoria

  
***ME:***

* that's actually really validating to hear, haha

  
***HIM:***

* The ""man I wish I was trans enough"" thought train
* But yeah (1) you don't have to be a guy and (2) there's no wrong way to be a guy either
* Or a girl, or NB for that matter

  
***ME:***

* I really needed to hear this shit. thanks man
* honestly I was obsessing for such a long-ass time and making myself mentally ill over it....while completely missing the forest for the trees because cis people don't stress themselves to sickness over their gender

  
***HIM:***

* Side note
* If it's ok for a cis guy to be gnc (and it totally is), it's ok for a trans guy to be GNC too
* Right!! That too
* I went through my whole girly girl phase bc I was kinda trying to force myself to be a woman without any real understanding of womanhood
* In essence, I spent several years being exactly what TERFs try to convince people trans women are
* Based on stereotype and shallow reflection
* And being true to myself actually helped me have a less toxic relation to femininity as a whole, ironically

  
***ME:***

* that's awesome though
* I mean, it makes sense that once you felt secure in who you were, you'd have a better relationship to femininity when you didn't feel the need to shove your face into it

  
***HIM:***

* I‚Äôm kinda on the 'when I pass' train rn but
* When I pass I wanna start wearing some women's clothing, etc., and it's less
* Exactly
* Shoving my face into it and more exploring it as an option
* It's a game of 'wanna be seen as a girlish man not a mannish girl' in my head tbh

  
***ME:***

* I was wondering for a long time whether I could ""really"" be NB because ‚Äî besides the concept being still relatively new to me ‚Äî I didn't really...feel like I was in the ""wrong"" body as a kid or teen. I don't know that I've ever been traditionally dysphoric in a physical sense, not until very recently when I've become hyper aware that the way people look at me isn't the way I see myself

  
***HIM:***

* Well there's no one set way to feel dysphoria
* You may not agree with me, but I believe that dysphoria is kind of the defining factor of being trans
* Just that people misunderstand what it is
* It's not one SET experience
* More a definition enclosing any and all ""I'm not comfortable as my SAB"" and/or ""I feel better as another gender""
* I just really resent that people use it to try and push ""you're not trans if you don't experience dysphoria MY WAY""

  
***ME:***

* yeah man, I can get behind that

  
***HIM:***

* Which is where the whole ""you don't need dysphoria"" backlash began in my experience
* From the bleachers in a sense

  
***ME:***

* yeah there seems to be a narrative that you can only be trans if your body brings you excruciating, unavoidable pain and it's like...whoa, there. I get that's a completely legit thing a lot of trans people do experience, but that's also really fucking bleak to have a bar of ""you must suffer this much to ride""

  
***HIM:***

* Like... Okay a bit tmi but. For example I don't think about my genitals 9/10 times
* I‚Äôm ace, I rarely need to use them, but
* I‚Äôd be fine enough if a proper dick technology didn't happen in my life

  
***ME:***

* also: the pain of getting your dick stuck in a zipper

  
***HIM:***

* But I can't go through my life without getting rid of the bouncy annoyances on my chest

  
***ME:***

* who needs it
* ahahah legit  


***HIM:***

* Like would I like a dick? Yeees. But am I gonna be in pain every time I exist? No.
* And then there's like
* Smaller stuff that is more dysphoric
* Voice
* Arm hair (don't laugh)
* Bone structure but I can't fix that  


***ME:***

* I won't laugh I want hairier legs

  
***HIM:***

* My wrists arent five inches around
* I have princess hands
* :(

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* SAME, tiny hands

&amp;#x200B;

***HIM:***

* Like, can't find a smart watch that won't give me the stereotypical Chinese hat effect
* *\[drawn diagram of a skinny-ass wrist with a disproportionately big watch-face strapped to it\]*
* You know what I mean?
* I have one from Amazon that has decently good reviews and I hope is small and comfy enough
* Lol even a Mi band is too big and it pisses me uffff

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* I feel like, for the most part, I like my body. I'm not dysphoric when I look in the mirror. would I like a flat chest? yes, at least when I'm wearing a shirt. but I don't mind my boobs. when I look in the mirror I actually like what I see. I see my androgynous features and fluffy-ass hair and broad shoulders and I'm like ""hayyyyyy there, handsome boi-o""
* ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and then I go serve customers at work, and get called ""darling"" by some over friendly dude, and am super aware of how high my voice is in customer service mode, and feel suddenly overwhelmed that people are looking at me and reading me as female
* I‚Äôm not dysphoric until I'm exposed to other people's perceptions of me
* AND HAHAH YES I TOTALLY GET UR WATCH ANALOGY
* but yeah people don't see me how I see myself
* like when I post selfies and get told (well-meaningly) that I'm ""pretty""

  
***HIM:***

* Hmm, I look in the mirror with a shirt on and see a guy
* But I look in the mirror with my shirt off and see a guy with the wrong stuff on his chest
* Like
* It shouldn't be connected to my androgynous looking parts
* If that makes sense?

&amp;#x200B;

***ME:***

* yeah that makes sense my dude  


***HIM:***

* I for one think you're dashing

  
***ME:***

* aw shucks

  
***HIM:***

* But the other people's perception dysphoria is something I've never been able to really verbalize like you just did
* I‚Äôm going about my day and suddenly it's you (fem) or madam and it's just. No don't look at me, can I go in a hole and not be seen
* You expressed it so well

  
***ME:***

* god it's great having other trans people to talk to. I feel like we can fill in the blanks in each other's vernacular
* (idk if that's the right word for it or not, but like, def some experiences are hard to verbalise or even put your finger on until someone else is like ""okay so"" and you're like ""YES. YES THAT"")

  
***HIM:***

* Sounds right to me

  
***ME:***

* (‚Äúthat is a thing that happens to me too but I've never known how to call it"")

  
***HIM:***

* I call it same hat syndrome haha

  
***ME:***

* great name

  
***HIM:***

* Like I have cis friends I can trust and tell about these things, but when I meet another trans person it's like, hey! You understand this from the inside!
* Kinda like meeting another aspie in my case
* ‚Äòyes you understand why I'd rather be hungry for hours than eat That Texture ever again'

  
***ME:***

* yeah I feel the same when talking with other bi people or other depressives
* there's something to be said for sharing experiences
* and having walked the same paths

  
**HIM:**

* I think the term same hat syndrome should be widely used tbt

I saw a post that went like that, but for nonbinary folk.  

Now my kneejerk reaction was to think ""ew chaser"", but that's not really a chaser is it? The problem with chasers is that they fetishize the trans experience, specifically going after trans men or women because they are trans.

I don't know. I just left that conversation last night feeling so invalidated, and it just made it worse when my boyfriend said the usual cutesy boyfriend things. (Not gonna go into details but basically just calling me or referring to how I'm a girl/how I'm cute. lmao)

97,2019-03-04 03:19:35,ax29yy,4,10,"I‚Äôm curious to see if anyone else can relate to this, and has anything interesting to say on the matter, since we hold a curious place in society where we often have to define for ourselves what roles we play, outside of the gender binary.

I‚Äôm 21 AFAB (normally wouldn‚Äôt list my AGAB but I think it‚Äôs relevant here in the context of socialization and such) and have been reflecting a lot lately on my past (lesbian-coded) relationships. I went through a breakup a few months back with a girl I was falling in love with for my inability to stick up for myself (in a way that was going to interfere with our relationship). Since the breakup I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my roles in romantic relationships, and the greater world. 

I find myself to be a very passive person. I have historically had issues with getting pushed around, not asserting my desires, kind of just generally trying too hard to be a people pleaser. In relationships I often find myself yielding to whatever my partner wants‚Äîif they‚Äôre happy, I‚Äôm happy! I‚Äôd let them pick the dates and things of that nature. 

But I often find myself in general wanting to take a more masculine presence in this world. But I still want to be soft and gentle. I want to have a commanding presence, I want to lead, I want to support other people. But I don‚Äôt think I really know how to do that. 

I was journalling before and without much conscious thought I wrote, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to be a lady, I don‚Äôt know how to be a gentleman.‚Äù 

I don‚Äôt think I know how to be the ‚Äúlady‚Äù in a relationship either. I struggle to accept compliments, I struggle to show appreciation for my partner‚Äôs efforts even when I feel appreciation inside my mind, I find a lot of discomfort letting myself be truly submissive in intimate contexts‚Äîgeneral vulnerability issues, I guess. 

I apologize for all the heteronormative language in describing this. It‚Äôs just the only language I have. But I recognize all of this is WAY more fluid than that. 

I guess I‚Äôm just confused about how I see myself in relationships, because I don‚Äôt feel I ever truly learned how to perform fully one of the ‚Äúsocietally acceptable‚Äù ways of being in a relationship, and so I was never able to reject it either.

I went through a breakup a few months back with a girl I was falling in love with for my inability to stick up for myself (in a way that was going to interfere with our relationship). Since the breakup I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about my roles in romantic relationships, and the greater world. \n\nI find myself to be a very passive person. I have historically had issues with getting pushed around, not asserting my desires, kind of just generally trying too hard to be a people pleaser.

I‚Äôd let them pick the dates and things of that nature. \n\nBut I often find myself in general wanting to take a more masculine presence in this world. But I still want to be soft and gentle.

It‚Äôs just the only language I have. But I recognize all of this is WAY more fluid than that. \n\nI guess I‚Äôm just confused about how I see myself in relationships, because I don‚Äôt feel I ever truly learned how to perform fully one of the ‚Äúsocietally acceptable‚Äù ways of being in a relationship, and so I was never able to reject it either.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in my thirties, AMAB, and basically been a ""man"" to the public my entire life. I came out as bi in college, but the idea of gender is not something I've ever talked about with anyone. The only person who knows what I'm about to say is my wife.

&amp;#x200B;

Not all the time, but sometimes I like makeup. Sometimes I like cute dresses and such. I worry about not being manly in front of other people. I'm not aggressive enough and wonder if I was born with low testosterone. I fantasize about having different parts, but I've never felt like I was 'born in the wrong body'. I don't want to transition. I don't know what dysphoria feels like but I don't think I experience it. I feel uncomfortable claiming a trans label because of this but feel more comfortable with something like gender fluid or nb. 

But then sometimes I think that I'm overthinking it and I'm just a cross-dresser and should stop acting like I belong.

I have a pretty intense impostor syndrome because of all the things I listed above and because everyone assumes I'm cis, I feel like I don't have the right to tell anyone I'm not because I've never experienced the 'struggle' of being anything more than an overweight white boy.

&amp;#x200B;

As I've gotten older, i've become more and more disillusioned with the idea of gender in general, and see myself as just a collection of preferences. Saying something is 'manly' to me is no less a generalization than saying 'white men can't jump'.  When I was a kid I would paint my nails, but didn't really consider that 'girly' until people told me it was. I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I don't really understand how people work, so maybe I'm wrong?

&amp;#x200B;

I just see things on the internet like nb and trans and GNC and cross-dresser and I don't know my own feelings enough to know if any of them apply to me, I just know how I feel. My sex is male and I'm ok with that, but when someone talks about gender I can't really find anything to connect myself to. I'm a mix. Or I'm nothing. Does anyone else feel this way?

I have hated having these lumps on my chest since puberty but somehow the thought of having top surgery never really registered to my brain... or gotten on my radar if that makes sense. But since I started wearing a binder I have loved it and rarely ever go outside without one.

But like, there‚Äôs just always a lot of questioning and insecurities I guess? Do I REALLY have gender dysphoria? Am I just a transTRENDER seeking attention?

I have a supportive parent (the other not so much but meh) so the cost of a private surgeon isn‚Äôt really that much of a problem. Where I live there‚Äôs good ones that do informed consent too so I don‚Äôt even need a letter. But should I still see a gender specialist to sort out my feelings??

Same with the experiences shared here. It's been really nice, it's also been really difficult.

Anyways, point being that I think most people assume I'm ""male"" though the more time passes the less I feel associated to that pronoun and the more irked I feel about being called he/him though I'm still not confident enough to ask people to call me they/them. So when this date and I were talking about writing and I brought up cursive she asked if I had any paper and I did so she wrote a couple of lines in cursive.

She had really beautiful handwriting. It was very flowy and precise and looked like art. I was jealous.

I've always hated my handwriting. It's sloppy and messy and I mostly just make an excuse for it to myself because I tend to write really quickly. Lately however I've been journaling in cursive and some days I don't hate my handwriting as much as I used to. And even when I slip back to non-cursive writing it feels like it's been influenced and so it's not as bad.

So when I jotted down a few lines and she said ""you've got really masculine handwriting"" it just crushed me. I know she didn't mean anything by it and there's no way she could have known how that would have affected me, but oh did it.

I'm now going to look up some tutorials or something to try and work on my handwriting.

(There is talk of menstruation in this post so if that makes you uncomfortable here's your warning)
So at the moment I'm on depo provera, a progestin birth control shot that I get once every 3 months. I'm not taking it for contraceptive purposes, I take it because birth control stops the excruciatingly painful menstrual cramps I would have otherwise (otc pain killers don't have any effect on me) and because this particular form of birth control stops me from menstrating all together which has done a LOT of good for my gender dysphoria, I haven't menstruated in over a year. I really love my birth control.

I plan on starting testosterone soon, and I'm assuming that I'm going to have to stop getting my depo shot once I start T, causing me to start menstruating again untill the T kicks in and stops my periods again (this sounds like actual hell but I know it would be worth it in the long run). Does anyone know for sure if testosterone and progestin can't be taken together? I'd really love to be able to do both but I've got a feeling that they'll interact or that the progestin will stop the T from making me all manly and stuff. I tried to look on Google but couldn't find the info I need and I don't think my PCP will be able to help me either.

I'm wondering how you all deal with eating at restaurants, the kind of restaurants where they start every interaction with a gendered title. They'll greet people with 'Good day sir / ma'am', they'll ask you what you'd like to drink using 'sir, what can I pour for you?' and they'll explain the dishes by going by gender 'for the lady, I've got a [description]'. (I'm not a native English speaker so forgive me if the examples sound a bit weird). Basically, anytime the waitstaff comes by your table, they'll address everyone by a gendered title. 

Which is super annoying, because when I go out to eat, I just want to be served my food and not be misgendered. I'm now at the point where I'm actually a bit confused when someone addresses me with 'ma'am', I'm prone to looking around to check they're really talking to me. And it just sort of jolts me out of the pleasant time of enjoying food and drinks, I'm constantly reminded of 'oh crap, people don't even know that nonbinary people exist' etc. 

On the other hand - I don't really know an alternative title that I can provide to the waitstaff. Mx would work in English (I think?), but not in Dutch (what I'm looking for is a title that can also be a proper noun, similar to 'gentleman' or 'lady'. Unfortunately, 'person' also doesn't work grammatically :(). I've looked around on the web for a bit, apparently the whole gender thing is really entrenched in fine dining culture. I think I could get over being always served first, but if they could just not call me by the wrong gender...

TW: this might trigger dysphoria in people with a lot of social dysphoria so if that applies to you please don't read, thanks

Hello :) 

I posted this exact same thing in /r/asktransgender a while ago and got a lot of comments leaning towards one decision but i feel like there was a binary mtf bias there, and like i don't know if I'm strictly binary, plus i didn't say all the things i should have so ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Anyways

I'm MtF, my dysphoria is 90% physical dysphoria, over my naked body and how clothes fit me, and 9.999% genital dysphoria, specifically the gonads. Gross and untuckable. There's maybe a bit of social dysphoria maybe?

I am on HRT and i feel pretty ok with my transition process. I don't think i can ever pass enough to ever live stealth as a woman though. Which I'd definitely prefer but realistically I'd have to wait more on HRT to see and i really don't think my chances are big if at all there. 

I got way larger than the average shoulders for an adult male (and I'm not an adult yet), i got a terrible brow ridge and lots of minorly masculine features that can't change w hrt that lead to androgynous face at best and i don't have remotely the discipline to actually lose weight enough to shed my denial-bodybuilder-past-self muscles. Plus my tits are growing super far apart, you can easily fit a third one in between and still got plenty of space. And I'm not saying that from a dysphoric perspective, i am not feeling particularly dysphoric as of writing this. I'm just being realistic here. 

That being said, i don't have an interest in being feminine. I like my soft butchy looks, i like being blunt and direct and i honestly feel very very indifferent about my voice. I also like very short but feminine hairstyles and those don't really mask my brow ridge or slanted forehead, so i do look like a feminine boy with that

I mean i can totally tolerate living as the most infinitessimally feminine boy on earth. I don't care what people call me honestly. I'd actually prefer for people to call me a he if they look at me me and see a he. Or a she if they look at me and see a she.

On the other hand, being platonically close and touchy with other women, people not thinking im a pedo if i find their children adorable, people not being freaked out if i touch them, people assuming i actually have a uterus and so on (like oh my god please) being called a woman and so on would make me feel incredibly good. For that i will have to pass pretty well tho. 

What doesn't feel good is thinking that people see me as a man but play along. Or people seeing a man in front of them and telling me that i look ""gorgeous yas queen"" or people feeling like i have failed at transitioning even though i developed masc features and can't do anything about them. 
 
I don't want people to call me a woman if they don't see that in me. I'd seriously be totally ok with people calling me a man if they genuinely see a man in front of them.

I feel like I'd rather accept the horrible damage T has done on me and find a way to be comfortable with the weird inbetweenie wide-ass boy w boobs aesthetic i got

And if in the comimg years i manage to magically pass as cis, well I'd be fucking glad cuz that'll be really really comfortable. 

So i don't really know how these feelings play into a social transition. I'm really confused as to how to proceed with socially transitioning. ",NonBinary,I got next to no social dysphoria.

I'm not sure exactly what that means for me yet but it feels right and it makes me super happy. I've shaved my legs and I'll be allowing myself to experiment with make-up beyond nailpolish soon. Every step to mixing my femme and masculine sides has made me more and more happy. My parents and sisters have been super supportive and that's all awesome. Only problem is me.

As I said this change is making me super happy, but I've always been bullied for being femme even when trying to be as manly as possible and I had my angry-anti-feminist phase which has resulted in me kind of not trusting my own feelings.

I am an AFAB nonbinary person. I have a job interview next week and need to go shopping. My current job is very casual so I don't own many professional clothing.

I'm looking for recommendations. Attaching pictures/links of examples would be very helpful.

I'd love to spend as little as possible haha, I will probably look at thrift stores, target, jcpenney, gap, etc.

I would like to not wear heels (boots would be fine but I don't think they're professional?). I would be fine with a dress but would prefer a pants option if possible.

It can be business casual/not super formal.

My father remarried after just 6 months alone after my mothers death.

My siblings are married in long term relationships.

It seems in my family, long relationships are crucial to their stability.

Yet, here I am alone.

Does anyone have resources for those that have to, or are forced to survive solitary confinement?

293,2019-03-09 16:18:06,az526r,2,1,"So I go to these spiritual festival camps in the summer, with all sorts of hippie bollocks stuff. These camps for years have had a ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs space‚Äù and a ‚Äúmen‚Äôs space‚Äù, and for this year are planning to add a ‚Äúnonbinary space‚Äù too. The organisers are having some problems figuring out what to do with it though, as the board members are cis and don‚Äôt know much about nb stuff. 

For reference, the women‚Äôs and men‚Äôs spaces are normally a safe place for men and women to hang out in where the opposite gender can‚Äôt enter, and sometimes there are activities and sessions there. They‚Äôre also run by a specific person who keeps the space  and organises what goes on in there. 

I got involved in an email discussion about the space as I‚Äôm genderqueer myself and someone who was more involved in the organisation thought I could offer some advice. We‚Äôve definitely run into some problems though, the main ones being:
- what if the space just gets used by cis men and women to talk about their gender differences, because no that‚Äôs not what it should be for
- not wanting to exclude people who actually *are* questioning their gender by being too strict on rules
- accidentally outing people by having a physical place that only nbs go into where everyone else can see who goes in and out
- are there even any nbs who would benefit from the space or is it just curious cis people who may mean well but might still complicate things for shy questioning people 
-what to even do there

Sorry this might be difficult to understand, feel free to ask for more clarification if that‚Äôs needed.

I'm just sick of binary.

&amp;#x200B;

Like.

This goes against the canon of what I'm supposed to believe, but I don't think anyone is really binary. I don't think gender really means anything. I think that if everyone stopped believing in it, it would go away, and that people *need* to stop believing in it. I ... sort of think of myself as a gender atheist, I guess.

I think ""gender-deconstruction"" used to exist as an idea, but I feel like its been buried, and that if I say this now, people will say I'm discriminating against binary people... but like... that's what I believe.

&amp;#x200B;

I write novels set in worlds where there is no gender construct at all. The characters' bodies - at least their upper bodies - are all visible, but they don't treat each other any differently based on that. They all have long hair and they all wear a lot of jewelry, because long hair and jewelry are as common in their culture as blue jeans are in most real cultures. (I'm... probably going to write it as a comic, to get around the whole pronoun thing in English.)

The characters are all supposed to be attractive, but none of them are attractive in what anyone would call ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" ways. (Except, Westerners would probably think it's all too feminine, because 21st-century Westerners can't even look at the slightest smidge of lace without pulling a weapon on it.)

&amp;#x200B;

My goal in life is to get a day job teaching English, smile and nod and get through work without letting them into my life, and then make my real career writing novels; keep the day job until I get permanent residence, or until the art that I'm living in Tokyo for spreads to other countries and then I'd follow it there; and just... find people who I can relate through by spreading my novels online, and live socially with them, and not be part of ""society"" until some society changes. 

Like... on the surface/mainstream/whatever, Japan may be backwards in regards to a lot of gender-related things, but the art that I like has male characters being soft, and wearing skirts and frills, and just, being tender. They don't call them nonbinary (because the audience doesn't have the vocabulary for it, probably), but they are genderless. (I'm mostly talking about theatre, but there are some things in other media, too).

Basically, Japan does French things better than France in general, but specifically, anything anyone has said that only French women can do, there are Japanese boys that do it better nowadays. 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I want ""identifying as nonbinary and doing a more-or-less equal amount of both masculine and feminine things, and not being afraid of looking too-this, or not-this-enough"" to be a cultural shift, and I want that to lead to completely getting rid of the concept of ""too-this, or not-this-enough"".

I don't want ""X"" to be an option for gender, I want IDs and surveys and profiles, etc., to just stop recording gender altogether, because it's not their business and it just reinforces sexism. 

&amp;#x200B;

Identifying as binary doesn't give anyone anything. Being nonbinary means you can do whatever you want. You can do any masculine thing, any feminine thing, and anything that's such a combination of both that binary people can't even imagine it. Being binary is the same as putting yourself in prison. 

That's how I feel, but... other people still think they need it. I know all the reasons they say it's important to them, but I still think they're just hurting themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't think that having buckets called ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" adds anything to the ideas, styles, concepts, etc. in those buckets. I think it actually flattens and cheapens those things, and that without the buckets those things would be better off, because they would be allowed to shine for their own merit, and not as just a piece of something.

382,2019-03-11 19:21:59,azxigk,9,5,"originally i was going to submit this to ask a transgender, but then i realized it was less asking and more rambling, so i deleted it and reposted here.

so: the basics about me. 36 years old, afab, bisexual, think i'm non-binary, definitely NOT cis. my egg started cracking about seven months ago? i'm out online, but irl only my spouse and some close friends know. still working on figuring out the pronoun thing.

almost six weeks ago, i finally got up the courage to do what i've been fantasizing about for 15+ years, even since i knew they were a thing and buy a packer off of amazon. (and yet it took me until last summer to realize i might not be cis...) two days later i was in possession of a small mr limpy and the moment i put it in, i felt RIGHT in a way i wasn't entirely prepared for. like, i wanted to have this dick down my pants  24/7. if you'd have asked me before, i would have said i didn't have bottom dysphoria at all, but i sure have packing *euphoria* all right.

anyway, i've been packing at home for the last month and a bit. it took me a while to find a way i like to pack and also to get some male underwear since at the time mr limpy came, i'd only had girl panties, but i managed to get my hands on a pair of 7packs of boxer briefs with the openings in the front. i've been calling them dick flaps for lack of a better technical term. anyway, i've found that if i stash mr limpy there, turned to the side, he stays where he should and i have the bulge and weight in my pants that i like.

(relatedly, it turns out i love wearing boxer briefs and prefer them to all other underwear. i ended up wearing girl panties again after over a week in boxer briefs and it felt so *weird*.)

anyway. yesterday night was the first time i packed in public and i kind of did it stealthily, since i was at work (retail at a big box store) and i am so very not out at work. they all think i'm a woman and so do our customers. but i wore baggy jeans and asked my spouse to tell me if he could tell i had my dick in and he couldn't. but i *could* and it was nice and reassuring to have it there and i managed to pull it off without getting into trouble. it was a good feeling and i'll probably try it again tonight.

anyway! i've had several personal reactions to all this packing i've been doing and i guess i wanted to check in and see if they're... idk, normal? if they make sense to people? ANYWAY.

**Reaction 1:** internal revision/confirmation of gender. like, i'd come to the conclusion i probably wasn't cis before i got the packer, but ever since i got my cock i've felt a lot *more* sure in my genderqueerness. i think it's because getting the cock has made me really notice the masculine/male parts of me? before i would have said that i'm not always a girl, but now i'm definitely sure that when i'm not a girl i AM a boy.

**Reaction 2:** thinking of my packer as a part of me. this has especially been happening since i finally found the way to pack i feel comfortable with, but i found myself referring to it as 'my junk' in conversation with a friend. and it feels really good to think of it as my genitals now, not just an emotional support penis.

**Reaction 3:** body language. especially sitting. like, granted i've always felt more comfortable and natural sitting with open legs (and i remember as a young teen being critted about taking up too much space and feeling stupid embarrassed) but wearing mr limpy, my legs just spring apart whenever i sit down. before i started packing, i could close my legs and be okay, but now holding them closed tight just feels unnatural. and i've found that more masculine ways of walking and standing *also* feel more natural now. and i think i dig this. 

**Reaction 4:** i really love to touch my dick. like, not even necessarily in a sexual way. it's just so reassuring to reach down and feel that it's there. when i packed in public last night, instead of in private at home, the hardest part (once i figured out i wouldn't be caught and get in trouble) was that i had to mostly leave it alone for six hours. i'm thinking maybe i should get some baggy men's jeans at some point to belt off, since they have such long-ass pockets that i could probably stick my hands in at an angle and brush against where i've got the head, so i can get that reassurance all stealthily. but man. i just super love to touch this dick.

**Reaction 4.5:** all that said, it's like my libido has come back from the war. when i first got my packer, i felt really turned on by it. i was always wet when i had it on. and even though that's died down in the intervening weeks, i *do* feel like a more sexual person than i have for basically years. i feel way more affectionate with my spouse. also, i've started to masturbate a lot more often and more regularly and almost more casually? like i used to have to make it a whole production to get started, but now i just reach down and *do* it. and here's the really crazy thing: i'm doing it by jerking off the packer and i'm actually getting *off* that way. despite it not touching anything. isn't that *wild*?

ANYWAY. i just wanted to check in i guess, see if any of these reactions are things that other people can relate to too. maybe i want some reassurance that this is normal.

Due to a strict lifestyle I didn't find out I was LGBTQ until I was 19, and I find myself actively gender questioning for the first time at 21.

I often don't feel like a girl. I just feel like a person. The constant gendering seems unnecessary; it's tiring to constantly put off the vibe that people expect from cis women. It feels like a chore. I find myself wishing I would find out I was intersex so that I could have a physical reason to be a wide mix of feminine and masculine.

She/her pronouns don't bother me, but I feel like people are missing some of me when they call me a girl. I'm comfortable in my body and don't feel a need to change it. I don't ever feel like a boy, but I do sometimes feel more comfortable if people look at me as a mainly masculine person. This changes day to day. I like to dress in a femme way sometimes, but it irritates me when cis men look at me like I'm a cis woman. I'm unsure if this is because I'm gynesexual and they're barking up the wrong tree, or if irritation is rooted in misgendering.

I'm terrified of what my family would say if it turns out I actually am genderfluid. They don't believe in more than the binary. It may not be worth the trouble of fighting them, but I want to live authentically as myself (whoever that is).

I'm hoping for advice in how I can make him more comfortable in our daily lives with his gender without outing him to others before he is ready.

&amp;#x200B;

Our environment in college is accepting, but he is not ready to come out to the general public yet and hiding is making him very depressed. I would like to be able to do little things for him, whether that is in our sex lives, or in little gestures, or possibly small gifts, as our anniversary is coming up, that will make him feel less uncomfortable with himself and his presentation. So, feminine presenting AMAB non binary people or trans women, even - (sorry to mention gender at birth; unsure of another way to put this; let me know of any edits I can make to make this better fit the community rules) how, before transition or coming out publicly, were your loved ones able to make you more comfortable? I don't experience much discrimination in how I choose to present, and from what I understand that it can be more complicated sometimes when trying to present femininely when you are perceived by others as male than the other way around, and so I am hoping for advice from people who have experienced what he may be going through right now.

I would like to be able to do little things for him, whether that is in our sex lives, or in little gestures, or possibly small gifts, as our anniversary is coming up, that will make him feel less uncomfortable with himself and his presentation. So, feminine presenting AMAB non binary people or trans women, even - (sorry to mention gender at birth; unsure of another way to put this; let me know of any edits I can make to make this better fit the community rules) how, before transition or coming out publicly, were your loved ones able to make you more comfortable? I don't experience much discrimination in how I choose to present, and from what I understand that it can be more complicated sometimes when trying to present femininely when you are perceived by others as male than the other way around, and so I am hoping for advice from people who have experienced what he may be going through right now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you so much!

In my senior year of high school, I came out as trans. I reluctantly went to a trans therapist. 

I went back in the closet time and time and time again, due to my fear of dying alone.

I want the haircut that makes me confident. I want to live life like I'm young instead of hiding away in fear. I limit myself due to my hate of my own body.

When I first transitioned, I was so incredibly happy. It was the consequences that poisoned my heart and now I feel numb.

Like... It\'s not a rare thing. I\'ve had guys be so creepy towards me because I\'m not cis or because they thought I\'m a girl. They\'ve hit on me a bunch, they\'ve talked down to me, they\'ve acted like I know nothing about the game when I\'m a higher level than them and have been playing for longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nJust... The misgendering and the sexism piled on top are so unbearable. I\'d rather just never use voice chat again, but so many people ignore the text chat in the game I play that it\'s a really inefficient way to communicate with team members.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI wish gamer guys would stop freaking out whenever they think someone might be a girl, and I wish more of them would just stop asking ""Are you a guy or a girl?"" when I say I\'m neither. You don\'t need to know my assigned gender at birth. You don\'t need to know my life story. I just logged on to have some fun, not explain my very existence to everyone who hears me speak.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt\'s not that hard to respect someone when they say, ""actually, I\'m not a girl or a guy.

I‚Äôve been devouring non binary podcasts, books and also this reddit, and thus far being much more conscious about my body has increased my sense of dysphoria. 
I‚Äôm not completely flat chested but my breasts are small have a weird shape and are ‚Äúpointing to different directions‚Äù so to speak. They hurt bad when I‚Äôm on my period too. I‚Äôve always hated wearing bras because of the constricting feeling and being more likely to be catcalled in the street. 
I‚Äôve never tried a binder but I‚Äôm afraid they will feel even more constricted. 
Since my job now doesn‚Äôt have dressing code I‚Äôve have started to stop wearing bras and wear more baggy clothes and still I feel I‚Äôve lost self confidence in social situations. 
‚ÄîQ: should I still try a binder? 
On the bottom department, I‚Äôve never had bad feelings about my external genitalia but due to endometriosis I‚Äôve always hated ‚Äúhaving a uterus‚Äù both because I‚Äôm in terrible pain due to endometriosis and baby talk around my family. I never want to have children and feel a lot of anxiety when discussing the topic with gynaecologists or anyone. 
‚ÄîQ: I‚Äôm willing to give up my ‚Äúbeing a mom‚Äù capacity if I can stop having chronic pain once a month, but is it a valid proposition for a doctor? I‚Äôve had annoying experiences with gynaecologist all my life so consulting a new one makes me feel extremely anxious. 

I‚Äôve become increasingly isolated  and anxious since I‚Äôve had the space to start questioning me, cannot share with my family  ...any advice on that department?

601,2019-03-17 04:50:18,b21nqr,7,27,"Today was my transgender group meeting, which I have been having a lot of anxiety over due to my dysphoria.

We have a Facebook group, which, on one of my dysphoric days, I posted to about my  reluctantcy to attend group, as being the only nonbinary person to attend the group made me feel like an outcast. 

But this transgender woman saw the post, and messaged me begging me to come tonight, and I did. She smiled at me when she saw me at the meeting. I had an anxiety attack while everyone crowded in and talked and I found myself suffocating under my binder while my hands trembled. She still smiled at me across the room, and it made me feel a bit better.

My friend showed up to the meeting too, and sat beside me which meant a lot, as she hadn't been to the meetings in a while. A nice couple sat next to me, both of which had a calming aura and I eventually calmed down. The group was being especially warm to me, talking about nonbinary resources (without calling me out directly), and how they wanted to let everyone know they accepted nonbinary people (without calling me out) and praised some nonbinary people that they knew. I got teary eyed because I was so happy and touched.

I felt compelled to finally talk about what's been bothering me for months and they were so so supportive and I felt.... Okay. I felt safe for the first time in my skin there in a long time. I felt accepted. And safe.

After the meeting, the girl who begged me to come chased after me as I was leaving and pulled me to the side. She told me she was so incredibly happy that I came and that she wanted to let me know how she never wanted me to feel like I wasn't welcome and that I could always reach out to her. 

I just feel so touched and happy. 

This is the first time in a while I've felt this confident in my gender and have felt acceptance for myself. It feels pretty great. But it feels even better to know that I have friends who care so much about me.

Painting my nails or wearing a sparkly t-shirt does not make me less of a man or I stop being attracted to women or will make me be attracted to men.

For example, my girlfriend does not use make up or jewelry or sparkly shinny things or heels, and I'm no less physically attracted to her as a woman.

At the same time, sometimes I'd like to feel feminine and to do that I reach out to the same gender stereotypes I find ridiculous. Stockings, dresses, earings, manerisms. The more culturally feminine, the better.

I‚Äôm transmasculine pre-everything, but I‚Äôm very much non-binary and not interested in transitioning to binary male. However, I do want top surgery as soon as possible and I would like to go on T once I find out more about it. 

Some things I‚Äôm worried about are these: 
-if I go on a low dose of T to go slow and hopefully achieve androgyny, I‚Äôm worried my voice will sound helium-y or tinny or crackly forever. This would rly disappoint me as I like my voice and use it to sing 

-I‚Äôm worried that I will change too much in a short period of time and not have the chance to warn/come out to other members of my family besides my immediate. Specifically thinking of my really young siblings who know me as their sister 

-my dad took testosterone supplements for a while due to his low levels and he was very mean and angry during that time. I feel like I‚Äôm similar to my dad in a lot of ways and this is one thing I‚Äôm really scared about

640,2019-03-18 02:36:29,b2dc9c,9,20,"So I've known I was NB since I was 12. I started experiencing dysphoria around being seen as female around that time, but I didn't know that NB was a thing, so I just assumed I was a guy. In high school I started presenting more masc, and I was always happy when I got referred to as male - but in retrospect I think I was only happy because I wasn't being called ""female"".

Flash forward to now, on T and post-top, and I'm experiencing more social dysphoria than ever in my transition history. I've passed as male for years now, and...I'm uncomfortable. I'm not a guy. I hate being seen as male. It took a long time for me to become comfortable identifying as NB and I don't mean to whine, but it kinda just feels like my identity is getting stripped from me and I can't do anything about it.

I feel like it'd be pointless to come out as NB because I'm ""not really putting in effort"" to appear as anything but a binary male, for lack of a better explanation. I like my deep voice and want it to get deeper, I use he/him pronouns because I don't really like any other ones, I wear ""masc"" clothing, and I keep my beard. While these things can't be called inherently male, that's what any bystander would say, yeah? What good would people knowing I was NB do if everyone sees me as male, and hears me use male pronouns?

Anyway, I don't know where this is going anymore. Sometimes it just makes me feel upset that no matter how much presenting masculine makes me happy (and despite all my confusion over ""not female"" vs. ""male"", I love T and what it's doing for me), I'm always gonna have this social dysphoria on my back. I want to be out and proud. I love being NB. But it kinda feels like it wouldn't ""work"", so to speak.

I\'ve passed as male for years now, and...I\'m uncomfortable. I\'m not a guy. I hate being seen as male. It took a long time for me to become comfortable identifying as NB and I don\'t mean to whine, but it kinda just feels like my identity is getting stripped from me and I can\'t do anything about it.\n\nI feel like it\'d be pointless to come out as NB because I\'m ""not really putting in effort"" to appear as anything but a binary male, for lack of a better explanation.

I came out in and started my gender transition back in 2014. I jumped through all of the social, medical, and surgical hoops I aspired to jump through (including bottom surgery in 2016). And as I got to know myself as a trans woman over the years, I slowly realized, oh hey, my experience of womanhood is much more expansive and ambiguous and squiggly than I thought at the beginning. I went through a few rounds of thinking and talking about this with friends over the last \~ 18 months, but it wasn't until I created a nonbinary character for a tabletop rpg (this must be some kinda NB cliche, right?!) that I realized, OH, this does need to happen. 

So this past week, I started asking everyone in my life to use they/them for me primarily. And it feels great! A very different experience than my last coming out - much more focused and relaxed and comforting. 

I would like to read more about people who have gone through this kind of shift, specifically from binary-identified woman to nonbinary woman. It makes intuitive sense to me what's happening, but I'm realizing I am much more familiar with binary trans woman communities and conversations -- for instance, I would love to learn about other nonbinary trans women who pursued GRS, folks who have a kind of futchy/lowkey tomboy femme gender expression, etc. I guess there are other things I could say here/Feels to express, but I'll leave it at that for now.

hey ! this is my first ever reddit post so please let me know if i‚Äôve made any mistakes etc so i can fix them!! 

 so i‚Äôm 21, afab enby living in the uk with my partner of almost 3 years. for some background, i‚Äôve known i wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äògirl‚Äô since i was around 14 but only embarassingly recently found the terminology for what i felt. growing up i lived in a small town and didn‚Äôt have much exposure to the queer community (even though i did come out as pansexual while living there, my only real access to lgbtq+ peers was online) and now that i live in london i somehow feel even more isolated than i did then. 

most of my closest friends and family have semi-recently moved far away, and i only ever really see my partner now (because i barely leave the house anymore, yay depression). he‚Äôs very supportive, and is also not ‚Äòcompletely‚Äô cis or straight even though our relationship is cishet-appearing; even so, i feel extremely insecure about how our relationship will be viewed even once i come out to more people. 

 my identity still baffles me daily, as i acknowledge the fluidity but also have always leaned more towards wanting to present ‚Äòmasc‚Äô. lately i have felt more like a gay male hiding within a het-passing relationship, but i don‚Äôt know how to talk about this with my partner. obviously as i lean towards more and more masc then that is more likely to impact us as a unit whenever we leave the house, and i don‚Äôt know how much to emphasise that to him. 
he‚Äôs lovely and gentle and i‚Äôm so in love, but he sometimes would rather say nothing than risk coming off as a ‚Äòshitty man‚Äô by speaking on something he doesn‚Äôt experience. i can‚Äôt bear to hear ‚Äòthat makes sense‚Äô as a response when i‚Äôve just blurted out an essay on how and when i feel dysphoric, or how excited i am by the idea that one day i could save up for top surgery. 

i‚Äôm starting to feel the toll of this as i get increasingly frustrated and repressed within my own home, and i‚Äôve been taking it out on him by snapping at the littlest things and sometimes just being silent for ages at a time. i‚Äôve come out to my mum and several of my close (mostly cis) friends but i feel i have no real queer support network as of right now and am far too anxious to even know how to find one. 

  i hope its okay that i‚Äôm not looking for one super-specific piece of advice, and that this post is kind of a mess, i‚Äôm just feeling very alienated right now and if anything i‚Äôve said resonates with someone then i would really appreciate hearing what they have to say !!

660,2019-03-18 20:35:29,b2npvt,7,86,"I‚Äôm one of a few Classics majors at my school, and our Latin class only has eight students, so we get pretty close. I look pretty gay, and it doesn‚Äôt take much for even an older person to guess that I‚Äôm queer. Another student used she/her pronouns when referring to me, and the next time I came into my teachers office, she asked me what pronouns I used, asked how she could make me feel more comfortable, and said she would talk to the student. I said it wasn‚Äôt necessary, he hadn‚Äôt known, and I knew it wasn‚Äôt from a place of malice. I left feeling amazed, no other teacher had taken the time to make sure I felt comfortable and safe in their classroom. Later, we decided to give each other Roman names, and we all picked names from a hat, as well as our teacher picking a name for each of us.

'I glanced down and could tell that HE was wearing women's underwear and what was underneath it'  


Attorneys for a female Pennsylvania high school student filed a federal complaint last week alleging her privacy was violated and that she was subjected to sexual harassment when a transgender student was using the same locker room, WNEP-TV reported.

The Honesdale High School incident occurred at the beginning of this school year, according to the complaint filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Civil Rights Division, the station said.  


What allegedly happened?  
Lawyers for the student posted a video online describing what they say happened. The unnamed female student appears in the clip and said ""while I was putting on my pants I heard a man's voice, so I turned around, and he's standing there on the opposite aisle looking at me. I glanced down and could tell that he was wearing women's underwear and what was underneath it.""

She added: ""When I knew that a man was looking at me, I felt very violated and very scared ‚Äî especially looking at me while I'm getting dressed.""  


Attorney Andrea Shaw added in the video that ""opening up restrooms and locker rooms to members of the opposite sex is sexual harassment. Like most forms of sexual harassment, the girls in this school have little power over their situation. The school's only solution for my client was for her to wait outside the locker room until the individual of the opposite sex was finished changing, and then she went in and was late for gym class and also late for her second period class.""  


""The school's offered solution made it clear that they believed that my client was the problem,"" Shaw also said in the clip.

I will start T in a couple of months time. I feel a bit weird asking online, but in my country non-binary stuff are very new and usually people don't go on low dose, or stop for good, so there isn't much info between the doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm pretty much FTM, I just don't plan any surgery. Despite being short I'm very masculine in body shape, always been very active. I basically want the T changes, like deeper voice, more body hair, bottom growth but I don't want to be on T for life. I don't feel very good about the thought of stopping and getting ""softer"" but I will deal with it. I am ""fine"" with the monthly thing.

I know these listed changes come quite early, my ""plan"" is to be on T for a year or two. Mostly because I'm scared about getting health problems to that specific organ, when I have no intention to remove it. Children are not the reason, I just don't want to go in a hospital.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a bit lost, I don't know waht would be best for me from the health point of view and I know that the doctor won't know either.

I am wondering if there is any point in going low dose. It literally frustrates me looking at low dose timelines, because I do want the changes to come asap. I am considering it, wondeing if that's actually easier for the body.

723,2019-03-20 22:35:48,b3ijdb,9,17,"So for 30 years, I've been a girl. I started thinking about this recently, though, sort of looking back on teenagers and teen culture and how these things have changed since I was a part of them. Teenagers tend to grasp for labels with ever-increasing granularity, because that's the time when you're figuring out what sort of adult you're about to be any minute now. When I was a teen, the thing (at least on the internet) seemed to be the presence, or lack thereof, of some greater spiritual being. Are you a deist or a nontheist, or a strong or weak atheist, or a strong or weak agnostic, and so on and so on. Today's equivalent seems to be staking out your place on the spectrum of gender and sexuality. So I asked myself, if I had grown up now instead of in the '90s and early '00s, taking quizzes about what my REAL TRUE gender/sexuality is instead of what flavor of nontheist I am, agonizing about this instead of that, what would I have chosen? Currently, at least until like right now, I've always identified as a straight ciswoman. But it's really more complicated than that, as soon as I start to think about it more than not at all. 

I have no interest in other women sexually, but I've had a close nigh-romantic friendship with one for the last 15 years. Like, we are partners in basically every way that matters and sometimes I want to hold her hand and bring her flowers, but she doesn't like handholding or flowers so we don't do that. I have romantic and sexual feelings about men, and I have a definitely masculine boyfriend that I love and fuck. So I guess that's biromantic heterosexual, which is near enough to ""straight"" that there's really no functional difference for me, since I'm someone who prefers the sex come with romance every time. Easy enough, there's that identity sorted.

As far as gender goes, I really didn't ""get"" transpeople at all for a long time. I've always been supportive nonetheless, because as a ciswoman, obviously I wouldn't ""get"" it, would I? I have the pretty normal childhood story of being tomboyish but not athletic, liking nerd shit that's ""boy things"", having no interest in normal ""girl things"" like dolls and makeup. Any pride I had in being a girl was that cringey-in-retrospect ""not like other girls"" kind of thing. I've never experienced wanting to be a boy, just frustration when people have tried to criticize me for being not feminine enough, or for liking ""boy things"". I didn't get why a person wouldn't just be a masculine woman or a feminine man. After all, I'm a girl and I can wear whatever I want, so why can't a dude wear a dress? I didn't get why I didn't ""get"" it until I saw Vihart's On Gender video a few years ago. Oh, I just don't relate because I don't have strong feelings about being a girl. Or any feelings, literally at all. If I woke up tomorrow and I were physically male, the only feeling I would have would be annoyed at the inconvenience of my clothes not fitting. I don't have euphoria, or dysphoria, or anything, I just nothing the idea. I'm a girl essentially by default. So if I were a teen now, I'd probably identify as nonbinary. 

BUT WAIT A MINUTE. This thought experiment is about how I would identify if I were hypothetically growing up now, but it's based on things that are literally true. I would hypothetically identify as nonbinary because the definition applies to me... which makes me nonbinary, literally actually now. 

The problem, I guess, is that I don't know what to do with this information, if anything. I don't care what pronouns people use for me. I like my clothes. I'm fine with my body. This would have no impact on my friendships or relationships or work or anything at all, unless I decided to enforce they/them, which just seems like so much work for something I don't care about.

After speaking with my therapist last night, we both agreed that I need to start seriously exploring my gender identity and sexuality in a less traditional way. I'm in my late 20's and living in the Midwest, so there's isn't exactly a flourishing community of nonbinary folks to talk to, so I figured this would be a good place to start. ^(Ok so there are a few places but I'm a socially anxious turdwagon and I need to ease into this.)

I've tried explaining (binary) trans people to them many many times and they just can't wrap their head around it, or maybe they just don't want to. I don't know how I could ever get them to grasp what it means that I'm nonbinary. they would never kick me out or anything like that, so I recognise I'm really privileged to even be in such a secure situation, but they're also the only people I get to interact with 95% of the time, so if something (i.e. me coming out) was to make our relationship awkward or tense I would have no escape and I would feel even more isolated than I already do. I am going to come out, I'm just terrified to do it. and I don't know how I could possibly explain to them why I'd want to go on T, I'm really not sure they would support that decision and the idea of going through the changes of T in front of them knowing they hate that I've made that decision makes me feel sick. plus I'd almost definitely have to go private to get T (I'm in the UK) because I'm housebound and couldn't travel to a gender identity clinic, and I don't have any income of my own so I'd be relying on them to help out with that which complicates it all even further.

it wasn't so bad when I wasn't sure if T was something I wanted, but now I'm sure about it I'm a bit broken up over it.

I was sitting with a teacher during indoor recess in kindergarten. I don't remember why this conversation was happening or how it started, but we were talking about colors.
""There are boy colors and girl colors."" I am paraphrasing, of course. I do not remember word for word what I had said so long ago. 
""Which colors are boy colors and which are girl colors?"" My teacher asked. 
I listed them off. Boys got blue and green and orange. Girls got pink and red and yellow.
""What about Noah?"" My teacher nodded towards another kid who was playing nearby. "" He's wearing red, but he's a boy."" 
A shook my head like what she said was silly. ""Boys can wear girl colors and girls can wear boy colors,"" I said. 
""Why?""
""Because they're just colors.""
""Then why are some for boys and some for girls?""
""They just are!""
""Why?"" 
""I don't know."" 
I don't think my kindergarten teacher was trying to make me tear apart and dissect the societal constructs of gender roles and expectations.

I was barely social yet, let alone aware of social constructs. But I remember feeling really odd as a little kid, despite forgetting the whole conversation a few minutes later, not to resurface until I was much, much older. 
Not sure what the point of this was. Just thought I'd share. Kids are learning the world. In some ways, they understand it better than any adult does. They see what is there in front of them instead of what others want us to. I try to look at society through the lens of a child when I can. It helps you realize how many ""controversial"" things are founded on nonsense, or on some abstract form of power. All I care about is how I feel in my own skin, how I can make others feel, and how much good I can out into the world.

Alright so, we don't (yet) fully understand what consciousness is, but hear me out.

Currently, I identify as Agender. To me, my consciousness (the awareness that I am alive, my thoughts, ect) is, for the most part, what I view to be ""me"". It is a self-awareness that is separate from my physical form. I suppose my brain is AG, physically speaking, because that is the sex that I was assigned at birth. But my thoughts aren't AG thoughts, are they? AG thinking process maybe, but not AG thoughts.

Thoughts and emotions are not all that we are yes, but neither is our physical form, whatever that form may be.

Personally, I see my body as a vessel for interacting with the world. It's still important to me, because without it I would lose my ability to be conscious and experience life. But it does not, on it's own, encapsulate who I am to myself, or to anyone else.

That being said, our physical forms still affect how we perceive ourselves. For example, Trans people (Hey! :) ) exist because they have an observable *physical* brain structure that does not match with their physical sex. I am not Trans, nor do I experience physical dysphoria, but I'm sure that one can imagine how uncomfortable this must be for them. I know that would be almost unbearable for me to feel forever trapped in a body that does not feel like it belongs to me.

I've spent a good long while trying to figure out what I am, and how I want to present myself outwardly to others. But I realized that, *who* you are may be more important. Your actions and presence say more about you than any article of clothing or outward appearance. 

I do not have all the answers. Heck, I may not have any. But what I know is that you are alive. I am alive. One day, we won't be. But for now, we are all connected in the sense that we are all experiencing what it is to exist in this world, as a human being. And guess what babe?

*You are the only person in this world to exist, right now, exactly as you are.*

TL;DR: Whoever you are, you're pretty cool.

I keep flipping back and forth between wanting full top surgery and a reduction. 

I generally present in a masc of center way, but don't necessarily want to fully present as male. I currently wear a binder most of the time, but that can only do so much, and I want to feel better on the clothes that I choose.

The tricky part about getting full top surgery is that both my wife and my mum don't want me to get it, I don't know if it's something that I want but it's hard to get a clear picture of what I want because I'm also worried about upsetting them.

On the one hand, a reduction would give me more freedom to choose to presently more feminine if I feel like it. It would also be less to get me head around - I don't know if would still feel like me with no boobs at all. Another 'for' in the reduction column is that I have an hourglass figure and might look unbalanced with nothing up top.

On the other hand, reductions can only go so small (like a D/C at most), so I would still be binding most of the time to feel comfortable in my clothes. And if I'm doing that, why not go for full top so I don't have to wear a binder or bra at all?

I see Dr. Kathy Rumer for a surgical consultation soon, and I'm really afraid to tell people this...

Basically, I identify as non-binary. I am AMAB, but I present as a man, wear men's clothing, etc.

But, like, my genitalia really bother me, alot. Also, I often fantasize what it would be like to have a vagina and to have sex with it. I have a boyfriend and I've told him, and he's perfectly cool with it, but I'm afraid like that I won't be able to get this procedure. If I do get a vaginoplasty, I plan to go on testosterone after. I guess I just look at trans men all the time and wish I was them...

But at this point, I don't know if I can keep doing this. He doesn't like, and is very unaffectionate, when I bind or appear more masc. It's gotten the point where he gets unaffectionate and uncomfortable when I correct OTHER PEOPLE'S uses of my pronouns, even though I haven't corrected him once.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi folks, yet-unnamed afab nb (masc of centre) child here. I've been trying to choose a new name, since my birth name is heavily gendered and has some rather unfortunate associations for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I've narrowed it down from a list of about 100 to 20 to a shortlist of 4 and I'm now really struggling to choose between them, so I thought I'd get some advice from you folks!

&amp;#x200B;

So far my list is as follows: Elis, Linden, Robin, and Elian (seems like I really have a thing for those -n names eh...)

&amp;#x200B;

Some of my scattered thoughts:

* Linden is a lovely name except I'm from Vancouver and Trevor Linden is one of our super respected and famous hockey players, and I don't really want people to make that association
* Robin is great fun to write since my capital R is the best-looking letter in my handwriting
* Elis with one l? Ellis with two? who knows, language is fake
* Elian kinda sounds like hellion the way I intuitively pronounce it, not sure how many people would make that connection buuut I'm thinking of playing around with the pronunciation just because of that

Hey, guys, gals &amp; nonbinary pals! Derry here, the DM of the Dice Will Roll podcast, here with a new episode of our show! We're a group of 4 LGBT friends- an Irish Pan Animator, a Trans Latino Artist, an Enby Californian Theater Kid and a Filipino Bi Graphic Designer, who've been friends for years and playing DnD for a lot of that time- specifically, Pathfinder, a spinoff system with expanded options and rules! When the Playtest for a Second Edition of Pathfinder was announced for the system, we couldn't help but jump right into a brand new campaign and test out the rules. And what better way to start us off than the legendary KINGMAKER campaign, a sprawling adventure through the wilds with the goal of raising a kingdom run by the players! So legendary, in fact, it's inspired a video game, which has an amazing soundtrack including pieces by Inon Zur of Dragon Age- featured in our show, with permission from the Devs! Without further ado, we hope you enjoy the show! If you do, make sure to tell a friend, leave an iTunes Review, subscribe to our feed or support us on Patreon! And just to get you hooked, here's a teaser for our latest episode: Fables &amp; Fey!

*Our explorers of the Stolen Lands are on the hunt: they're looking for the monstrous Tatzylwyrm, a snake-like dragon which is rumoured to lurk along the rivers of the Greenbelt! However, as per usual, stuff gets in the way- some tricksters toy with them, they tell each other their pasts, and become closer as friends! But can the power of friendship prepare them for the ghastly discovery that waits in the clearing..? Who's to say? Maybe it will, maybe it won't! It all depends on how the dice roll!*

*Stories get woven. Monsters get hunted. Dread creeps through souls. All this and more in this episode of ¬†Dice Will Roll, the Gayest Pathfinder Podcast on the Planet, where we ask the hard questions like... how do I get these annoying invisible pranksters to leave me alone?*

ramble about gender because sometimes I get a bit insecure about being an Enby :) so grab a drink and pull up your pants because you can't push up pants.

*This is just my take on things, you don't have to agree, regardless I'm up for civil discussion on this, because I love hearing other people's perspectives.*

Anyways, you are not your gender.

Yes, you have a biological sex, (male or female).

Yes, you have an assigned gender based on that biological sex, (man or woman).

Yes, you have a balance of hormones in your body that affect your thought processes and physical appearance (testosterone and estrogen).

But none of those matter when it comes to *gender Identity/Expression*

Your assigned gender is there. Your sex is there. But you do not have to accept or deny either.

If you do not connect with your body, if you do not connect with words used to address you socially, if you mentally do not connect to your assigned gender, or if you are like me do not understand ""gender"" in general, that is okay. If you identify as NB for another reason, that's cool too. I feel like it's a lot more normal than a lot of people admit. So long as there is nothing harming you, and that you are getting help for unpleasant feelings associated with dysphoria, or unpleasant feelings in general, you, as a human, have the freedom to express your gender (or lack of connection to said gender) however you wish. 

I'm tired of people being unnecessarily rude or even hateful because they are confused/frustrated that they cannot understand that we do not identify as ""Man"" or ""Woman"" or ""Boy"" or ""Girl"".

I am not rejecting my gender. I'm not replacing it with a different wacky new ""third gender"". I am *expressing* (Through language, physical appearance, mannerisms, ect) that I feel no strong connection to my assigned gender, that I have no desire to connect with my assigned gender, and that living this way is way helps me somewhat soothe the conflict between my mind and body.

*However you identify, like everyone else, you're still a human who deserves politeness and a fair amount of basic respect. We are all multi-dimensional beings, and despite what some people would say, not any amount of words that will sum up the entirety of who we are*

What determines who we are is our actions and character. That's it. You keep doing you.

953,2019-03-27 03:53:24,b5zoa0,6,40,"So, I‚Äôve never actually looked up what the clinical definition of gender dysphoria is or what symptoms qualify someone for a diagnosis.

But since truscum like to use the concept as a basis for whether they offer basic respect to someone or not, I was inspired by some conversation in /r/ennn to do a little reading. This post is basically what I commented over there with more added at the end.

The DSM-5 lists six symptoms of gender dysphoria and at least **two** must be met for diagnosis *and* it must cause ‚Äúclinically significant distress or impairment.‚Äù 

**Three symptoms involve a desire or feeling of being a gender or to be treated like a gender other than one‚Äôs assigned gender without any mention of how the person feels about their sex characteristics.** So the experience of gender dysphoria does not necessarily have to have anything to do with body parts.

As for the clinically significant bit, well, I have an anecdote.

When I was nervous about diagnostic testing for ADHD, my therapist basically told me **a diagnosis is just a tool for treatment. Not meeting the criteria for a diagnosis doesn‚Äôt make your issues less real or mean you‚Äôve been faking whatever caused you to seek a diagnosis in the first place. It doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt still seek to solve whatever those issues are.**

The concept/diagnosis of gender dysphoria is primarily a tool used to treat patients who are suffering, whose lives are being significantly disrupted, whose quality of life can improve through treatment. 

The absence of clinically significant gender dysphoria doesn‚Äôt suddenly invalidate a trans person‚Äôs transness or give people license to misgender anyone. It doesn‚Äôt make anyone‚Äôs identity less real. 

It means that their needs for living and functioning as their gender can probably be met without professional/medical intervention.

**A diagnosis is not an identity**. It might help someone clarify or work out their identity, it might play a huge role in someone‚Äôs identity, it might help shape how someone relates to themselves and to the world, but it‚Äôs not a definition of a person.

[The APA itself](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) when explaining the treatment for gender dysphoria, acknowledges that adults may only need support in being treated as their gender without additional medical treatment or altering their bodies. 

**The APA actually broadly defines gender dysphoria as discontent with one‚Äôs AGAB and says that it‚Äôs just more specifically defined when using it as a diagnostic tool.**

While I don‚Äôt think any of this is going to convince any truscum to suddenly start accepting us or any trans identified person who doesn‚Äôt experience physical related dysphoria (and I want to acknowledge that not all of us are even comfortable self identifying as trans and that‚Äôs okay, I hope this post still has helpful info for you or at least arms you to better support the people who do) but I know I felt some validation looking into all this and wanted to share.

You still deserve to have your identity, pronouns, and experiences respected.",NonBinary,Gender Dysphoria,1553684004.0,"{'created_utc': 1553658804, 'id': 'b5zoa0', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 40, 'selftext': 'So, I‚Äôve never actually looked up what the clinical definition of gender dysphoria is or what symptoms qualify someone for a diagnosis.\n\nBut since truscum like to use the concept as a basis for whether they offer basic respect to someone or not, I was inspired by some conversation in /r/ennn to do a little reading. This post is basically what I commented over there with more added at the end.\n\nThe DSM-5 lists six symptoms of gender dysphoria and at least **two** must be met for diagnosis *and* it must cause ‚Äúclinically significant distress or impairment.‚Äù \n\n**Three symptoms involve a desire or feeling of being a gender or to be treated like a gender other than one‚Äôs assigned gender without any mention of how the person feels about their sex characteristics.** So the experience of gender dysphoria does not necessarily have to have anything to do with body parts.\n\nAs for the clinically significant bit, well, I have an anecdote.\n\nWhen I was nervous about diagnostic testing for ADHD, my therapist basically told me **a diagnosis is just a tool for treatment. Not meeting the criteria for a diagnosis doesn‚Äôt make your issues less real or mean you‚Äôve been faking whatever caused you to seek a diagnosis in the first place. It doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt still seek to solve whatever those issues are.**\n\nThe concept/diagnosis of gender dysphoria is primarily a tool used to treat patients who are suffering, whose lives are being significantly disrupted, whose quality of life can improve through treatment. \n\nThe absence of clinically significant gender dysphoria doesn‚Äôt suddenly invalidate a trans person‚Äôs transness or give people license to misgender anyone. It doesn‚Äôt make anyone‚Äôs identity less real. \n\nIt means that their needs for living and functioning as their gender can probably be met without professional/medical intervention.\n\n**A diagnosis is not an identity**. It might help someone clarify or work out their identity, it might play a huge role in someone‚Äôs identity, it might help shape how someone relates to themselves and to the world, but it‚Äôs not a definition of a person.\n\n[The APA itself](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria) when explaining the treatment for gender dysphoria, acknowledges that adults may only need support in being treated as their gender without additional medical treatment or altering their bodies. \n\n**The APA actually broadly defines gender dysphoria as discontent with one‚Äôs AGAB and says that it‚Äôs just more specifically defined when using it as a diagnostic tool.**\n\nWhile I don‚Äôt think any of this is going to convince any truscum to suddenly start accepting us or any trans identified person who doesn‚Äôt experience physical related dysphoria (and I want to acknowledge that not all of us are even comfortable self identifying as trans and that‚Äôs okay, I hope this post still has helpful info for you or at least arms you to better support the people who do) but I know I felt some validation looking into all this and wanted to share.\n\n**tl;dr** Not wanting to be identified as your AGAB counts as gender dysphoria and you should never ever let anyone make you doubt your identity if you don‚Äôt need or want hormones or surgeries.

a friend and i decided to visit one of the science museums in my city and check out an exhibit she‚Äôs been interested in. it seemed like a bad time, since the museum is known as a popular destination for kids and families and my state‚Äôs schools (meaning our university and most public schools) are on spring break this week. still, we decided the brave the masses of children to find something to do on a wednesday afternoon.

in the time that we were there several kids came up to me and explained things to me or asked me to help out, which i‚Äôm used to‚Äî i work with kids often enough that i knew what to do. at one point as my friend and i were looking at one of the experiments they had out, though, i heard a quite voice behind me go, ‚Äúexcuse me, miss?‚Äù

i turned around (even though i don‚Äôt normally respond to miss?) to see a kid who looked to be about middle school age, who immediately asked, ‚Äúwhat does your they/them pin mean?‚Äù

i was carrying the backpack i use at school today. it has several enamel pins on the inner part and a large-ish pin with my pronouns (as shown in the link above). i do this so that other folks can see it and hopefully they‚Äôll address me correctly. my school my home city are pretty inclusive, so i feel comfortable doing this. 

i was a little surprised but was able to explain that it means that i want people to use they/them as pronouns when they refer to me. as i was about to explain further i saw this kid‚Äôs face light up and they immediately declared, ‚Äúi use they/them pronouns too! it‚Äôs so cool to find one of my people!‚Äù 

we didn‚Äôt talk for very long, but they ended up telling me that they were in junior high (i tried to make it clear that i‚Äôm 20 and an actual adult so that they didn‚Äôt try to be friends more than that), that they had come out to their grandfather who seemed accepting, and that their father thought the nonbinary flag was for a school club or something. they seemed excited when i confirmed that i identify as nonbinary, too. 

they asked to take a selfie with me (i said yes, of course, and i‚Äôm sure it was cheesy and terrible) then went on their way. it was really nice and cool to see a younger teen so proud of their identity, and to be that kind of older, probably more ‚Äúout‚Äù type of person that i was always excited to meet. idk if they‚Äôre on here at all, but if they are i hope they see it and hope they had a good day at the museum!",NonBinary,a kid stopped me to ask what the button on my bag meant.,1553763296.0,"{'created_utc': 1553738096, 'id': 'b6cz5y', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 27, 'selftext': 'here‚Äôs a [link](https://m.imgur.com/a/sWHxBlt) to a pic of my button, on my backpack. apologies for this being a link and for any other weirdness because of mobile. \n\nanyways. \n\na friend and i decided to visit one of the science museums in my city and check out an exhibit she‚Äôs been interested in. it seemed like a bad time, since the museum is known as a popular destination for kids and families and my state‚Äôs schools (meaning our university and most public schools) are on spring break this week. still, we decided the brave the masses of children to find something to do on a wednesday afternoon.\n\nin the time that we were there several kids came up to me and explained things to me or asked me to help out, which i‚Äôm used to‚Äî i work with kids often enough that i knew what to do. at one point as my friend and i were looking at one of the experiments they had out, though, i heard a quite voice behind me go, ‚Äúexcuse me, miss?‚Äù\n\ni turned around (even though i don‚Äôt normally respond to miss?) to see a kid who looked to be about middle school age, who immediately asked, ‚Äúwhat does your they/them pin mean?‚Äù\n\ni was carrying the backpack i use at school today. it has several enamel pins on the inner part and a large-ish pin with my pronouns (as shown in the link above). i do this so that other folks can see it and hopefully they‚Äôll address me correctly. my school my home city are pretty inclusive, so i feel comfortable doing this. \n\ni was a little surprised but was able to explain that it means that i want people to use they/them as pronouns when they refer to me. as i was about to explain further i saw this kid‚Äôs face light up and they immediately declared, ‚Äúi use they/them pronouns too! it‚Äôs so cool to find one of my people!‚Äù \n\nwe didn‚Äôt talk for very long, but they ended up telling me that they were in junior high (i tried to make it clear that i‚Äôm 20 and an actual adult so that they didn‚Äôt try to be friends more than that), that they had come out to their grandfather who seemed accepting, and that their father thought the nonbinary flag was for a school club or something. they seemed excited when i confirmed that i identify as nonbinary, too. \n\nthey asked to take a selfie with me (i said yes, of course, and i‚Äôm sure it was cheesy and terrible) then went on their way. it was really nice and cool to see a younger teen so proud of their identity, and to be that kind of older, probably more ‚Äúout‚Äù type of person that i was always excited to meet. idk if they‚Äôre on here at all, but if they are i hope they see it and hope they had a good day at the museum!', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'a kid stopped me to ask what the button on my bag meant.', 'created': 1553763296.0}"

1015,2019-03-28 21:33:32,b6onsc,1,2,"This is called *Partner, A Being.*

I heard a poem from the teacher at the assembly today. 
All about how our electronics and smart devices are making us detached from being human, from feeling human.
‚ÄúWhere sweet private whispers become public.‚Äù
And it makes me think back. Back to the weekend I spent with my partner.
A weekend of amazing food and tea that I haven‚Äôt had before.
Of going to shows at their school and being caught up in the energy.
And every time we went out of the house, they dressed me up in another outfit.
And I felt amazing.
I felt my true self come out in those outfits.
The crop tops, the boyfriend jeans, the makeup, and a David Bowie lightning bolt that they drew on my face.
And I loved every second of it.
And I thought to myself, 
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And during the intermission and after the show, they introduced me to their friends, and they welcomed me with open arms, despite the fact that I don‚Äôt go to the same school. 
I felt legitimate gender euphoria, where all the bad thoughts could just fade away, and I could be my natural feminine self.
And I thought to myself,
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And when we got back to their house, and we snuggled up together on the sofa and watched Queer Eye or She-Ra all blown up on the big TV, and I felt as if I could die right then and there, and I would still be happy. 
And I thought to myself,
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And after a fairly big dinner, we stepped into a bubble bath full of rose petals, and they held me in between their legs as we washed with a special soap from Lush shaped like a heart, and everything felt so ethereal and full of love, and I asked myself,
‚ÄúIs this what it‚Äôs like to feel human?‚Äù
And by the time we were dry at midnight, and their parents had gone to sleep, and we went into their bed. 
And we cuddled.
They held my legs in theirs, and they pressed my body close to theirs, and they left a warm, passionate kiss on my forehead.
I kissed back, and then we were united. 
I could almost see myself outside my own body.
Two beings, lovers, intertwined, stripped of clothes and garments, pressed together into one. I felt peace. I felt at home. 
I felt my body fade and melt away, and I was only an essence, being held like a koala against the warm figure of my partner. 
I faded into pure love then, and everything was clouded under metaphysical pinks and blues. 
They brought me back into reality, touching and caressing me.
They brought my body into theirs, and they made me to use their chest as a pillow. 
And although they told me about wanting a reduction, they enjoyed the moments we had, and how we made each other happy.
I was in bliss.
We cuddled like koalas until we fell asleep, our phones only distant whispers.

Confusing right?

Example:
Man speaking to female dog: 'who's a good girl? Yes you are. Yes dad,yes. So cute. Come sit with your dad. '
Man speaking to male dog: 'who's a good boy? Yes you are. Yes dad,yes. So cute. Come sit with your dad. '

Woman speaking to female dog: ''who's a good girl? Yes you are. Yes mom,yes. So cute. Come sit with your mom. '
Woman speaking to male dog: ''who's a good mom? Yes you are. Yes mom,yes. So cute. Come sit with your mom. '

It sounds so weird in english. But we literally speak for the dogs to ourselves. 
I'd tell my husband (as if the dog is talking, while cuddling the dog, both of us looking at the dog the entire time, in excited voice as always ehen talking to a dog): 'hello dad, guess what I did today. Yes. That's right. I put on a new sweater. Yes. Mom helped'

Everyone does this. It's normal. I swear. 

I was talking for/to my dog the other night and just got hit in the face with a wave of dysphoria. 
I dont not want to call myself mom. It does bot feel good at all. 

Ideas for a neutral word? It's a dog, so it doesn't have to seem appropriate to children or other people or anything. I just want to have a nice chat with/for/through my dog.

I've been questioning my gender (again) recently. I first started as cis female years ago, then I went through a bunch of nonbinary identities, and then I thought I was a trans male for like 2 years. Spoiler alert, I wasn't. I found that out when my mental health deteriorated veeeery quickly IDing as a guy.

Since then, I went back to cis female. I hated everything masculine.

Woman and lady and other female terms don't feel right. I'm okay with girl, but only from my boyfriend.

Problem is, I'm okay with she/her. I have absolutely no problem with it. I'm also very happy with they/them. I wouldn't say I prefer one over the other, but right now I'm using they/them online and she/her irl and it's a nice balance. I feel like both she/her and they/them combined capture my identity and personal sense of being very well. What my exact identity is, I'm not sure, but yeah.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey all,

&amp;#x200B;

I've been lurking for a few months now, and I am really happy to finally make this post. Seeing so much support from this sub has made me feel so much braver. After many years of questioning and fear, I've finally accepted that I'm almost certainly agender, and that nonbinary feels right to me.

I have the classic story of growing up a tomboy, although as I entered middle school I became more comfortable with femininity. Then, in my freshman year, I was blindsided by the desire to cut my hair and present highly masculine. During that time, I went by he/him online but never came out to anyone. I also lost most of my friends that year, and after it ended, I mistakenly thought it was because of my gender expression and began to dress more femininely again. I entered a toxic and harmful relationship for my sophomore and junior years, where I grew my hair long and acted exclusively feminine for that period of time at his request. He told me near the end that if I cut my hair again, no one would ever love me or think I was attractive, and that I would never be androgynous no matter what I do. In the moment, it seemed terrifying, but I cut my hair despite what he said and finally managed to escape from that relationship. Also, jokes on him, because I realized his words were just a last-ditch effort and weren't actually true! (androgyny ftw whip and dab)

I spent the summer after junior year healing, chilling, and getting back into presenting how I want to. In the fall of my senior year, I met my current datefriend and the most wonderful person I know. After not having close friends since the start of high school, they introduced me to their group of very gay and very good friends, and we've helped each other both explore our gender identities. The rest of senior year up till now has been filled with a lot of reflection, support, and happiness from the little community that seemed to spring up around me overnight last fall.

This sub has also worked wonders for my anxieties about gender that have kind of been looming over me my whole life, as I look back. I've done a lot of thinking, and the fact that I could always visit this sub for some positivity has been incredible. (Basically, if you've posted in this sub for the last like several months, I definitely saw your post/selfie and loved it!!!) Especially amid a lot of the truscum/transmed conversations on social media, a lot of the time I began to feel confused and invalid. This sub has always been there in those moments, and helped me realize I can be as masculine, feminine, or androgynous as I like! With all you folks' help, I've finally accepted that nonbinary fits me. Additionally, agender also feels right, as some of the things I learned from my self-reflection included that I think of myself moreso as an entity than a girl (I know that description could apply to other identities but agender seems to sum it up well for me).

There's a lot more work for me to do as I learn about my identity, but I wanted to share my story and thank you all so so much for everything you've done for me. Oh jeez this is emotional huh. I'm definitely not crying right now for sure. With your support, I came out to my small group of friends, which isn't much, but it's a start. Thank you for providing such a supportive and accepting space, because you've given me the gift of a place I could explore who I am without judgement. Happy TDOV.

I have identified as nonbinary for about three years and I have been coming out to more people slowly but surely. I was recently accepted into a graduate position in the conservation science field. This field is typically male-dominated but I'm working closely with three seemingly ""liberal"" females. I am not very close to my new advisor yet and we haven't had much time to talk just the two of us, so I am not sure where she stands on some things.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, at the heart of the matter I use they/them pronouns but I accept she/her. For my official grad student bio I purposely used they/them pronouns as it felt more comfortable and was a huge step for me. Of course I submitted this without expressly stating this to my advisor. I found out today that she updated her website to add me in, but my bio was changed to she/her pronouns. 

&amp;#x200B;

I probably wouldn't feel so upset had I not made the purposeful decision to use my preferred pronouns and they were changed without anyone asking me. Like I said, I don't necessarily mind she/her but I didn't write my bio with them. 

&amp;#x200B;

My next meeting with my advisor is in two weeks with another cohort member and a member from an environmental agency who is a mentor on this project. Do I address this issue with all of them at this meeting? Do I send my advisor an email or wait for some time alone? Or do I just deal with it since I do accept she/her pronouns?

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice/opinions/anything would help. I'm just sad today.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

A little about me. I'm a 30-something guy, a good career,a normal relationship. No debt. Life is great, right. What's my problem? I don't feel like I'm living the right life. Through my teens, I never quite felt like a guy. I've always hated having body hair or participating in typical guy hobbies. I've always loved poetry, arts, emotional sappy music and movies, and so forth.  Used to closed door crossdress out of curiosity. Looking back I always felt super comfortable in women clothes. Not in a fetish way, but more in a relax around home thing. Unfortunately, god has a sense of humor and made me 6 foot tall, hairy from head to toe, wide shoulders and manly physique. Needless to say, I always hated looking at myself in a mirror. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for relationships, I've always been very attracted to femininity. Nothing about the male body does a thing for me. So I've almost exclusively dated women. Except... Yeah, hang on tight... One time I met a very feminine guy. He would wear very feminine clothes, clean shave what little hair he had, wore a little makeup and had cute hair. That was one of the most fulfilling relationships I've ever had. Even though it didn't work out, I learned a lot about myself. I enjoyed playing a feminine role, as well as the male role. I enjoyed his male genitalia as much as I enjoyed women's, and at times was definitely more comfortable with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make me Trans? Not exactly. But, somewhere, something awoke inside of me that I just can't put a finger on. My therapist doesn't really give me any insight and says it's a phase. So far, that's been a two decade phase! I hate looking at myself in the mirror. No matter how fit, thin, or attractive I feel, every day is a struggle to just feel ""normal"". Almost like I am living my life through the eyes of someone else. My current relationship is good, but she doesn't support my feminine side at all. So, I'm constantly suppressing that feeling and burying that desire. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice any one could give me? Maybe a book to read, or something to watch, so I can enlighten my life? I feel like the answers are all right in front of me, but I just can't figure out the right question to ask.

That was myself.

I am a dumbass.

Leave my sensibilities

unmolested, you witch

Dancing through my memories

as if you belonged all along.

-

You flit from scene to sacred scene

with out an answer to give

-

Drawing questions from the peace

hard purchased with pain and patience

-

And every night you take a dream

to entangle with a wish

-

waking me with my wanting

and absence rich as rum.

-

At times, I'd like to take your hand

and whisk you back to living eyes

-

But with your teasing, you lead me on

to see the patterns in living Earth

I cannot alone define.

If someone is trans gender they are transitioning from their assigned gender to some other place on our outside of the gender spectrum, this may include hormones or surgery, or different clothing /makeup that is less associated with their assigned gender as far as I've seen.

If someone wants to be healthy, they might take steps to eat or exercise to obtain the state of healthiness illustrated by doctors.

*TLDR: How does ""Allyson May James"" sound as a name? I'm normal; treat me normal.   
**Okay, first the name thing**   
I've been thinking a lot about names, and i think I've narrowed down to one, i just want to know how it sounds to other people   
&gt;Allyson May James   
I wasn't born in may, i just liked the sound of it as a middle name, though i don't normally use my middle name.   
No worry about my full name being on the interwebs, I haven't used that name for anything yet, so you'd never find my with it.

---

**Next is my insight about being trans**   
* 1) transgender vs transsexual vs transvestite   
my own definitions are mostly based on the root words,   
trans meaning to go from one to another.   

-gender meaning the social constructed categories of gender, masculine/feminine. so being transgender would mean that you go from one gender to another, like a larger change, going from 80% masculine to 80% feminine (basically what i have done.)    

-sexual meaning the sex of the person, ie: male/female   
typically sex is determined by the chromosomes, as well as the combination of hormones and reproductive organelle , and other physical characteristics   

-transvestite meaning to present as the apposing gender, clothing etc. without desire to transition medically or social and retaining your default gender identity

For me, I am transgender and transsexual. I identify as feminine woman, and am also partaking in medical transition

* 2) For me personally, i don't tell people that I'm trans because they usually treat me different after being told/learning about me.   
Not usually in a bad way, like derogatory behavior. They just treat me like I'm a sensitive baby, when i just want to be treated like a person.   

also for me, i'm not actually proud to be trans. i don't identify as a transwoman, i just identify as a woman/female. nothing different or special. i don't need a safe space in the college library if someone missgenders me, i just correct them and move on, the same that any cis person would do.

They just treat me like I\'m a sensitive baby, when i just want to be treated like a person.   \n\nalso for me, i\'m not actually proud to be trans. i don\'t identify as a transwoman, i just identify as a woman/female. nothing different or special. i don\'t need a safe space in the college library if someone missgenders me, i just correct them and move on, the same that any cis person would do.\n\n---\n\nokay, this was a little messy, but i think it\'s mostly comprehensible.   \n\nI\'m a bit stoned so if something doesn\'t make sense, tell me; I\'ll try to reword it better.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'two things, one a name question, the other is my personal insight', 'created': 1551530768.0}"

We've been best friends since before he told me he was trans so I'm not completely used to calling him ""he"". He hasn't started taking T yet.

Of course I said yes because I've been extra gay for him since we started hanging out. I have a few concerns though:

&gt;I've heard that taking T can make your hormones crazy and cause mood swings and anxiety and stuff like that, some even describe it as traumatizing. I want to support him if it's difficult so if anybody has advice I'd love it.

&gt;I thought I was a lesbian but I decided that I love him for his personality so I don't care that he wants to me a man. Does that mean I'm pansexual?

&gt;Do you think he cares that I'm taller than him? I obviously can't help it but I don't want him to be upset that his girlfriend is 5'8"" and he's 5'2"". 

&gt;How do I tell my family that he's trans? They still call him ""Angie"" and think he's a girl because I haven't told them. I know my sister won't care but my parents are pretty judgemental and make cruel jokes about trans people sometimes. 

&gt;How can I help him with his own family? His mother is abusive and tells him he'll always be a girl and that he's insane. It makes me so sad that he has to endure that every day. My mom is abusive too but it isn't the same, so I can't understand completely.

76,2019-03-03 09:08:00,awsdrv,2,1,"My sister's ex BF just told her he is starting an m to f transition process. Sis (or any of us for that matter) hadn't seen it coming, she is devastated, because she id still hung up on them maybe getting back together and I want to support her in turning her feelings around so she can support him transitioning in stead. I'll call the ex he/him in here, for ease. But will of course call him by whatever pronouns he prefers in the future. 

Background: My sister is challenged in her learning abilities and her maturity level and in many situations has the mind of a teen despite being in her late 20's. The ex BF suffers from autism and is challenged in social constructs. 

We all love the ex in spite of not having met him a lot of times, he is sweet, respectful and great, but we also all agree that due to some behavioral issues that we attributed to the autism he was unfortunately unable to be the partner my sister needed and wanted. They have known each other since childhood, and had an agreement that if neither had partners when getting old, they'd move in together and give it another go.

My sister broke it off years ago, and had to have some distance because she was heartbroken. 

My sister's been hung up. She has not had a serious relationship since this guy and I have been trying to get her to understand that he would never be the guy for her (I never imagined how right I was) to get her to let go and live a fuller/better life. In vain, but I tried. 

The contact between them has been scarce, but a few days ago he texted her telling her about transitioning and how he was asked if he wanted to save/freeze down some sperm to be able to have biological children, and wanted to ask her if she wanted him to do that, since he wouldn't be able to honor their ""getting together when old"" agreement. None of us had any idea and were shocked. 

My sister is crushed. She called me sobbing, and I managed to talk her down a bit. She is not quite ready to be supportive of ex just yet, but she's a good girl, she will be. Right now she is feeling all the selfish, confused and jumbled up feelings that she is entitled to, but should not share with ex. She is grieving that her hope to get back together someday is forever gone, she is conflicted about the sperm thing even though she doesn't want children. Right now she is a mess, but she'll be fine.

Meanwhile I want to try and help her see things from a different perspective when she has had a bit of time to cry it out and help her see how this is a good thing. Ex has finally found out why he is feeling out of place, ex was being considerate of her, thinking her into his decision on the sperm. He did not have to do that. And now she can finally bury all hope of getting back together which has been holding her back for years. 

How do I help her get there and am I right in thinking she should keep how this news has affected her from ex unless asked directly by ex? To me her negative reaction is not what ex needs right now, he needs all the support he can get.

I'm sorry if this is unclear and jumbled up, but it is all so new, and I am just trying to support both my sister and her ex. Ex is a good person, no matter which gender (s)he is identifying with and I just want the best for both of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I only started having actual serious thoughts about my gender identity roughly one year ago. Before then the concept of being trans was something I entertained in passing but never really thought actually applied to me. I can't even remember what exactly triggered it, but I remember talking to a fair few trans friends about their experiences and realizing that I related to more of them than I realized. Ever since then the thoughts have only been getting stronger to the point where I feel like I can't really just ignore them any more.

&amp;#x200B;

I have my first GIC appointment lined up for May. I don't know how it's going to go but the main reservations I have are the following:  


1) I've never really felt ""uncomfortable"" in my body/hated what I see in the mirror. I look in the mirror and I feel mostly indifferent to what I see, but I definitely like it more when I see more typically feminine traits (being clean shaven is a big one, I really dislike how I look with facial hair). At the same time, I don't feel crippled on a daily basis by this experience. Just that the idea of being a girl really appeals to me.

2) I feel shallow for wanting something that's solely superficial/based on looks. No matter how many times I tell myself that it's ridiculous or get told it's valid to have these feelings, I just feel like I should be happy with what I have and hate myself for not being so. I worry that I'm using this as a cover up for my general feelings of inadequacy and lack of fulfilment as a person. 

3) I have a large extended family that I love very much, but they're all very... ""normal"" for lack of a better word. And although I don't think they'd shun me if I came out as trans, the idea of explaining this all to them and becoming a ""talking point"" as I'm sure I would really does not sit well with me.

3.5) Half of said extended family comes from Brazil and I'm sure I don't even need to mention how terribly trans people are treated there. I don't want to feel unwelcome and unsafe in one of my home countries, especially given the current political climate there.

4) I already talked about these feelings with my mum and she kinda surprised me in the sense that she said she more saw me as kind of gender neutral anyway. She said she'd support me no matter what I decided but she did say she thought if I did HRT she thinks I'd end up regretting it in the long run.

It was okay for like a day, but then I found out he got grounded for ‚Äúlife‚Äù and had his phone taken away. He then casually found a way to blame me for it and said his parents hated my guts causing me to cry afterwards[I am a really emotional person]. I am already dealing with personal issues with this on top of it so this really hurt.

  Let‚Äôs go back to a few weeks after we first met. He told me about a mental disorder called D.I.D. and how he was clinically diagnosed with it. Otherwise known as Dissociative Identity Disorder. It is where you have multiple personalities in your head. They are able to change and come out at free will. I supported him completely and soon got to know the personalities. He had backgrounds and names, one even had a British accent. But back to the main topic.

  After he blamed me for his grounding, I had to leave school early due to a severe anxiety attack that seemed endless. After a week, his mom texted me. She informed me of why he was grounded and said that he lied about his disorder and about how he wasn‚Äôt transgender. She also told me about how she actually didn‚Äôt hate me. I had enough and after the weekend ended, I ended it.

  After a few days, me and my friends noticed that he‚Äôd appear out of nowhere. He would be nowhere near us, then the next moment he would be within arms reach. This continued for the next week or so until I got called to the guidance councilors office. I walked to the councilors office and immediately saw my ex, shaking. I froze. After a moment, I sat down in the remaining chair which happened to be next to him. Then, she started to talk.

  She started to talk about how she wanted me back and how I left her. She even said she couldn‚Äôt get me out of her head and that she loved me. Hell, she admitted to stalking me. I‚Äôm half tempted to file a restraining order if it continues. Ever since the visit with him, I‚Äôve gained a stutter which won‚Äôt go away.

108,2019-03-04 14:25:54,ax7opw,5,0,"This is probably gonna sound very problematic, but I have an overall philosophical theory that might help explain being trans? It also includes explanations for Therian/Otherkin, and age regression, so if that‚Äôs gonna bother you, read no further.

Basically, the theory stems from an ancient (Greek I believe?) theory that everyone has alternative personalities living inside of them. Similar to Alters, or people with OSDD, these personalities can take many forms, including forms that don‚Äôt accurately match what the body portrays. While most people integrate throughout their lives, some people are affected by trauma and haunting experiences, and their mind is unable to integrate properly. These people are diagnosed with DID, OSDD, or similar.

Following me so far?

If you know anything about alters in DID or OSDD, you know that they can take many forms. Alters can be different genders, ages, sexualities, races, or even species from the host. 

Basically the theory is that people who identify as transgender, otherkin, etc.. integrated into a single overarching protector personality that doesn‚Äôt match their body‚Äôs presentation.

Not sure if it‚Äôs offensive to associate being trans with being a therian, or to associate it with DID/OSDD, but it‚Äôs absolutely not my intention to be rude or insensitive. I don‚Äôt think being trans is a mental illness, or something bad in any way shape or form, this is just a dumb cis person‚Äôs theory, and I acknowledge it could be and probably is completely wrong.

Similar to Alters, or people with OSDD, these personalities can take many forms, including forms that don‚Äôt accurately match what the body portrays. While most people integrate throughout their lives, some people are affected by trauma and haunting experiences, and their mind is unable to integrate properly. These people are diagnosed with DID, OSDD, or similar.\n\nFollowing me so far?\n\nIf you know anything about alters in DID or OSDD, you know that they can take many forms. Alters can be different genders, ages, sexualities, races, or even species from the host. \n\nBasically the theory is that people who identify as transgender, otherkin, etc.. integrated into a single overarching protector personality that doesn‚Äôt match their body‚Äôs presentation.\n\nNot sure if it‚Äôs offensive to associate being trans with being a therian, or to associate it with DID/OSDD, but it‚Äôs absolutely not my intention to be rude or insensitive. I don‚Äôt think being trans is a mental illness, or something bad in any way shape or form, this is just a dumb cis person‚Äôs theory, and I acknowledge it could be and probably is completely wrong. \n\nI just wanted to get some thoughts on this, since it‚Äôs been in my head for a little while..\n\nSending all my love to the community ‚ù§Ô∏è\nYou guys are brave and strong for being who you are, and I would never want to undermine that ', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'So this might be really controversial but I have a theory', 'created': 1551734754.0}"

Warning, this question assumes the social construction of gender **theory**.   


We use the term male and female to identify a biological process of chromosome determination. Yet we also use the same terminology for a social decision of gender. What I see here, is that we use the same word for two entirely different things, and it's true gender and sex are not the same thing. So why don't we use different words for chromosome determination? It would seem that would open us up for more fluidity with gender. If XX was (insert a new word: AAA) and XY was (insert a new word: BBB) then AAA could be any gender or non-gender, and BBB could be any gender or non-gender, and we would be open to so many more forms of expressing who we really are, without them being in conflict with our chromosomes.

Like, I didn‚Äôt show signs young enough, I‚Äôm to feminine, I just want attention, I‚Äôm just nonbinary, or I‚Äôm just a tomboy. It‚Äôs been stressing me out because now I‚Äôm actually not sure. I just wrote this poem thing to express how I feel.


I couldn't tell you a thing about my past. I literally only have vague and random memories from my childhood. I‚Äôve been seeing trans guys that are like: ""Oh yeah, when I was five I cut big chucks out of my hair and said I was a boy."" Or ""Yay even when I was little I never felt like a girl."" Even ""When I was little I taught myself how to pee standing up because I knew I was a boy.""

All I remember from being little is useless stuff. I couldn't count to one hundred, I was better friends with our classroom  jar of worms than anyone in our class, I cried when I didn't get the part of the big bad wolf, I shoved baby dolls in play microwaves, and cut my hair with craft scissors because a kid dared me to.

I really had no concept of gender, I just was me. Because I was five and I wanted to be a dragon not a boy. I wanted to fly and be able to breathe underwater. I didn't give a shit if I was in a dress or wearing shorts or wearing the most mismatch outfit ever. I wanted to run and get dirty and yell and hit beehives and dig up worms. 

Because thats what kids do. They climb trees and cry because they can't get back down. They form gangs and play bade blades as recess. They play pirates with sticks, catch bugs, and break the rules. They hold hands and eat dandelion steams because they think they have milk in them. They fall down and they fight and they form who they're going to be in the future. 

I didn't think about the fact the wearing a jean skirt past my knees, a pink horse turtle neck, and turquoise cowboy boots was girly and very unfashionable. I wore it because my nanny wore jean skirts and because I wanted to be a cowboy. I didn't think about how wearing a blue dress with tutu and tinker bell on it was girly I wanted to be able to fly and I could run around just the same. 

I didn't grow up thinking I was a boy. I grew up knowing I was myself. 

So why is all that changing now, why are all these labels getting to my head? Why can't I just be me agian?

A flat chested tomboy who didn't give a shit what the rest of the world thought. I kid who wore pink dress and wanted to be a dragon. A kid who ate sand and jumped from trees, who got asthma and still ran until you had to force an inhaler into my mouth.

What happened to childhood? Because I want it back. I just want to be me again, not the label that they put on me.

 I do believe I‚Äôm trans, I just miss not having a label. I miss just getting to be whoever I wanted.

Hope to see you there!

I think it's important that we have positive images of trans characters appearing on TV, because that's how the average person is going to see us. TV has always shaped public perception, and with this issue it's no different. I don't mean to come on here just to advertise a server, so please use this thread as a way to talk about the best and worst representations of trans people we've seen in the media so far. To give n example, Denise from the original airing of Twin Peaks was always a good portrayal of us, I think. Cooper never sees her as anything but who she is, and her character isn't played as a joke. She's competent and her gender doesn't define her character. That's a lot for a 1991 TV show.

167,2019-03-06 17:59:14,ay1r8u,9,82,"I'm an afab 20 (soon to be 21) person in a relationship with an amab (soon to be 22) person. We've been dating for a year and five months and we've the happiest we've ever been in a relationship. We've had ups and downs since we started off as friends with benefits but we're very close now.

However, I'm an in the closet transmasculine nb person who hasn't come out and doesn't plan to any time soon. At least to people besides my openly LGBT friends. Mostly because I don't want to be wrong about my identity. Also because my family is conservative, religious and transphobic. I don't want to come off as a transtrender. I know my identity won't be taken seriously by most so I don't have a lot of incentive to not repress and deal with my buried away social dysphoria. My aspergers also likely contributes to this so I don't know if my identity is real or autism related.

I'm bisexual and I've always had a preference for women but resorted to dating exclusively men after a relationship with a woman to avoid issues with my family. 

My partner is also bisexual, and had a preference for boys since he was young. He was often the subject of teasing and bullying for their feminine personality as child and has admitted to having some internalized homophobia/transphobia as a result. He often feels insecure as labelling himself as bi bc of this, perhaps.

He comes from an eastern european family that is socially conservative so you can imagine how much lgbt people repress their identities in these queerphobic environments. Toxic masculinity was also a large element in his upbringing. 

My partner has opened up a lot to me about his attraction to men after learning more from having accepting and lgbt friends, as well as having a ""bisexual gf"". However it's his gender identity that he's really vague about.

He will label himself as male and present as male to male friends and peers that come from that cishetero ""bro"" environment if you know what I mean. 

However he always stands out because of his feminine mannerisms, soft voice and long hair. He had (still has) a lot of female friends as a teen. He is interested in drag and wants to be able to do it with lgbt friends when we go back to live in a more accepting place like Denmark after the summer holidays. He points to drag/transfeminine characters in media that pops up with ""That's me"", as a ""joke"". He has asked me at least five times if I would still love him if he was a trans girl, then when I get serious he backpedals and says it's a ""joke"". He calls himself genderfluid almost everyday now as a running ""joke"" in the past week, in the past it has been that or agender but less often. He crosses his legs. He ALWAYS plays as a girl in rpg videogames, and flipped with delight at the option of a drag outfit Link can wear in Breath Of The Wild.

""If I can't play as a girl, what's the point"" he says.

He is emotionally intelligent compared to most other men. He is affectionate, warm, gives great advice, is a good listener and always supports his male friends emotionally in a way their other male friends cannot.

He also was chronically insecure and uncomfortable with his body for a long time until I helped him relax more. He still feels insecure about it even though he arguably is attractive with a nice figure. He wouldn't go to the beach without a shirt, god forbid shower with his gf when we started dating, even after we already had sex.

In the past I basically was forcing myself to be attracted to the men who wanted to date me, perhaps as a result of compulsory heterosexuality. I would have sex with them to try and get closer but I felt no attraction to them, not emotionally or physically. 

Maybe I'm projecting my trans experience onto my bf but he was the first ""man"" I felt genuinely attracted to. To be honest it's because I felt a stong feminine and emotionally mature energy from him since we first started dating. We joke all the time that a lot of the gender roles are switched in the relationship- in terms of tasks, emotional dynamics, and behavioural patterns. 

I don't want my partner to be something they're not. I would never want to push them to become trans or something. That's why I find it difficult to discuss this with them. 

If they're just a gnc bi guy that's okay. But if they're a transfeminine nonbinary person, genderfluid, agender or a transwoman, it would make a lot of sense. I'm not saying that any of the traits he has is anything that makes someone a woman in isolation. But together, he is showing a lot of signs that remind me of how my other trans friends were while in the closet. 

It's frustrating because everytime I try to address this elephant in the room (after he makes the same ""joke"" for the 10th time in a way he doesnt do with his other memes) he backpedals, becomes defensive and says he wasn't that serious after all. 

Although yesterday he rambled on and was saying stuff unprompted like ""I'm genderfluid! I don't know, I don't know if I care about my gender. Is there a ""It's complicated"" option for gender on facebook? While laughing.

The thing is he doesn't really know that I think I'm trans myself.

He is not transpohobic, and has learned a lot from his lgbt friends after coming from an ignorant &amp; homophobic environment. He fully acknowledges that gender is in the brain and not the body and defends gay/trans ppl when confronted with trans/homophobic ideology. Of course he still admits he has some internalized transphobia/misinfo and sometimes we both make edgy jokes about gender politics that don't mean any harm.

I tried to talk with him about my social dysphoria before but chickened out. He kind of knows I'm at the very least gender nonconforming, and sometimes talks about me as a man or boy as a form of affection, closeness. But I feel terrible that I haven't been open with him about the extent of it, especially when he might be confused himself.

I'm deeply afraid of being rejected for being trans male. My ex was transphobic and pushed me deep into repression whenever I had any masculine tendencies.

My current partner is bisexual, like I said, but doesn't believe he could be in a relationship with a guy outside of sex. Maybe it's unfair of me to say but this belief could be due to internalized homophobia from being raised as a cishetero man. 

But I also don't want to decide or label my partner with anything he doesn't feel comfortable with. I want them to be happy and I want to be open with him about myself too but I am not sure how to proceed. 

We need to have a conversation about it but my autism makes it difficult to tell if he's joking or not and also makes it difficult to initiate a serious convo about it that doesn't end up with us joking, backpedaling and evading the elephant in the room.

sex is *quite old* - it appeared as a way to give organisms the ability to specialise in stuff without their species becoming incapable of other stuff at the same time. they got two sexes because that way it's safer - it's kinda difficult to make more than 2 animals stick together in order to be a fully functional unit of life

those early forms of life didn't have *brains*, only nerve cell chains that performed simple algorithms. humans *didn't* get rid of it, they just built their stuff on top.

as a rule of thumb, in most species their bodies only come with *one* instruction set (which is determined by brain feminisation/masculinisation), in order to save precious matter; so animals (or people) relying on that set to do most of everything wouldn't be able to function if they got the wrong one.

our cooler brain parts work on *glucose*, which is rare in nature - so we instead fall back on more primitive systems whenever possible (leading to biases) for easier survival. like love and fear take over reason, so does dysphoria - a very deep disconnect.

think of two stacks of books of equal height, with a third one on top of both of them. if you pull on one of the bottom ones, the whole structure will collapse. this is kind of analogous to dysphoria manifesting itself in society's terms (even though its rules aren't intrinsic to our bodies) - remember, we built it all *on top* of what out ancestors had.

After questioning, exploring, discussing and testing for about a year, I feel like I have found an answer, at least for now. I am a trans woman, but won't transition. 

In therapy and many other places I heard the question ""how do I handle [insert problem/bad experience]"" and I noticed that at least in my case, handling a problem always means to find an answer to a certain question. In some cases it was ""why is it like that"" or ""what does that mean"".

Well, in the case of being transgender, it came to the question ""what am I gonna do with this?"" It was very early clear to me that I am trans, that nothing would make me happier than being a woman. But that was not the answer I needed, that came a lot later. In the form of my girlfriend. She is (obviously) the best person on earth an has given me waaaay more than I deserve. And she decided to become a couple despite knowing that I am trans and might make her a lesbian, an idea that she wasn't exactly fond of, but kept quiet, because she didn't want to be in the way of my happiness.

But after a while I asked her what her real thaughts about this are and her answer was basically that she is not against it, especially if it means I am happy, but she loves me the way I am and is afraid of a transition changing exactly that. Maybe not true, but gender is a huge part of personality after all, so it's not unreasonable. But my decision was not because of this (although it would be a lie to say it didn't have a part in this).

It made me think, what do I want to do with my trans-ness? What to do with this incredibly rare ressource inside me? And those questions finally brought the answer. In my case and my living situation, it just does not seem exactly worth it. I am one of the blessed persons who do not absolutely despise their body. Not fond of it, at all, but I think I can make it work. So if I train and work on myself, psychologically and physically, I can make myself maybe not the person I should have been born as, but something I can still be proud of.

Sure, it will always be harder than for me than for cis guys, but transition is risky and a very very hard path to follow. My respect and utmost envy to everyone doing it. So yea, my answer is the following: I choose not to become what I should have been born as, but will use the old me, which failed at life and the girl sleeping inside me to forge a person in between both sides, making me a ""hetero sexual, bright pink loving trans-y 'boy'friend""

First, I know it might all get better, but this is just situation as it is NOW.

&amp;#x200B;

If you need a name, call me Shiro as I haven't decided on new name yet (thinking about Tobias and Nataniel). I'm 16 years old trans boy. I told my parents and few of my friends, but I really present as male only on the internet. But, my parents don't believe me. My mom told my threapist TWO times how beautiful girl I am and that I just don't wan't to accept myself because I suffered from ED and I was bullied for major time of my elementary school. Also, I am not zou tzpical masculine guy. I don't like sport much. I would preffer to recieve flowers over anzthing else, I love my plushes (mainly big yellow dog called Jupiter I took when my older brother wanted to throw him out. This dog is a lot for me), I am an artist and unbelievably hopeless romantic. And yes, all those things are associeted with females in my family. I have short hair, which is really silly, but yes, even this is more common in women than men in my family. Basically, I am you average girl if you take a look at my family.

&amp;#x200B;

Now comes the sad and possibly homeless part, when I gave you some background. My mom did agreed to go to sexuologist with me/ but she told me she will do it when she has time. I know work is more important to her, so I am trying to belive her she really does not have time. But deep down, I know she doesn't want me to go, because she is scared I will eventually start trasition. I want you to know I undertsand her reasons. And I am trying to open up to her about this gender issue a bit, but she will always just shut me down, raise her voice if I won't shut up. She told me two times she is not going to support me in any way, which hurts a lot. My dad thinks I'm typical female becasue I want to be physically a man/ basically ""You have to put up with everything and there are no shortcuts. Every woman hates her periods"" -I doubt every woman wants to rip her guts out to stop that thing. The thing is, if they will kick me out, I will end up homeless. Becasue I can't pay for anything I would need, and I'm the type of person that will feel bad if they will go to live someone else, not being financially able to help them.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just really scared at this point and I hope I will able to get support from my parents, or at least acceptance. I feel guilty for feeling that this body just does not fit and for the fact my parents are sad. Or at least my mom. I know. I see. And I feel very bad for it, because I caused it.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't seek a resolution or comfortation, at least not as a primar of this post. I just wanted to pour my stupidly big aching heart out to someone who I know will listen, because many of you probably went through something similar.

So worth it.

I had my orchiectomy with Dr. Arnkoff in Farmington MI. He is the most straightforward doc I've met. Knew his stuff, don't be turned off by the fact that you call him directly on his personal cell and he covers exactly the facts as you want them and nothing else.

I showed up at a clinic with a cashier's check, not entirely certain that it would all work out, but if you want to do this your way without gatekeeping you have to take some leaps of faith.

Fortunately this community has been amazing. Resources like reddit and susan's place helped me find a doctor that was competent, used my pronouns, and most importantly there was none of the judgmental gatekeeping that would have forced me into 10 more months of destructive anti-androgens before I could consider a consult with one of two medical teams in the state.

It was so straightforward. The doc and an assistant who held my hand when he cut through the scar tissue of an old vasectomy.

I had such big horrible balls grafted onto me. Both of them mentioned the horrible size of them, in a professional manner. There was a reason I could never tuck.

My heart was racing, for some reason we were listening to the Carpenters as he made the first few incisions. Local anesthetic. The shots hurt but were increasingly dull as they got deep into the sac. By the time the were removing organs what I felt was mostly tugging.

And the intensity of my own imagination.

I would not look down. I was breathing so heavily, my body shaking with shock, until the moment he removed that thing from me.

Then tears. Instant, shockingly profound relief as that toxic feedback loop closed forever. I was sobbing as I described my dysphoria, clenching that assistant's hand, it was like a birth.

Once they removed the second pustule i eased up. my demeanor has shifted. I read as happy where before people could always sense my discomfort and pain.

I am changed. I am free.

Looking at them on the operating table, they were never mine. They were always invaders. They were always toxic little planted assassins, and I felt no sense of loss. I have carried them for 33 years out of some twisted sense of obligation, but now I have been struck from my ball-and-chain.

No one that knows who they are and what they need should have to wait. This is too safe and effective to bear such stigma.

When I was a kid, I wanted to be a boy so bad from the age of 5-11. I dressed like a boy, played with the boys at school, and tried to hide my long hair. A lot of kids actually thought I was a boy. I knew I liked girls too. My adopted mom kept saying, ‚Äú(name), you‚Äôre a girl.‚Äù That rubbed me the wrong way a lot of times. 

Once I go into 6th grade, I started being more like a girl due to the lockrook for PE. I dressed still like a tomboy though. I got more comfortable being a girl, but there was always something missing. 

Throughout high school, I still was a tomboy; and even in college (still in college). Right now I feel more comfortable as a female and I have a girlfriend whom I love. It was all thanks to this one hook-up I did with my best friend in college at the time. I never had a best friend who was a lesbian and she showed me that it was okay to be. 

I can‚Äôt help by wonder though that, yes I am a lesbian, but when I‚Äôm around my girlfriend, a lot of the time I feel like I‚Äôm going back to my younger self and feel like a guy again. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is appropriate or not and someone is welcome to tell me otherwise and I‚Äôll delete it, but I feel like I have the parts of a guy down there sometimes when I don‚Äôt. I felt it as a kid and I still feel it today.

So give yourself self exams and if you find a lump, call your doctor. Here are some tips on WHAT TO DO. Because **knowing** is half the battle!   

## How should a breast/chest self-exam be performed? 

### 	1) In the Shower¬†

	Using the pads of your fingers, move around your entire breast in a  circular pattern moving from the outside to the center, checking the  entire breast and armpit area. Check both breasts each month feeling for  any lump, thickening, or hardened knot. Notice any changes and get  lumps evaluated by your healthcare provider.

### 	2) In Front of a Mirror¬†

	Visually inspect your breasts with your arms at your sides. Next, raise your arms high overhead.

	Look for any changes in the contour, any swelling, or dimpling of the  skin, or changes in the nipples. Next, rest your palms on your hips and  press firmly to flex your chest muscles. Left and right breasts will not  exactly match‚Äîfew women's breasts do, so look for any dimpling,  puckering, or changes, particularly on one side.

### 	3) Lying Down

	When lying down, the breast tissue spreads out evenly along the chest  wall. Place a pillow under your right shoulder and your right arm behind  your head. Using your left hand, move the pads of your fingers around  your right breast gently in small circular motions covering the entire  breast area and armpit.

	Use light, medium, and firm pressure. Squeeze the nipple; check for  discharge and lumps. Repeat these steps for your left breast.",trans,Y'ALL.

I‚Äôm dfab, but for pretty much as long as I can remember, maybe since I was a little kid I‚Äôve seen myself as male. Even if I have long hair and I‚Äôm wearing dresses, I see myself as male, and I feel comfortable with myself. I guess I think of myself as a cross dresser, I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes I have short hair and dress more masculine and it makes me feel good, I like to wear both genders of clothes. 

But when I feel dysphoria, is when I remember society doesn‚Äôt see me as male. Thinking about that is making me tear up. I see myself and my body as male, but society doesn‚Äôt and it hurts. I usually don‚Äôt have any problem with what I was born with, I‚Äôm confident in my body, I have small breasts and I‚Äôm very thin so I think I have a cute and sexy, sort of androgynous body. It‚Äôs just when I remember what the world thinks of me and it hurts so much. That‚Äôs when I feel dysphoria, when I‚Äôm not seen as a boy. I wish everyone could see me and just know I‚Äôm a boy. But they don‚Äôt and it hurts. It‚Äôs easy to have people call me a male online but I can‚Äôt convince people in real life so easily. Other times I feel dysphoria are when I watch porn maybe. I‚Äôm always wishing I was the man , I wish I could use my penis on a girl. When I masturbate it feels like a penis should be there. And then I start to feel inferior. Like I could never please a girl the way a man with a penis could and I‚Äôm not good enough because I don‚Äôt have one. A while ago I dated a gay trans man who made me feel so terrible about having a vagina when I was ok with it. He would say they are ugly and pretend I had a penis. So I feel inferior and like I‚Äôm not good enough because I don‚Äôt have a penis.

But I‚Äôm usually ok usually with what I have by myself and surgery and hormones sound scary. I don‚Äôt know if I could ever commit to something like that. I feel like my feelings go back and forth and I‚Äôm constantly confused and wondering what I am. When I google about trans men and sex I can never really identify with it, A lot of trans men seem so uncomfortable about being touched or what their parts are called and that‚Äôs fine, I understand, but me personally I‚Äôll call my parts a pussy or let people touch my breasts if they like them and it seems like no other people would ever like that and I feel more confused. I feel like I fall under the definition of a ‚Äútranstrender‚Äù and it makes me cry, because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm female, I think I‚Äôm male. What am I!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Another problem is I identify with loving women, so it feels so confusing and bad. I identify with lesbians and feminine people loving each other and I feel more confused. I feel overwhelmed and sad.

What if I started interviewing - on camera - military members who‚Äôs lives have been impacted by a trans service member? My perspective is that there is NO reason a trans service member should not be able to serve openly in the military. I also believe (tho I need to do research) there is NO evidence that shows service members who are trans (and pls forgive me if I‚Äôm not using the best term - I‚Äôm always open to learning!) are any more of a burden on the military than other service members. 

I think that showing conversations &amp; interviews with trans service members &amp; their colleagues who work alongside them could help ‚Äúunconvinced‚Äù Americans open their eyes to the reality of the situation: that trans service members are patriots who work hard every day to serve our country and serve with distinction. 

And I would like to be a small part of that message. What I would like to do is look into grants for this, hire an inclusive team to research/shoot &amp; distribute these pieces to a wider audience. However; because I am an ally and not one who has personally lived through this experience, I was hoping to reach out to you lovely folks on this sub to see if you have opinions on such a project, and how I could work with an inclusive team to produce something truly excellent.

I'm just a regular guy, who honestly has some questions, born out of curiosity, and the desire to understand other people better.

I don't have any trans acquittances I could get some perspective from, I don't have any strong emotional investment in any political, religious, racial, or any other kind of agenda.

I'm no a writer, reporter, advisor, lawmaker, or seek any kind of benefit other than personal growth.

I wish you all the best, as much as that can be wished to a stranger than you've never met.
I don't consider any of you worse, or for that matter, better than any other person I don't know, just because you belong to the LGBT community.

Sorry for the somewhat lengthy introduction, but I really want to stress the the questions I have will not be meant as personal attacks to anyone, the trans topic seems to be, understandably, very emotionally charged.

If anything I say/ask offends you, I apologize in advance, I didn't mean to, please remember that I'm not in your shoes, and It might be hard for me to understand where you are coming from.

At the same time, please try not to be deride my questions, comments, or concerns if they seem somewhat insensitive, remember the previous paragraph, for lack of a better metaphor, I'm being the fat guy at the gym here.

All that being said I have questions, some of them, due to personal and maybe somewhat uneducated conclusions, might be misinterpreted as attacks, and I'd like to start a conversation, not a debate.

so i'm a trans woman, pre-HRT, still in school, and not out to my family, or friends, or really anyone but my closest circle.

i started going to an after-school club, i forget the term but it's basically an LGBTQ space, so i could be around, well, people like me.  
i was mildly disappointed to realize it was 99% trans men, and not a trans woman in sight.  
i recently moved to the current school system, and only just now found out that *not a single out trans woman has graduated because she's either had to move or be homeschooled due to transphobia*.

i'll save the whole ""it's easier for trans guys in some regards because &lt;X&gt;"" bs for an r/unpopularopinion post, but anyways, i was already on edge. i have shit self-esteem, so i figured that i was screwed.

imagine my surprise when three of the most transphobic, r/dankmemes, assholish, it's-funny-to-be-offensive types use my trans name.

imagine my surprise when i find out that someone outed me.

imagine the downright breakdown i had when i had to cover it all up like a fucking slander, then try to find out who it was.

imagine my hurt when i realize that it was someone i trusted. a lot.

so, for some reason, one of the girls in the club (i dont know her name but i always identified her as Highlighter or Lesbian since she's the only lesbian and has bright yellow hair) outed me to a trio of Catholic (as in ""homosexuality is a sin"" Catholic), transphobic (a trans girl is a trap/dickgirl, a trans guy is a girl in her boyfriend's shirt), and just mean people she could have.  
and then one of them asked another club member (whom i don't blame as much as the first, since in this case it was more of a ""Morgan told me she goes by she/her in club, is this true?"" deal). and now i'm outed. and terrified. it's not entirely out yet but my parents wouldn't ever help me since their experience with trans people is SJW Gone Mad (Cringe Comp) videos, the school wouldn't do shit, and i'm trapped.

I hoping it's just a phase, I really dont want to tell my family that I want to be a girl, I feel like they'd never understand how I feel, and I'd never be able to become who I want to be. Mabey I feel this way because of stress and my depression.

 Also, I dont want to be labeled a freak or anything, my whole school doesn't like people who are LGBT.  

If this is not a phase and a real feeling, I'm afraid of everyone else's reaction, because I've been cisgender all my life, also is it normal to want to change your gender later on in life?

Yes, that fits.

I truly felt happy as I realized how obvious it was and how oblivious I was being. I have felt this way for a while, and only now have I gained the courage to speak out about it. I want to be a girl. I am a fairly young male, at about 13 years old. I have wanted this for a while now, but only recently really having felt more strongly about it. I have not told anybody except this one friend I dont trust anymore, he is nice enough not to tell a single person but fucked enough to screw with me and almost let it out by accident. I shouldn't have, but I lied to him saying that I didn't think I wanted it anymore. Now about my experience, for a while now I have shown feelings myself about puberty and the male features I have, and mostly haven't liked it all that much. I get disgusted and annoyed at my genitals and the hair around them, and I hate when it goes erect and it just isn't comfortable. I have always ignored my arm and leg hair, but when it grew a whiiiiile ago I was a bit surprised. I also didn't pay much attention to other things, but they were all a little bit surprising to me. I dread all body hair and facial now, too, because I just have such a strong desire to be a woman. My dad is practically a hairy ape and I always knew I didn't want that but understood I probably would end up like that. I despise facial hair and chest hair. Recently saw some growing in and man am I not happy.

I am a fairly young male, at about 13 years old. I have wanted this for a while now, but only recently really having felt more strongly about it. I have not told anybody except this one friend I dont trust anymore, he is nice enough not to tell a single person but fucked enough to screw with me and almost let it out by accident. I shouldn\'t have, but I lied to him saying that I didn\'t think I wanted it anymore. Now about my experience, for a while now I have shown feelings myself about puberty and the male features I have, and mostly haven\'t liked it all that much. I get disgusted and annoyed at my genitals and the hair around them, and I hate when it goes erect and it just isn\'t comfortable. I have always ignored my arm and leg hair, but when it grew a whiiiiile ago I was a bit surprised. I also didn\'t pay much attention to other things, but they were all a little bit surprising to me. I dread all body hair and facial now, too, because I just have such a strong desire to be a woman. My dad is practically a hairy ape and I always knew I didn\'t want that but understood I probably would end up like that. I despise facial hair and chest hair.

Are orgasms the same? in other words, from male to female do you experience the same orgasm effect as a former male? or has the surgical techniques improved so that the feeling is that of a woman having an orgasm.

386,2019-03-15 15:54:25,b1gkba,0,1,"So when my partner found out I was trans. It wasn't so great. They found out from an ex who outed me, because they were angry I was no longer with them and hoped that it would ruin my relationship. 

I'm very particular with who I tell mostly because the first person I came out to, the experience was absolutely horrible. I don't really want to talk about it in this post but let's just say, it was enough for me to pretty much want to never tell anyone or make any effort to be me (but of course, that eats away at me inside). Pretty much no one knew, except the first person I told, and my ex because I thought I could trust them. 

I wasn't anywhere near ready to speak up about it, I trusted my partner, but I was afraid. My partner asked me if it was true, and they were pretty shocked when I admitted it. (I'm ftm, I've made little to no effort to pass due to wanting to get a job, move and be the real me somewhere else at that time.) They weren't particularly comfortable, but the reason was because they weren't attracted to men. They weren't bi, so it's fair that they weren't comfortable knowing I'm a guy. 

My partner loves me for my personality so they stayed and gave the relationship a go, they told me if it didn't work out because they aren't attracted to men, we would be best friends instead. They were very encouraging about my transition from the start though. (which after learning they came from a conservative place and a Conservative family, it was honestly shocking to me) they did so much research to become familiar with the process and everything to understand what I was feeling, what I'm going through and what I will be going through, to the best of their ability. But also they would ask me questions because of course, everyone transitions differently. All of this, was so much more than I could ever ask for. 

About over a year, nearly 2 years passes, they've become a lot more accepting about me being a man. Things start becoming sexual between us, but no sex. It's not something either of us are ready for just yet. (at this point I'm 18/19 and have finally gained interest in sex, my partner is close to my age, just a little older and has not sexually matured at this point. We both thought they were asexual, but later on we found out we are both demisexual. My partner wanted me to be happy and would do these things with me when I asked, but I didn't ask often because I felt like it was selfish to) 

Another 2 years pass, they no longer mind that I'm male. They have begun referring to me as their husband/hubby to people they trust. (we're not yet married, we're engaged, but my partner loves calling me their hubby in front of people and not get afraid of the backlash either of us will get. Beforehand I was introduced as what I am. ""fiancee"" for safety reasons of course.) which has made me comfortable enough to actually put effort in looking like the man I am. Outside of the home. It was a big step that I've delayed out of fear. But my partner showed me I can trust people. It's not always bad. 

2 more years. I'm walking around my local adult store. I see a packer. I've delayed buying them online because Ive never been able to afford it (and honestly I was scared of how my partner would react, I knew they accept me for who I am at this point. But I wasn't entirely sure if they were ready for the changes to my body) but this one was cheap (so was the quality). Without even thinking about whether my partner would react positively or negatively, I bought it and went straight home in excitement. I was so excited about this, I was really hopeful about their reaction.

Eventually it comes to me showing them. It gets pretty personal here but my partner was really excited and happy to see that part of me that was missing. Even if it's just a prosthetic for now, all the fear that I had in the back of my mind was gone. Unfortunately that prosthetic wasn't made to be used during sex, so they were pretty upset learning that. (I'm still not ready for sex at this point. It was disappointing knowing I couldn't use it yet, but I've been setting my eyes on one that looks more real and can be used for sex. As well as sleeping with it. Even though the one I had said I shouldn't sleep with it, of course I didn't listen. I'm an active sleeper, the material was cheap and of course it broke. And that was devastating.)

Fast forward to now. I'm still not financially stable but I'm at the point where I'm considering hormones. My partner of course is accepting of this and is waiting for me to take my next step.
Theres things that have been holding me back from this treatment. The fear of the hormones fucking with me.

You see, because of a problem with my body biologically, I suffer with chronic physical pain. Painkillers never work so one of the things they tried with me was hormone treatment. They treated me with estrogen. I couldn't see through the entire treatment to see if it could help with the pain because it fucked with my head really bad. I cried all the time. And was a lot more suicidal than I was before the treatment. I hated myself more than I did. Though it was the wrong hormones for me. I'm scared I'll react the same with the right hormones.

406,2019-03-16 01:21:33,b1mv59,14,13,"Not all trans women feel the urge to present as femme, you know?
If you desire something and are told you can not have it, sometimes the person is okay with it and sometimes they aren't.

I have always been a very tomboyish person. I'm mtf but I don't feel dysphoria about my genitals or lack of chest. I dont particularly feel I'm missing out when I'm not wearing skirts or dresses. It happens on occasion but it absolutely isn't a necessity. Bottom line is, dysphoria is nearly always a result of expectations, either expectations we put on ourselves or society puts on us. If you're not the kind of person that lets expectations bother you, then that part of your personality doesn't just magically dissapear because you're trans.

My biggest signifier as to why I'm trans is that I strongly and passionately disagree with *being* a man. I cannot see myself as a man, and I don't feel like one. I dont need to look at my body and yearn for something different to know that I am a woman. It's enough that society is constantly trying to scrutinize trans people and their decisions, the last frontier we need is other trans people trying to discredit the individual experiences of other people like themselves.

It is toxic to believe or think that you need to have dysphoria to be trans, because of people like me, that delayed my transition for almost 11 years because of that very sentiment.
When you oppose the idea of something that represents the struggles of many individuals, you're falling into the same intransigent pattern that causes intolerance to begin with.

Being trans isn't some definable thing. It's when you don't fit into the tentpoles of gender conformity that society has built for you.
It doesn't take a permanent life altering decision to transform your appearance and experience life as the opposite gender.
Most boys only need to wear makeup to school *once* and suddenly they will be pressed through laughter on whether they are queer or trans.
What defines that which is male or female is so incredibly fragile, that in showing the slightest interest in that which is deemed *the other* gender leads your parents to freak out or disown you. Great news though! By associating with the trans community you may find security, no matter how you feel in your gender identity, you will be accepted, and that's part why the trans identity exists. Not because we belong to some futuristic and newly invented gender, but because we're men, women or neither, and society disallows us to take our place where we rightfully belong, always forcing us into one or the other.

No person should ever be urged away from transition if they ever approach the idea on their own accord. They themselves are the proof that they are trans, and if they feel differently later, that's perfectly fine, and is not the end of the line. Please recognize that being trans is not difficult or an uphill battle because being yourself is complicated, it isn't! It's complicated because we're constantly having to prove our own validity to people around us, if it weren't for that, we wouldn't be trans. We would just be the most authentic version of ourselves, no weight from societal expectations or norms. I would be a woman, you would be who you are and things would be a lot simpler.

We need binaries like trans to explain that 1 and 0 are indeed the biological variations of birth sex, but not the entire picture. You and I both know that a system that goes up to 2 still contains the base biology (1 and 0), yet a new binary, being the social aspect that needs to be accounted for.

And I've never really known how to deal with it, so I just push it down try to forget and move on. I ended up doing the wrong things trying to cope with it(drinking, porn, etc.) I've dealt with most of my demons in a quest to try and become a better person in my eyes.

1. My first issue is that I can‚Äôt seem to figure out how to create the illusion of breast in a bikini. I am a cis-gender female competitive bikini athlete, but after losing 50 lbs, I have been left with absolutely no breast tissue. You can see some development in my pectoral muscles, but there‚Äôs no fat or tissue around the nipples. My chest looks like that of a person who was biologically male at birth. There‚Äôs nothing to ‚Äúpush up‚Äù. And when I use silicone inserts, they weigh the bikini down. I tried using pillow stuffing as well, but it looks ridiculous. Does anyone have any devices or tricks I can use to create the illusion of bust in a swimsuit?

2. I‚Äôm so torn about getting breast implants. I‚Äôve heard that with developed pectoral muscles, you can be in chronic pain due to pressure on the implants. I‚Äôve also heard they look weird and distort if you flex. Has anyone had that experience? I‚Äôm just trying to get peoples opinion on the ‚Äúunder the muscle‚Äù implants. 

3. I was told by a surgeon I should not have ‚Äúover the muscle‚Äù implants because I had too little breast tissue. Has anyone without any natural breast existing prior gotten over the muscle implants? Did they look okay? Basically just wondering how the experience of ‚Äúover the muscle‚Äù implants are for someone who‚Äôs flat chested. 

4. If there‚Äôs anyone who identifies as female and has no breast tissue and is okay with this, what made that possible? Without clothes I feel deformed, and not like a ‚Äúreal girl‚Äù. If any female who doesn‚Äôt have breasts but feels confident in her body has any sort of insight into this I would appreciate it.

Dear ((RA's name)),

I apologize for using the 17th floor restroom. I was not aware you had a policy for restroom users. Of course I will honor your wish, as it is your floor's bathroom and not mine. However, I would like to explain a few things and hopefully clear up any misunderstandings.

I live on the 15th floor, a woman's floor, as I said before. I usually use the men's bathroom in public, but I am a transgender man, so I feel safer showering in a women's room in case anyone sees me naked. Using the 17th restroom is also much more convenient than going downstairs to use the restroom. I have never had a problem with my RA or any female residents on my floor, and I frequently see ((the Community Mentor, aka her boss)) in your restroom and she is always friendly and has never told me to leave. You said only residents can use the bathroom, but if that were the case, guests would have to go all the way to the lobby, which doesn't seem realistic. I'm assuming you really meant that only women can use the restroom. In that case, my friend ((the best friend/ the resident of the floor)) would not be able to use the restroom since they are genderqueer, not a woman. If it were based on having female anatomy, then I would be allowed to use your restroom. You see my point?

Further, the person you mentioned who showered in your restroom (tall with blue hair) is a trans woman. She dresses in masculine clothes as a safety precaution. She was spending the night at ((the best friend/ the resident))'s dorm and had nowhere else to shower. She has never caused issues in the restroom or purposely disturbed residents. While she could have gone to the 16th floor ((a men's floor)) to shower, it would have been quite humiliating for her.

I completely understand that you saw me and her and assumed the worst. I assure you, our friend would not have given us the bathroom code if we were potential threats to the 17th floor residents. (My floor also uses the same code.)

I don't mean to write this as an argument; I was genuinely shocked and upset and simply wish to explain myself. I come from a queer background. I don't believe in bathrooms separated by sex, especially given the unique gender identities of myself and my friends. I believe separating sexes by bathrooms is part of the problem. It creates a social divide between sexes. But like I said, I understand that for the majority of society, cisgender/passing men are much more likely to sexually harass women, so your concern for the safety of your residents is valid and I will respect your space. Maybe someday, men will learn to respect women's bodies, and we will not have a reason for bathrooms to be separated by sex.

I hope to have sufficiently explained my side of the situation. If you are unclear on any of my points, or if you would like to talk more about transgender bathroom rules, ways to be conscious of transgender guests/residents, or any related topics, don't hesitate to text me.

Thank you for reading and best wishes,

((My name and phone number))

So I'm an 18 year old male and I just recently got into cross dressing. I absolutely love it and feeling like I'm a woman just makes me feel so good inside. Secretly I have always wanted to be a woman since I was young but just always dismissed it as just sexual fantasy and nothing else. However, since I started cross dressing and pretending to be a woman I feel like it is more of a reality than I ever thought. I have a few problems though. First being that I am unsure of what to do, whether to wait a while and maybe purse HRT or just stick my life out how I am. Secondly, I would never be able to tell anyone due to my own insecurities and therefore feel like if I were to ever go through with this then I would have to disconnect myself from my family even though I know they would accept me. Thirdly, even though I really would love to be a woman, I feel like if I ever did change my mind down the line and regret it then I wouldn't be able to go back to how I am now. Finally, I would also like to have kids of my own but as far as I am aware once you are on HRT for a while it is not possible. I really am unsure of whether to just keep privately cross dressing and stay as a male or pursue this.

Any help and advice on the matter would be greatly appreciated as I am just not sure what to think.",trans,Extremely confused and need help,1553206398.0,"{'created_utc': 1553181198, 'id': 'b3roqs', 'num_comments': 11, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""Hi all,\n\nSo I'm an 18 year old male and I just recently got into cross dressing.

I don't want that. I try to work out to gain muscle but I tire easily and have bad joints in places. My right leg and shoulder cause the most grief.

I like to experiment with myself because it makes me happy, but everyone else hates it. The worst part is my chest; I'm fairly well endowed and despise every minute of it. I want to bind but it's too expensive for me to justify. 

I think now maybe I'm transmasc because of my strong connection to the Marine and desire to be more masculine and muscular in appearance. I don't want to be perceived as a tiny, weak young woman who's too nice. I've done that for far too long already.
I love wearing black and green and camo printed things. I wear gothy makeup with dark contours and always cut my nails too short so they look like a man's. My hair is getting shorter. I cosplay as my favorite characters because they make me feel a little more like myself. I haven't cosplayed the Marine yet, but I hope I can someday, once I've got the skills to make his armour and accurately sculpt my face to look even just a little like him. I'll hopefully feel myself.

All my life I have always had the thought in the back of my head that my life would be better if I was born a woman and I honestly wish that I was. However, due to my own insecurities I do not know if I'd be able to muster up the courage to act on these feelings. But I have seriously been considering it recently and plan on speaking to a therapist to really lay things out in the near future. I just had a few questions related to being a MtF just in case I do decide to go through with it which I hope that I do. I know I can search this on Google, and believe me I have been relentlessly, but I just wanted advice and answers from the people that I can relate to.

1. How hard is it to get on HRT? I have seen some people say that they have been waiting almost a year.
2. I'm not sure if I would ever be able to bring myself to get SRS so what kind of effects does HRT have on your penis?
3. For my breasts I'd like to have a C cup at least so what size do breasts normally grow to on MtF's?
4. If my breasts were to not grow to my desired size then how much do implants generally cost to get to a C cup size?
5. Finally, do you guys have any recommendations on how to overcome this feeling that I would never be able to tell anyone about this and therefore not act upon on due to the fear of losing those around me? I know my parents would accept me as they have previously said no matter who or what you are we will always love you but I still feel like it would just be a lot for them to deal with. They are not transphobic by any means but I guess it is down to my own pessimism of always thinking of the worst outcome of each situation.

I‚Äôm not sure about having a penis. I take prescription medication which has practically slaughtered my libido. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm dominant, and that I don‚Äôt want to be penetrated. Sexuality is a bit weird for me, so I can‚Äôt say much in that department.

Things become muddled when I consider that my traumatic life has caused me to disassociate. Life feels like I‚Äôm behind a glass wall that I made to protect myself from the world. It‚Äôs hard to feel like I‚Äôm really somewhere, even though I may accept that I‚Äôm in a place. I deny myself of a lucid life, and instead live through like a dream.

I love short haircuts, my favorite being undercuts. I push my hair back to make my forehead look bigger, because I know that guys have larger foreheads.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure about having a penis. I take prescription medication which has practically slaughtered my libido. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm dominant, and that I don‚Äôt want to be penetrated. Sexuality is a bit weird for me, so I can‚Äôt say much in that department.\n\nThings become muddled when I consider that my traumatic life has caused me to disassociate. Life feels like I‚Äôm behind a glass wall that I made to protect myself from the world. It‚Äôs hard to feel like I‚Äôm really somewhere, even though I may accept that I‚Äôm in a place. I deny myself of a lucid life, and instead live through like a dream. It‚Äôs the most infuriating and frustrating feeling in the world, that I can‚Äôt simply be without distancing myself.\n\nCan someone please help me figure out my feelings?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Am I Transgender?

634,2019-03-24 03:03:03,b4rpkx,4,2,"Hello, r/trans


Trying to navigate the intricacies of gender is something I've tried hard to do ever since I was made aware and I'm trying my best to understand the hardships of acceptance many face, be it from themselves or others. And since (thankfully) awareness has been spreading, it's only right I should learn what I can to be more accommodating so we can all finally get along on this damn rock we all call home. So I come to you with a doozy (for me) of a question.



I have two friends, who are a couple, that I haven't spoken to in some time (adulthood and work keeping us busy in our own affairs and all that). Just recently I heard one of them (previously the girlfriend) has been going down transition road to become a male. They have changed their name, started hormone replacement, the whole shebang. 



Now again it has been a few years since I last saw either of them, and I am curious; do I acknowledge his previous identity and act as old friends, or try to act as though I am speaking to a new person? I know that sounds ignorant, and I'm leaning towards simply calling him by his new name, and just carrying on like we always have...but there's a part of me in the back of my mind that just says ""what if you're wrong, ICall_Bullshit?""


I don't want to go behind his back and see what other friends have done as I feel that is disrespectful and disingenuous. I would rather talk to him face to face, simply call them by their new name, just accept their new identity, and carry on. But does that feel as if I'm brushing off the transition?

Does it 100% mean that they are transitioning? 

Is there any other reason a teenage boy would take estrogen pills?

690,2019-03-26 02:10:22,b5jxqe,2,5,"God, I've got a lot to say tonight tbh.

&amp;#x200B;

So I came out at work as a guy on Sunday 24th. My boss took it super well and asked what name I'd like to use from now on, how soon I want them to use ""he/him/his"" and yeah, it went great! Yay! I'll be telling other colleagues when I go back in on Thursday this week as technically the boss I told is my OLD department boss and so I need to tell my new department boss and probably the store manager and blah blah blah, as well as the other colleagues who I interact with more often, haha. (I've just moved off bakery, which I've hated and has caused me stress for over a year!! and have moved onto checkouts only finally).

&amp;#x200B;

I've been going by Alex with friends for well over a month now, which is nice. I've started introducing myself as Alexander when I meet new people (I get tingles when they repeat my name back to me, it's great, even though a quarter of the time they look confused). I've joined a LGBTQ+ group on Wednesday evenings, and I'm starting some therapy for unrelated reasons on Wednesday mornings but yay I'm super happy about that so I thought I'd throw it in anyway lol. Like, this whole thing is super confusing, but living as a man and being referred to as a guy is just so satisfying and makes me insanely happy and almost giddy, haha. My sister even referred to me as her sibling the other day after accidentally calling me her sister, which was lovely of her; even if she can't say ""brother"" yet, the fact that she's trying is incredible cause we've always been super close and I suppose this will affect it in some way, but it's nice to see that it shouldn't be a huge deal.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also starting trans-specific counselling on a Thursday evening in a month or two hopefully too. I'm still waiting on a call back, but fingers crossed it's sooner rather than later.

&amp;#x200B;

Umm, I think I mentioned before that I've told my parents. They won't use my pronouns or new name right now cos they're scared they'll slip up in front of the extended family, who don't know anything just yet. I'll be sitting them down for a talk after I've been to a Gender Identity Clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently living as a man, been binding every day for about 3+ weeks (don't worry, not for more than 7 hours a day; I put it on before work, take it off after when I get home... I just can't stand wearing a bra or really many obviously women's clothes anymore :( ... I have to tonight for a gig and I'm dreading it, help) Anyway. I've got new name badges printed at work, I'm out to my family and friends though my extended family doesn't know as we almost know they'll either tell me I'm deranged or try to convince me out of it or something, Idk. Like I said, I'll be talking to them about that properly after a first GIC appointment and some advice, haha. Might take mum along to my appointment when I get one, actually, cause you can take a trusted family member and I think it'd be easier for her to hear from a professional who knows what they're talking about rather than a 23 year old armed only with Internet knowledge.

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to my questions, I guess:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do I need to be referred by my GP for a Gender Identity Clinic appointment? 
2. Does anyone in the UK know if there's a clinic in the South West that isn't all the way down in Devon?
3. Is there usually a waiting list? 
4. Does living as my preferred gender for any length of time speed up the process at all? 
5. I've documented when I've come out and to who, as well as a couple other things such as my specific personal dysphoria; will that help? 
6. What questions should I definitely ask?
7. I know I need to do a blood test when I get there, or before; what do they actually look for?
8. I'm overweight, will that change anything at all negatively? I've been working out every morning and trying to eat better, don't have diabetes or any health conditions due to my weight besides asthma, so I'm hoping that'll help a little.

&amp;#x200B;

I think that's it. I've just obviously never been through this, so I'm not too sure what these appointments look for/do or how to even go about getting an appointment, etc.

709,2019-03-27 01:29:04,b5y9kl,11,2,"I'm 18 and closeted &amp; I knew I was trans since I was around 15.
Recently I've been kinda doubting myself. Thinking I'm not ""trans enough"" or that my dysphoria isnt strong enough or worth transitioning for. I try to think of my life in the future where i live as a woman, and its honeslty pathetic and sad. It gives me no emotion, just emptiness and maybe regret. My future as a guy is obviously much happier. I also wonder what if im not dysphoric but im actually having body dysmorphia? (Ill get into that later)

Basically I am searching for a weak ass excuse to 'not really be trans' and give up on it just cause I'm scared of my parents and everyone i know not accepting me



Okay, little childhood flashbacks. When I was little I was quite ""androgynous"" in behaviour (id play with blocks, id draw, id play with insects, but id also let my mom put me into dresses (i didnt care about clothes much)) &amp; also I remember when i was 9 i was REALLY against playing with barbies cause those were girl toys. My mom got me some and id play with them in secret, embarrassed if anyone even saw me near them. My brother got a ken doll once and i kept on stealing him because i was jealous. (Idk i just find that story interesting)
Anyways i always considered myself ""a tomboy"" compared to other girls in my class. I acted more tough and strong and hated appearing feminine or anything like that. Around the age of 13 i started addressing myself as a guy online (it all started cause i wanted to catfish... as a guy?? Dont ask, i dont know) and i found a name that i quite liked. I... still use that name online. Its a name i grew up with, literally. Ive been using it for 5 years or more. I'm trying to keep this short but im failing. Im just ranting now. Anyways.

I found out im trans when i actually found out about trans people. I remember reading about what they are and what they feel like and i was thinking ""no that is not me""... i ended up doing online quizzes (i know thats a bad resource but i was desperate) and praying u dont get the results of me being trans (i did) This was during the time when i was calling myself a guy online too. After school ended i cut my hair and started binding once i got into high school.
Now i dont know is it because of my appearance or age but in middle school i was always more quiet and laid back, shy... but after my mini transformation i became confident. I was digging looking like a dude, and i even took more than 3 selfies (before i used to think selfies were something girls did and id be caught dead taking selfies... tbh i still think that. I just never see guys taking selfies at school)

Now onto my dysphoria. I think I have both body and social dysphoria. When I'm home i dont bind (i wear a sports bra) mainly bc i bind for 6 hours at school every day and at home i like to lay a lot (&amp; laying in a binder is not comfortable AT ALL). Before this, i never had any issues with my body. But i think dysphoria kinda triggered some body dysmorphia. I can difference them. I started getting dysmorphic when i realized that my thighs arent as thin as cis guys thighs, or that my waist isnt as straight as a cis guys, or how most cis guys have a slim face... basically i think me losing weight would make me more of a guy. But theres a part of me that doubts this and thinks that once i lose weight i wont feel any problems and ""wont be trans"". It probably sounds stupid. I also got bullied for my weight in middle school (it didnt affect me though, no one bullies me now). 
I am dysohoric about my body. The way i walk, talk, my voice is feminine/androgynous and not masculine, i have a baby face, my chest isnt flat / its too big, my hands are small, i dont have natural testosterone muscle, my thighs and hips arent masculine, i should wear a shoe size bigger etc... but sometimes when i come out of the shower or get dressed, my thoughts are blank about my body. I dont like it. I just... suck it up. Thats what i always do. Suck it up and avoid the problem in hopes of it going away. When i get misgendered by strangers i feel bad and sulk and wonder what about me ""gave it away""? But i get misgendered daily by friends and family (im not out) and i always suck it up or ignore it. But because i managed to ignore the problem for so long i started to think i could do this. Forever. Pretend like me talking about myself or others adressing me with the wrong pronouns doesnt bother me. I try not to talk about myself or try to find a way where i word my sentence and dont mention any pronouns.

It feels kind of really pathetic. I should also mention that my parents kinda found out im trans when i was 16, thought i was going through a phrase and sent me to a psychologist (who didnt help) but then completely avoided and ignored the issue after that. They think its their fault. My friends kinda know, but I never asked them to use the right pronouns (since im not out to everyone).

Whenever i go through reddit and see all these trans people who came out and got on hormones, or went to a therapist, changed their name etc, just got to be themselves, i get really sad. Like okay they got lucky but i wont. I just dont see a bright future and dont think its worth it. Im not suicidal but death sometimes sounds way better than disappointing my parents and not having support. If i had supportive parents i think my story wouldve headed a different direction. I hope to one day actually transition and get on hormones, but what if I'm making a bad choice? What if my life falls apart and my parents get scolded by other people because of me? What if they lose their jobs? What if i realize this isnt right for me? What if my problems fade in two years? I'm just in a tough spot right now.

Im finishing high school this year, then maybe ill have to move to go to college. But im not sure. I hoped to start college as who i am, but that probably wont happen.

I'm going to be honest, I am ... really ashamed of this. It's hard for me to talk about. It's hard for me to admit. And Goddamn, it's hard for me to share on a subreddit full of trans people and allies.

I ... am trying to be an ally, but I fucking suck at it ... It's hard to talk about, so I'm going to keep this brief because I'm already crying, but long story short, anything transgender makes me feel ... awful. Like, the feeling to me is akin to walking through a thick mass of cobwebs. Both terrifying and gross feeling. I've gotten better about acknowledging the transition/preferred pronouns of my online friends (though it's still uncomfortable, for me I've gotten to a feeling of say it, cringe, and move on), but my best friend/roommate/practically a sister to me (MtF) came out online a few months ago and is now taking little steps to transition in real life, too (came out to her parents, bought a purse and some jeans today).

She actually asked me to come with her to go clothes shopping on Sunday (for the trip today). Unintentionally, my first response was to panic and say, ""You know, physically, those won't fit you correct? Either the hips will be too big, or the legs will be too short."" I felt bad about it afterward, but I panicked and spat out what, logically, I thought the answer would be. Afterwards we hashed it out and I explained I just wasn't comfortable on a trip like that, but it made me start to question if my discomfort was selfish or not. 

I grew up in a Conservative Christian household that doesn't hate LGBTQ people, per se, but doesn't encourage it, either. Still, I didn't have *too* terrible a problem when another friend of mine came out as gay, or my online friends came out as trans. But now that she's wanting to spend time with me in public as a she scares and makes me more uncomfortable than calling her she physically ... Part of the problem is I have harm OCD (an OCD type where you're constantly worried about causing harm to others) and part of me wonders if the fear feeling I get is due to that (I'm afraid I'll offend all the other Conservative Christians by walking around with a currently-physically male person holding a purse)?

Part of it is probably an ego/image thing, but there's another part of it I can't write off so easily that is really, really bothering me. Again, that cobwebby feeling.  The disgusted/wrong feeling that makes me curl away like someone's vomited at my feet every time it's mentioned. That feeling might stem from my religious background, but it's also sounds similar to what a disgust OCD was described to me as (the feeling, after being in a trigger's presence, that makes you want to wipe your entire body down with a sanitizing wipe and remove your clothes so you can wash them). 

That, or maybe I'm just a fucking closet bigot trying to fool myself, and always will be an absolute bitch. Who knows? 

I just don't know what to do. I want to be happy for her and helpful and supportive, but even writing ""her"" right now makes me want to scream or gag. I just don't get what's wrong with me.

So my boyfriend and I just ended up leaving a group chat today thanks to some toxic as shit jerks. So someone in this chat just casually deadnamed one of our friends. My bf called the dude out on it and the dude laughed about it. Excused it because ""that's just how I call them.""

This kind of really pissed off my boyfriend. Like, the just refusal to see what he was doing. So they got into a massive argument. The dude just would not admit any fault or anything. So my bf called them an asshole and a garbage person (accurate). The group ended up turning on my bf and called him an asshole for not being respectful and ""listening to the other side"".

The trans guy that was being talked about didn't involve himself in the conversation. I think he's sick of fighting people on his name or anything and that breaks my heart if I'm honest. My boyfriend is trying to urge them that they need to speak up for themselves but I don't see it happening. He just figures that when he looks male enough people will come around and I just...ugh. I get the mindset but I think you have to be your biggest advocate or everyone will walk all over you.

I don't get it. And I especially don't get the people insisting my boyfriend is making a big deal out of nothing. Like, he just doesn't want to see someone purposefully calling his friend by his deadname. I don't see how that makes him an asshole or uncivil. They act like he started the whole thing and refuse to see that deadnaming someone is shit behaviour.

I'm just so done with people right now. Except him...like, I'm so happy he spoke up. I just don't understand why nobody else did. He tried to vent to other people afterwards and their responses weren't much better. He wasn't using names so I fail to see why people think he was just ""spreading drama"".

Apparently that's unacceptable because my chosen name, Dominic, apparently doesn't fit. My last name is very Polish, and they say Dominic is far too Italian to pair with my Polish last name. It's so funny to me because my birth name was Stephanie, which is freaking GREEK. But apparently that's acceptable lmao. It's like these baby boomers will latch on to anything they can to prove to themselves that my transition is a bad idea. 

They ask why I don't just pick something easier and derivative, like Stephan or Steve. When I say they missed the boat on the naming game they get all offended, like I should have asked for their blessing. My friends and family have been calling me Dominic for a year, and my mother, the woman who named me when I was born, personally approved of my new name. My wife loves it, my mother loves it, my grandmother loves it, and my siblings love it.

Too bad for you, coworker dudes. Get with the times. I'll be lenient with their lack of effort up until the exact minute I get my legal gender marker and name changed, at which point their options will be A) treat me with respect and use my legal name and pronouns, or B) watch me slam you with a discrimination lawsuit.

I've never really tried coming onto an online community to talk about this stuff. I don't really know the terminology about these topics well, so please forgive me if I sound ignorant or vague.

I was born a male and would like to know how to go about logically transitioning from male to female.

I was heavily invested in this idea since I was small, watching cartoons, I was extremely interested in certain gimmicky episodes where there was a ""gender bender"" trope. It intrigued me to see what the other side was like.

At first, it was merely faint, and I did not really know what it meant. The ideas were further perpetuated by my discovery of ""transformation"" fetish on Youtube and DeviantArt. It became a guilty pleasure that I masturbated to since I was in elementary school. No one really knew, and my parents thought it wasn't strange for a growing ""boy"", never checking my interests or watch history.

The idea only grew more as I graduated elementary school. Around this time, I kind of grew an awakening towards the world, and was very paranoid of the future, my future to be exact. All the while, I had kept those feelings bottled within me. The period between middle school and high school was a depressing time.

I eventually came out to my parents, who were accepting of the idea, but didn't really know how to help me.

I never really tried crossdressing or trying on women's clothes, except for one time as a child. I also never talked to an online community or researched into the idea more than just fantasizing about it.

&amp;#x200B;

We don't go out as a ""family"" that often so it's not a super huge occurrence, which is kind of nice.

&amp;#x200B;

But the issue I have when going out with them is the name they use when referring to me. I'm MTF and my ""preferred"" name is Megan, but my legal/dead name/the name they use is totally different, and not feminine.

&amp;#x200B;

It just makes me feel super awkward when we're in public and they say something as simple as ""was that nice X"".

&amp;#x200B;

They know I'm trans, but they're not super supportive, my dad is pretty bad. Which is why I never say anything. My mum is fairly understanding but she's got a while to go I think. She'll come around some day. 

&amp;#x200B;

We just went out for dinner and I kinda feel a lot of ""meh"" thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

I remember when I went out shopping with a friend once and she called me Megan all the time, that was great.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though I didn't wear any makeup today so I probably wouldn't have totally passed (I know you don't ""need"" to pass) anyway, it still made me feel weird. If I did ""pass"" and they called me X and someone overheard they probably would think twice and reconsider me ""passing"".

&amp;#x200B;

There was a guy that kept glancing at me, I don't know what his deal was. That didn't make things any better, he was sat pretty close so chances are he overheard. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's just really awkward when me and my parents go out in public.

Sorry for ranting about this, I don't like ranting a lot but if anyone has any advice or just wants to share their experience with this that would be great.

1) You have to get a document from a doctor/psychiatrist

2) You go to trans-specified clinic and start examinations for diagnosis

3) If you get the diagnosis for transgenderism, state provides you HRT, hair removal, voice training and possible surgery and legal change of gender.

I'm starting to develop facial hair on my upper lip, and body hair on my lower abdomen and chest. I thought that I could just wait until I graduated high school to transition, but I can't do this. I'm in my Junior year, but I won't turn 18 until 2021. If I let Testosterone continue to ravage my body, I'll have course facial hair by the time I graduate.

I know what I need to do. I've been doing research on hrt for the last 6 months, and I think I'm going to self medicate. I know it's not the best option, but I can't do this anymore. If I continue to develop into a man,  I'm going to kill myself. I know that sounds dark, but this is my reality.

Transitioning is a matter of life and death for me.


I fully understand the risks that come with self medicating, and I'm willing to accept it. I've taking advanced Chemistry, Biology, and I understand how this medication will interact with my body.

I would be taking Spironolactone and Estradiol. Starting with low dose of Spiro, and raising it for a month. Then starting on a low dose of Estrogen. If. You want to know my treatment plan in detail, look at my post history.

I know that taking Estrogen will increase the fat in my blood. I don't smoke, and I run cross country. My height is 5' 11"" and my weight is 140lbs. So I'm planning on staying active to reduce the risk of complications.

I know that cypro is better than Spironolactone, but I've heard it can cause depression-like symptoms. I'm taking lexipro for depression, so I don't want to mess with that.

I also know that hrt will make me infertile. And I don't care. It would be nice to be able to bank my sperm, but I have no access to that as I minor.

I'm sorry if this bummed you out, but I really need some advice. If you can't, then I would really appreciate some support. I'm just really scared.

First of all I'm very happy this subreddit exists. I'm overjoyed the work 'genderqueer' exists! 

I've really been struggling over the question 'am I trans?'. I even started to go to a doctor to start that transition, but haven't followed through starting anything for various reasons.

I'm afab, but I don't want to be a man. But I understand that I'm not what I define as a woman.  I sing and have a very wide range, I can go into baritone up to  second soprano. I'm busty and curvy, but handsome. I want to grow a beard, I already have a goatee. 
I'm strong, I'm soft. I... Just feel like I'm a blend of what are supposed to be my two gender options and it makes it impossible for me to put all of me into one box.

I feel my best option is to carve my own path and be my queerest self. I just realize it will look strange to the general binary public. I'm writing this seeking advice from those who are boldly expressing themselves and how that's been in life, I suppose!

It's badly overdue for tidying up now. I want a somewhat feminine looking haircut, but have no idea how easy that would be to get.

I used to go to a great queer-friendly gender-neutral barbers in my old city, and I could rock up in a skirt, tell them I was genderqueer and they would give me exactly the haircut I wanted, make it work with my beard and everything was lovely. Then I moved to a new place and despite trying to explain what I wanted my first haircut was so aggressively masc that I couldn't look in the mirror for a couple of weeks without triggering dysphoria. 

I'm also on the autism spectrum, and the social navigation involved in getting a femme haircut as an AMAB from a standard salon has me a bit stumped.

Wondering if anyone has experience around this and would be able to offer advice. I'm in the UK if that's relevent.

* I know I want a hair salon, not a barbers - would a ""ladies"" salon mind cutting my hair, or should I look for an explicitly unisex one?

* Should I expect to pay the women's price or the men's price? I want to pay the women's price, because I want exactly the service that they would give to a woman, but would it be weird if I suggest that?

* Am I more likely to get the haircut I want if I temporarily shave off my beard?

* I was thinking of asking ""imagine I was a woman growing out her hair from a pixie cut, what styles would you recommend?"" Does that sound like a good approach?

* I live in a small town - would I be better off traveling to the nearest big city for this?

Wrong, I know, but there isn't much I can do about that now. For four years I went through phases of trying to be extremely sexy and feminine/not giving a shit about what I looked like and wearing track pants and hoodies. I did enjoy being girly at times, but sometimes it made me feel like I was dressing in drag (I'm sorry if that sounds offensive, I don't know how else to say it...) 

A year after our daughter was born I felt like something clicked in me. I realized that the only way to truly be ME is to be like I was all through my teenage years, until I met my boyfriend - androgynous/leaning towards the masculine side. I used to bind, wore exclusively men's clothes and had very short hair. I actually thought that I was trans at one point but I don't think so anymore, at least not 100%. My boyfriend knows I was boyish back then but he doesn't know any details.

I have chest dysphoria and hips/butt/thighs dysphoria, some days are worse than others. I use tight sports bras and they help but not enough. I wear androgynous/boyish clothes and I have short hair. I've stopped shaving and I only wear enough makeup to hide my dark circles. I'm so much more comfortable now, but I know my boyfriend doesn't like it, even though he says he still loves me. He keeps going on and on about my beautiful long hair and all the dresses I used to wear. He said that he feels like I cheated him, because I've changed so much and that I'm going through a crisis or something and that he doesn't get why people have to change, he's been the same all his life.

I feel miserable, I feel like I'm doing wrong to my boyfriend and I'm afraid it's going to make him fall out of love with me and leave, I love him and our family more than anything. But  at the same time I feel like this change is something I NEED to do, I feel so much better about myself already even though I haven't had the courage to go full androgynous/masculine yet. I'm kind of holding on to the last feminine parts of me for him... But I don't think I can do it forever.

How can I feel better in this situation? Or is it even right for me to feel better, what if this ends up breaking our family? All because of me suddenly turning into a guy (like my boyfriend put it)?

When I was little I always wanted to play the female character in games and sometimes act out the female character in role play in real life. Despite this I also role played as male characters in real life and was happy with that. I used to want to shave like my dad and I also used to want to put a towel on my head like my my Mum (like a woman) I knew I was a boy and I never questioned it, yet sometimes I would daydream about what it would be like to be a girl. Yet still, I never thought I was a girl if that makes sense. I played with the girls at school but also played with guys. 
I remember my sister and her friends dressing me up as a girl and I felt all pretty but didn‚Äôt feel that much different? I also never felt wrong in boy clothes. I remember being at a birthday party full of girls and I was the only little boy there, and I remember just thinking it was normal for a little boy to play with little girls, and after the party we got goody bags and I got a boy one and they got girl ones but I wasn‚Äôt jealous I was just like oh cool whatever? 
It was like I was genderless. 
So fast forward to puberty when I realize I‚Äôm gay and begin to hide it, I feel an immense change in me lots of anxiety etc, but no issues with my body or puberty at all - to this day I‚Äôm very comfortable with my body and facial hair etc. 
When I picture myself in the future I picture myself as a man, yet my mind keeps saying but what if you‚Äôre a woman. 
I‚Äôve also gone to a gender therapist and she has hinted that I have OCD because of things I did in the past, we‚Äôve also agreed I call myself just a person. 
I‚Äôve tried on eye makeup and it didn‚Äôt do anything to me and when I made myself a skirt to try on I just felt like a man in a skirt. 
I had a dream a few months ago were my friend was like ‚Äòoh you‚Äôre a woman, and a man‚Äô I also had a dream where I had long hair and I remember not liking it in the dream.
I literally feel like I don‚Äôt fit in anywhere. 
So I have no issues with my body, what I do have issues with is how I want to present and label myself.

I'm just discovering that I'm somewhere in the genderqueer world--trans and enby feel like validating terms, and so I'm trying to own them and own my identity. For 38 years...I didn't do that. Finally, this year, I came out to myself.

Initially, I thought my wife of four years was understanding, but it seems she doesn't quite ""get"" what all of this means. She's afraid she's not going to like ""what I become."" At first, she would say things like, ""men in the 16th century used to wear frilly clothes and high heels..."" I think it was a rationalization to her that I was still essentially masculine, that I just liked to wear cute things. She'd be like, ""that's cool, I like to wear cute things too."" I felt like I just couldn't get through to her. I would have to correct her that I don't want to dress like a man from *any* era. I really want to express my feminine traits in some way.

I tried explaining it more to her. She's read things on enbies--good info, too. But she just doesn't *get it.* And I said, ""I don't get it either a lot of the time."" She doesn't understand how confused I feel about this stuff, how I waver between denial and acceptance.

When I told my therapist yesterday, she was so supportive and happy for me. She knew how much shit I've dealt with my whole life, and encouraged me to try to ""lean in"" to my enby-ness. I have, and while it's been a lot of ups and downs, I know that this is something I'm going to explore until I really understand who I am.

And that's the problem: I'm kind of sad to say it, but I just don't think this is gonna be able to happen in this relationship. I understand that she's confused and worried that she won't like ""what I turn into,"" but that can't determine whether or not I go through this transition (and it *is* a transition of sorts). I need a space to explore myself, and I know that I'm not going to be able to do that with someone who tries to one-up me and make it a competition about who is going through more shit right now. I mention this because she recently said that it's a lot to deal with, and I said that it's actually 1000x worse for me. I'm also a college student in an honors program, and I've got a Spanish final and an 8 page paper due on Monday, an essay-quiz due tonight, and a spring break which will no doubt be filled with a lot of isolation and heartache.

I don't know what I'm expecting from this post. I talked to a trans family member today who made me feel *so good* about all this stuff, and then I met my wife and it's like...

You are deeply ashamed of who you are. Because you‚Äôre not supposed to be like this. You were assigned a gender, and nobody told what to do if it didn‚Äôt fit, if none of them did. 

You look desperately for people like you, for anyone who can tell you that it‚Äôs ok, that you are normal and valid. And when you find them you dare only look. And what you see is only differences. And you feel fake.

Even as you start to tell others the shame remains. Even when those you tell accept you there are people you will never tell. Because how can they possibly understand? How can they possibly accept something you haven‚Äôt? How can anything ever be the same? 

And you think that you will always be alone, even though you have friends. Because who could ever love a person who doesn‚Äôt love themselves. And the doubt, it isolates you. And the doubt, it consumes you.

You start taking steps to be who you are. You change your presentation and you start to feel proud of your progress. Yet you still hide, even from yourself.

here is me: http://imgur.com/dTLy79I

as you can see, my face is very round, fat, and feminine. i am 6ft tall. i feel like any haircut i get will make me look like a butch lesbian. (i do like girls, but i'd really really really rather look androgynous-masculine-ish than lesbianish.)

i've got a few i think might work, but this is my first time. it will be done without telling my family in advance, so i can't ask for their help. (when i was 15, i tried for short hair, but again, my mom said i'd look like a butch lesbian. not what i wanted then, either.)

I‚Äôm AFAB, and I have a few fitness goals vis a vis gender presentation - but mostly I‚Äôm curious what other people are doing fitness-wise to claim ownership of their nice genderqueer bodies. 

My goals:
- femme+strong ass and strong legs. Via strength training
- low bf and no breasts lol - I know you can‚Äôt spot reduce but I can dream
- posture and carriage of elite level male athletes - Usain Bolt for example.  I want that easy, relaxed straight-spine posture, arm-swinging confidence.  Also I feel like my breastbone is sunken and I‚Äôd like to work on thrusting it upwards.  I think I slouch in order to hide my breasts :/

What I‚Äôm doing:
-training for a half-marathon - focusing a lot on form and hoping it‚Äôll help with posture 
- sprints and high intensity training to boost T
- basic strength training (squats, single legged deadlifts, lunges and power cleans mostly) for that lower body - focusing on form and visualizing myself as Bolt üòÖ to help with subtle posture cues 
-pull up bar - mostly for my ego
-some upper body strength for balance and posture

164,2019-03-30 03:59:10,b76tsh,5,11,"Hey all! I've never posted here before, but I've got a kind of funny (and for me, brutally embarrassing) story about trying to schedule a haircut at a salon. Actually, I'm still reeling from the embarrassment, so I figured I'd post here to 1) entertain y'all and 2) vent.

The area I live in is pretty conservative and isn't very pro-LGBTQ--I don't think anyone here would hate you if you were gay, but they're definitely less understanding of less well-known identities (like being genderqueer). However, there's a college town about 40 minutes from where I live that's pretty progressive, so I looked up a list of LGBTQ-friendly salons in that area and decided to try booking a haircut.

Background info about me: after over a year of gender confusion and questioning, I'm pretty comfortable identifying as non-binary/genderqueer/transmasculine. Because I'm not firmly FTM, though--or at least, I don't think I am--I've got a good deal of impostor syndrome, especially when it comes to telling people how I identify. (I'm sure y'all know how it is. *Genderqueer* is harder to explain to most people than just *trans guy or gal,* and sometimes the idea of having to explain myself makes me doubt my identity a little.)

Anyway, partly thanks to my current hairstyle, no one really sees me as a transmaculine/genderqueer dude. (Obviously, I'm trying to change that with a new haircut.) I should also add that, because of the whole transmasculine thing, I'm aiming to be read as male and not female. In fact, it's gotten to the point where I wonder if maybe I'm just a guy, period--but that's another story, so I won't go into that here. Point being, I'm genderqueer and looking to present as male/masculine.

So, I found this LGBTQ-friendly salon, *and* I found out that they have online booking--which is a double score, because I hate talking to people on the phone. When I was booking an appointment, though, the site asked me to sign up for either a women's haircut or a men's haircut. I knew that effort-wise my hair qualified as a women's haircut, but in terms of style, I wanted to make sure I got a guy's haircut. Also, I know that for trans people, getting haircuts can be a harrowing (hairowing?) experience, and I wanted to avoid any distress caused by someone trying to give me an androgynous women's cut or something.

Of course, I realized I could just suck it up: sign up for the women's cut, and when I get there, insist with all my might that I'm transmasculine, hoping that they haven't already decided my gender before I even walk through the door. But then I thought, hey! Why don't I email them first and ask?

Yeah, great idea.

(No, really, this was actually a great idea. Just...not-so-great execution.)

Again, my area--really, my state in general--is more conservative, so I was wary of saying that I was genderqueer. I didn't know if they'd understand what that meant, or if they'd associate it with something negative and write me off. And honestly, I'm still having trouble asserting my gender identity; rather than speak up and gently correct someone when they misgender me, I tend to just get pissed and say nothing. But for this haircut, this first step toward really presenting properly, I wanted to own my truth.

...own my truth in a way that did not *explicitly* say I was genderqueer, just in case that would hurt my chances of getting a haircut.

So I ended up writing something like, ""I'd like to get a men's haircut, but my legal gender is female, although I don't identify that way, etc., etc., how should I book the appointment?"" I read over the email, reworded it a few times, proofread it, and sent it to my sibling for a second set of eyes. Everything looked good. This was the perfect email! Satisfied, I sent it off, then spent the next six hours anxiously waiting for a response.

Around dinnertime, I got a very friendly email confirming that yes, because my hair would take longer to work with, I should technically sign up for a women's haircut. However, there was a spot where I could leave a note specifying that I identify as--as--

*Oh, no. What have I done?*

Ah, yes, friends. My first time owning my truth, but I...didn't quite own it. See, apparently the phrasing I used--where I said I wasn't female, but didn't specify what I actually *was*\--led them to believe that I was a trans guy. The last part of their email (about how I could attach a note to my appointment) was telling me to leave a note so that the salon knew I identify as male.

Now, maybe this isn't as simultaneously amusing/horrifying to y'all as it was to me, but oh, was my face red when I read that email. I never considered the possibility that they would automatically assume I was FTM--though in hindsight, what *else* would they assume? Like, man, I really walked into that one. 

So then, of course, I was tasked with the incredibly awkward process of emailing the salon again to try to explain that *no, I'm not technically male...well, yes, I'm definitely more male than female. Actually, have you heard of being genderqueer? Because if you have, then this is really awkward, because I could've just mentioned this to begin with. Uh, actually, I just think I'll try the next salon on the list.*

Okay, so I didn't write that, exactly. However, I did feel really embarrassed and stupid writing that clarification email. I mean, maybe they don't even care how I identify. Maybe that was TMI. And they were so nice and understanding that I hated to ""correct"" them, especially with something that makes a lot less sense than just *trans guy.* 

Then again, if I didn't email them back, I was worried there would be some confusion if the ""guy"" who just emailed them then turned around and booked an appointment as *gender: other.* So, I sucked it up and sent them the awkward email.

Of course, part of me is laughing at all of this, because this is exactly the sort of thing I would do. It wouldn't be the first time I've put my foot in my mouth and given someone the wrong idea about me. On the other hand, now my impostor syndrome is through the roof. I keep thinking that maybe I'm faking being under the trans umbrella, or that I'm wrong and confused, or that I don't deserve to assert myself as transmasculine or genderqueer, et cetera, et cetera.

That's all wrong, of course. I know I'm valid. Lurking on this sub (and texting my sibling 100 times in the past three hours) has taught me that much. Still, this was...not the start I wanted for my first men's haircut, lmao.

Anyway, I just wanted to share this story with y'all because I thought it was funny in a slightly horrible way. Of all the things I imagined going wrong when I tried to book a haircut, this didn't even cross my mind. But I mean, hey, at least I'll be getting my men's haircut. 

And let this be an inspirational message to you all that there *are* accommodating salons out there...even if you accidentally request the wrong kind of accommodations.

Any sort of physical activity, wether its walking through the hallways in class or going up and down the stairs leave me completely breathless. Once after about eight hours of wearing the binder a part in my chest was starting to feel a bit numb. Is this normal? See, it feels close to how uncomfortable binding with bandages is, and one of the main reasons i got a binder was because I thought it would be much more comfortable. I‚Äôve asked my friend if they feel like this after they bind and they said that its normal for chest binders to be like that, but i want a second opinion.

Some background: I recently found out I was aromantic, it introduced me to a lot of new terms and ideas, and decided to look more into the gender part.

Present day, I consider myself to have both a balance between a masculine and feminine mentality. I‚Äôve recently becoming a lot more curious about cross dressing, and whenever I wear super girly clothes I feel so uncomfortable. However, this is where the non binary/agender part comes into play.

21,2019-03-04 18:58:03,axatnk,3,1,"Hi all, 24-year-old AMAB here. Pretty much what it says in the title; I'm fluctuating a lot between feeling as though I'm just a cis guy or a trans woman. I know I don't want to transition, but I keep asking myself if that's because I physically don't want to, or if I'm just scared of it. Because I *am* scared of it. Like, terrified. I talked to a friend of mine about it for the first time the other day (cis guy) and he told me that it seemed like I was ""scared of losing control of my own narrative,"" which seems pretty accurate. 

It's like, when I get dysphoric (which I am now) I experience it almost as an alien thing trying to take over my body. It doesn't feel like a part of me so much as it does someone holding a gun to my head and being like ""you better transition or this is never going to go away. You're never going to be happy."" But I don't feel like a girl, and I don't identify with a lot of ""girly"" things. I've lurked the MtF subreddit and always felt kind of wigged out, or out of sync with them. I don't want to wear dresses (I don't think) or be overtly feminine. It's like, if I was a girl I would be a tomboy or even butch. I'm 6' 1'' and don't relate at all to the common refrain of wanting to be ""small and cute;"" I love being tall and sometimes wish I was taller. What I *do* like about being a girl, though, is the sensitivity, and especially the feeling of ""innate value."" I feel like women have an innate value, while men don't; they are only valued by what they do. I want to be treasured, cherished, desired. I feel like, as a guy, others don't treat me with an innate worth in the same way (I feel like this might run counter to a lot of women's lived experiences, but I figured I should put it in just the same). 

And then I'll go through periods where I love being a man and pretty much everything about it. I'll go ""bro out"" with my friends and love it, love being a big dumb guy, love being strong, etc. I love watching shit like BroScienceLife (I know, I know) and just generally interacting with others in a masculine way. At times like that it almost feels like it was someone totally different who was lurking these subs, and I'll be like ""wtf was I doing lol?"" 

In both ""modes"" (although it's more of a continuum than discrete frames) the other one feels weird and I'll come up with rationalizations for why I felt that way. When I'm feeling dysphoric, all of my masculine stuff feels like a mask, and when I'm not dysphoric I tend to assign my ""feminine"" identifying features to my profound discomfort at being a ""sensitive"" man (I come from a family with pretty strict gender roles and a lot of negativity towards femininity in general, from both men and women).

I found this sub and was like, ""holy shit that's me,"" but it wasn't long before I read about people who used ""genderfluid"" as a stepping stone because they didn't feel comfortable identifying as binary trans, and I got depressed again. I read about trans women who regret not transitioning sooner and I feel like, if this is going to end in transitioning I better get it over with. I don't want to deal with this at all--I'd much rather clear the dysphoria on the male side than be a female--but since I can't ignore it I want to take steps to fix it as soon as possible. Even though I know that's probably not possible :/

Anyway, thanks for reading. I know that nobody here can read my mind and tell me what to do, but it makes me feel better that yall are here and I'm not alone in working through this. 

PS: It's probably noteworthy that I've only experienced overt dysphoria for like, the past six months, although I can think of a few times in my past when I said or thought about things in what I might retroactively consider dysphoria.

Due to a strict lifestyle I didn't find out I was LGBTQ until I was 19, and I find myself actively gender questioning for the first time at 21. It's been bothering me for quite a while and I've kept ignoring it until now. Trans people go through so much just to exist, and I'm a little afraid I couldn't handle that.

I often don't feel like a girl. I just feel like a person. The constant gendering seems unnecessary; it's tiring to constantly put off the vibe that people expect from cis women. It feels like a chore. I find myself wishing I would find out I was intersex so that I could have a physical reason to be a wide mix of feminine and masculine. 

She/her pronouns don't bother me, but I feel like people are missing some of me when they call me a girl. I'm comfortable in my body and don't feel a need to change it. I don't ever feel like a boy, but I do sometimes feel more comfortable if people look at me as a mainly masculine person. This changes day to day. I like to dress in a femme way sometimes, but it irritates me when cis men look at me like I'm a cis woman. I'm unsure if this is because I'm gynesexual and they're barking up the wrong tree, or if irritation is rooted in misgendering.

I'm terrified of what my family would say if it turns out I actually am genderfluid. They don't believe in more than the binary. It may not be worth the trouble of fighting them, but I want to live authentically as myself (whoever that is).

I find myself wishing I would find out I was intersex so that I could have a physical reason to be a wide mix of feminine and masculine. \n\nShe/her pronouns don't bother me, but I feel like people are missing some of me when they call me a girl. I'm comfortable in my body and don't feel a need to change it. I don't ever feel like a boy, but I do sometimes feel more comfortable if people look at me as a mainly masculine person. This changes day to day. I like to dress in a femme way sometimes, but it irritates me when cis men look at me like I'm a cis woman. I'm unsure if this is because I'm gynesexual and they're barking up the wrong tree, or if irritation is rooted in misgendering.\n\nI'm terrified of what my family would say if it turns out I actually am genderfluid. They don't believe in more than the binary. It may not be worth the trouble of fighting them, but I want to live authentically as myself (whoever that is). \n\nDoes this sound similar to anyone else's experiences?

I think I'm fluid because I think sometimes I want to be male, female, or something else entirely, and being fluid really fit that identity very well and makes me comfortable.

The problem arises when I try to figure out what gender I am at a certain time. When I have a gender in mind that I feel like being, there's no problem: I'm free to be myself. It's just that sometimes... I have no idea and nothing springs to mind.

I might be agender during these times because I don't have anything in mind, but a lot of times that doesn't seem right either.

The process of questioning and ""what am I?"" is really annoying, especially because I can't seem to find a gender identity that I really resonate with.

I wish I could just be a gender that I feel like when that's the case, and when I don't have any idea, just move on with my day without a gender. But not knowing your gender sucks.

105,2019-03-17 22:45:18,b2b2p7,5,33,"Hi!

I‚Äôm 23/AFAB non-binary. 8i really, really would appreciate if at least ONE awesome person took the time to read this and respond.

And yet I don‚Äôt even understand what non-binary really IS. I know I feel it to an extent, as I feel dysphoria to an extent, but I‚Äôm at odds. And I‚Äôll explain. Everything I italicize is going to include a question. 

Basic life story: was an extreme tomboy until I hit puberty. I mean, I really preferred to play with boys and boy things. *Dinosaurs and flinging mud were my shit, while dolls and dress up weren‚Äôt... at all.* but that doesn‚Äôt mean anything necessarily, or does it?

I was a very VERY awkward kid. My teachers wanted me screened for autism (which I believe I probably have but have never actually been screened so I can‚Äôt say I have it for certain). I remember going to the mall with my ONE female friend when I was 12. I picked out a giant baggy men‚Äôs band t shirt (I was probably a child‚Äôs large at the time, and I was picking out a mans large. I barely would grow more, maybe 20 lbs heavier, but I didn‚Äôt know that). She looked at me funny and told me to get one the right size and gender, and that‚Äôs when I knew I was sorta different ‚Äúthan other girls‚Äù. 

By 13 I was wearing makeup, not because I wanted to really but because it made me look older and get more serious attention I think. I remember hating waking up and putting it on in the morning but I felt like I needed to. I also subscribed to the ‚Äúemo style‚Äù by this point. So dumb, but at the time, very depressed 13 yo me (who had like, nothing to be depressed about anyway) felt a rare sense of belonging.

By 14 I ‚Äúlooked‚Äù fully feminine. As a child I was pretty damn androgynous (short hair, baggy clothes, same clothes every day although that may relate to the autism stuff) but then I was wearing makeup and grew my hair longer and learned some more basic girl skills and hygiene skills (as a 12 yo I‚Äôd go A LONG TIME w/o showering or changing clothes).

This is a weird thing but by age *15 I could finally touch my own genitals and breasts*. And no, I was *NEVER molested as a child. I‚Äôve spoken with my parents about this. I know for a fact if they knew I‚Äôd been molested they would have first off, told me, and secondly, killed that person.* But there comes the question. By age 15, I had probably had some semblance of a sex drive for half my life. Why couldn‚Äôt I touch my own vagina...ever? I had thoughts that somehow I was wrong and broken down there. 

I had fantasies of having a penis by this time also, and having sex with girls instead of boys. My first sexual experiences were with girls. We didn‚Äôt know what we were doing, really, but I know I enjoyed them immensely: thereby, making me at least bisexual because I like guys also.

Thing is, I‚Äôm 23 now, have fully accepted my sexuality and to a lesser extent my non-binary gender; but I feel almost robbed of it because it was never mentioned to me as a child. I struggled feeling differently for years, maybe partially because autism, but also from other women/girls. It was like bisexuality and gender didn‚Äôt exist to anyone around me. You were gay or straight. You are boy or girl. And trans people  exist, but they‚Äôre incredibly incredibly rare and you‚Äôll maybe see one every few years (NOT THE CASE!!!!!). And maybe this is because my parents are really, 100% part of the binary. They‚Äôre great, really. But my mom never questioned her womanhood. She loved being pregnant (I would feel so awful and dysphoric being pregnant). She‚Äôs 100% straight, or so she‚Äôs always insisted (how?! I really don‚Äôt even see how this is POSSIBLE lmao!, I mean, when I was 11 my female friends and I were showing off and touching each others‚Äô boobs and kissing, and while they may say it was a phase for them, it wasn‚Äôt for me!)

Anyways, 

Tl;dr: I consider myself completely non-binary but feel like a joke because from puberty onward I dressed up and wore makeup. Now people consider my hair (short, shaved) and my male dress as some sort of fashion statement, which makes me roll my eyes into the back of my head.

I‚Äôm terrified of being seen as a joke. I wish there was some way of ‚Äúproving to myself and others‚Äù that I‚Äôm enby, but I know you really can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to.

Sometimes I can get this overwhelming surge to transition and I believe I have to, and then it can fade and I‚Äôm like hmm I don‚Äôt mind being a guy for now, and I have this feeling full transition would end in regret.

137,2019-03-24 23:55:44,b53fbm,7,10,"For me, a big one is relationships. Being bisexual, how I act, dress, and think changes very drastically depending on who I am with. Generally speaking, when with females I tend to be in dom ""guy mode"" most of the time, while with males I'm in sub ""girl mode"".

I'd say social situations in general are what brings me to be one way or another. I haven't come out to my family, so I still dress as my assigned sex around them, which makes me very uncomfortable when I'm in the opposing mode, but hey, it's like that sometimes.

138,2019-03-25 00:30:02,b53sgr,2,3,"And I just wanted to share a little of my story because I don't think I can come out anywhere else right now, and maybe it will help someone who is struggling like I was just like so many post have helped me. I'm sorry if its long and a little rambly but I've had an emotionally intense day.

I was raised southern bapitst in Alabama in a very conservative area. I'm sure you are all aware of how Christian conservatives feel about the lgbtq community. As a Christian I was never against equal rights for all regardless of sexuality or gender, I convinced myself and my Christian friends that it was an issue between homosexuals, transgender, and god but not me. I told them I felt that we were supposed to love all as Jesus did even if they were sinners but in my heart I felt god was wrong to condem people for loving one another regardless of gender. Maybe it should have been a hint about my own gender issues, but I think I had internalized the feelings of diffrent genders and sexualities being wrong despite how I really felt. 

I'm 28 now and I finally have a label for how I feel, I'm bigenderflux between male and female, which means I feel as if I am one or both genders with diffrent intensities at times. I feel like I'm a little late to the party to be coming out to myself at this age but even though I deconverted a few years ago I've still been in denial with those internalized feelings of being wrong. I don't think I could have told you I had those feelings before the last couple weeks but even though I suspected I was not the straight cis man I was presenting, I was always reluctant to learn more about the lgbtq community in general and confront those feelings. I finally had to ask myself why I was so afraid of learning more about lgbtq? Why couldn't I admit to myself sometimes I felt female and wanted to be female? Once I confronted and realized those feelings from my past, that those archaic Christian values, were what was limiting me I finally could step past them. I've been learning about being trans, I've been lurking on various trans subreddits for the last couple weeks as well as doing google searches for more info or to define terms I didn't know before. I had a good laugh at myself over at r/egg_irl, more than half of my custom characters are female, and really enjoyed the supportive community of this sub as well as others. 

I stumbled on genderflux last night and it's resonated with me. I know labels shouldn't be important but having one helps me feel like I understand myself better, like there are other people who understand that I'm not alone, and that I can finally let go to the last of those internalized feelings of being wrong for feeling feminine. I said it ""I am genderflux"" aloud to myself but the title is my first confession to anyone else and it feels good to finally share a little. 

I've decided today that even though my given name is gender neutral (lucky draw), for now at least I want a separate one that exclusively feminine for when I feel mostly female. I feel that part of me deserves some special recognition after being denied for so long. I've already made this account and to be my closet trans account and given it a cute username. And I've been trying out Rachel in my head as a real name for when I'm female. I like that it and my given name both start with R but are otherwise completely diffrent and also think 'Ray' is a cute gender neutral nickname. However, I found out it is a Hewbrew name that means female sheep, and while I have nothing personal against sheep I don't like the idea of representing myself as one. Maybe I am overthinking it but I also considered Tally which is a little less common and a name I've enjoyed giving to my game avatars.

I don't know how I want to present myself yet, come out of the closet irl, if I might want to transition, or try hrt. That is ok though, I can take it slow and learn and explore these feelings on my own time. What's most important is that today for the first time I can say I feel feminine, I feel like she more than he and thats ok with me to do.

155,2019-03-26 15:53:58,b5rea8,31,7,"Disclaimer: I am new to research. I am not a scientific student. I am just a trans woman who has been on hormones for a little over 3 years. 

---

Here are all my questions:

* do you have body dysphoria 
* do you label your identity as transgender 
* do you experience sexual disfunction and dysphoria 
* are you on hormones 
* do you do body modification 

I have been trying to tease apart different structural diagnostic criteria and tease apart the nuanced differences between ""trans"" archetypes of individuals. For example, the word transsexual is explicitly used for folks who are taking medications and often getting surgery to fix a deep and profound loathing of their body as it existed since birth and especially after puberty.  However, a cross dresser, who is biologically the same from birth, does not take interest in such things. Therefore these complexes are not the same thing, and aren't treated as the same thing. 

I am researching into which (for lack of better term) factions of identity that are falling under the transgender movement flag are also experiencing problems with their sex lives and bodies, as well as just their assigned and expected behaviors. Those three things seem paradigm for transsexual, but not so with other 'labels'. 

Gender fluid to me as I perceive it is more similar to a goth clothing style, than to someone who would want surgery. The perception of one's ego and identity as it is expressed in their subjective culture might shift the way someone who cross dresses does. Their ability to self define and step out of the usual (as a goth might) seems the focus of the expressed behavior as it manifests VISIBLY. My curiousity extends deeper than what is visible, as not everyone who expressed fluidity dresses up differently at all. Therefore, it cannot be the same category as a cross dresser, or clothing and life style such as a goth. It must be different.

Again, to be clear, This is not to label gender fluid as cross dressing or a fashion statement. I don't believe it is, nor am I trying to prove that. In fact it's the opposite, I'm trying to find the neurological origin of these things but first I need to know which individuals to research further into and in what capacity. Is this an intersex condition? If so, to what extent? Does the complex exist outside of the western conception of gender as it has evolved to become? 

As I understand it, the discomfort with the stereo typical roles in society is where the exestential discomfort is expressed most profoundly. Often this is treated by neutralizing self perceived identity,  or society demanded roles by politely asking friends and family to use different pronouns, and perhaps dressing and using body form modification at times to blend in better with either a neutral or altered archetype the way a transsexual might also do, but often with no proclivity towards HRT or surgery. That is to say, you can have a gothic mindset without dressing goth. I don't believe goth is a neurological complex. I am trying to tease out where biology is playing and where social conditioning is playing.

I'm engaged to be married to a wonderful girl this October. I'm very attracted to her and other females in general.

But I'm also attracted to men (I've been with some and some trans girls - girls with cocks). 

I have gay friends, that act ""normally"" (like cis males but date other man) but it's my desire to be girly, paint my nails, shave all my body, behave like a female, but I think my coworkers (and specially my family and fiance) wouldn't be able to deal with it. 

What am I? What should I do? I'm the kind of guy who would wear my fiance panties and clothes if she goes on a travel. Since I live in a smallish town in afraid to go to gay bars and stuff and be discovered. 

What can I do? Should I just keep the secret since I could get in a bad position with my bosses and lose the woman I love or should I talk to her and make it clear that I also want to be feminine? 

One of my closest friends is gay, and he says I'm gayer than him, all I'm missing is love for cock (he knows I had some gay experiences with a mutual friend). 

If I had a magic lamp I'd wish to be born a pretty girl and I'd probably would want to date boys and girls, but as a 33 old male I don't know what to do. 

Sorry for the long post and bad grammar, but English is not my first language and I'm kind of drunk.

Thanks anyway.
