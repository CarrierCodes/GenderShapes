So, I'm 16, AFAB + nonbinary. I'm currently closeted, so often times, shopping sucks. My parents (who I can't come out to, due to them being cranky transphobes + homophobes) often immediately, of course, try shoving me into the most feminine looking article of clothing in the immediate vicinity. 

They already know I hate wearing dresses skirts (I've hated this since childhood), so while that isn't a problem, they still want me to look ""feminine"". I often hear things like, ""Look at this blouse!"" or ""You need to wear clothes that actually fit you right!"".

For context, prior to my most recent shopping adventure, I'd primarily walk around in these 3x men's t-shirts, seeking comfort in the fact that I was a shapeless entity in them. Why worry about binding when your shirt is too bind for people to notice? Who knows what your ""real"" gender is if your shirt is down to your mid thigh? It was the perfect system.

But! My parents wanted me to actually wear other clothes, + not look ""like a bum"". Cue me being dragged to a thift store a city or two over in the midst of a blizzard.

Once there, it was immediately apparent that there weren't many ""girl's"" clothes that fit me. I am 5'6, + hovering around 180lbs. So overweight. I also don't have much hip vs waist definition, so I'm much more rectangular than hourglass shaped. Almost everything I was forced into was either borderline too small, or too short. 

My dad then seemed to have a eurika moment. I was then allowed to go prance around the men's aisle for several minutes. I suddenly realized that I did, in fact, fit the lesbian stereotype of liking flannel. + button ups, in general! 

It turns out, men's shirts fit me a lot better! There's also less (I'm not sure the correct word here) ""narrowing"" in the waist portion of the shirts, which is nice! Most of them made me feel a lot more ""neutral"" than the rest of the clothes I tried on. + I was even allowed to buy them!!! 

This was a few weeks ago, but I thought I'd share. I've been wearing them since, + nobody's really commented on them (except for one person asking if I was wearing ""my dad's shirt""). My dad also got me men's jeans, which also seemed to fit me better. 

I am closeted, btw. So wearing more ""neutral"" clothes until I can do things like bind make me feel better!

Tysm for reading, + sorry if this is kinda disorganized! Have a great day / night!!! ^.^

So, let me preface this by saying that I do experience some dysphoria but most of it is easily manageable. I have disphoria about breasts, hips and my period. I wish I looked more androgynous, and fuck my period because I'm never bearing kids but the worst is my breasts, I don't bind, I tried, binding hurts and doesn't alievate my dysphoria anyway. They're fine, they're there, I wish they were way smaller but it's okay. I just don't want to take off my bra in front of anyone. I don't have bottom dysphoria.

I met a guy. He's gay, like... 4 or 5 on the Kingsey Scale. He's kinda NB too but I feel to a lesser degree than me. Less constant, should I say and most of his... gender play is sexual for him. He's probably more of a cross-dresser than NB I think. My point is, he's a bottom. And we're trying to fool around. It's kinda difficult. He likes when I act masculine and toppy. He has no urge to penetrate me, half the time I don't even really want him to because having something there feels unnatural (not bad, just... weird), and I don't have the means to penetrate him (yet).

Long story short, I bought a harness. And that's where my confusion lies. I never wanted to pack before. I think it's pointless, I don't want that squishy thing always in my pants, getting in the way. I'm fine with what I have, I like touching it, I don't want a dick 24/7, I don't want either top or bottom surgery, or hormones. But the idea of him feeling my erection (strap-on) through my pants and giving me a blowjob kinda turns me on (he is very much into that idea) and gives me euphoria? I think? Like, I really like the idea of having a dick for him that I can take off. I'd be fine with sex just being me fucking him. The idea of it seems so much more... natural. But I don't know if it's because I'm NB or because I'm admitedly kinda of an empathic person and whenever we're fooling around I can always feel he wants me to do it.

Basically, I don't know if it's a sexual thing, wanting to please him in a way I've fantasized about for a long time anyway. Like, women too can be into fucking their men... Plus, wanting a temporary dick, it's kinda a thing for some lesbians too, right? Walking around with it in their pants to be ready or feel powerful... Or if it's a NB gender thing. I'm pretty sure that if I had it on, I would be feeling myself up. I want to see it on myself, not just to please someone else, I wanna SEE it, you know.

Anyone relates? Any advice on how to differentiate the two?

53,2019-04-02 01:56:27,b8cw4j,7,14,"So this is going to be a long one. I'll put a TL;DR at the end.   


I'm 22, and just finally came out to my boyfriend as nonbinary. He is one of two people who know. But he is the first person I have told that it would directly affect.   


I have known that I wasn't just a girl since I was in my early teens. I learned what trans was and thought for sure that that was me. I don't know why, but I knew that it had to be me. I was probably 14 when I came out to my mom as trans. She lost it. She wouldn't allow it. She sobbed and sobbed, and made me feel so guilty. So I did what I always do. I tried to make it easier for everyone around me and just clammed it all up.   


I ended up having to do the same thing about being bisexual when I was 16, because someone in my christian choir group found out and told my youth pastor who told my mom. There was a family intervention, and I closeted myself again.   


Overtime I did realize that trans wasn't quite for me. I didn't really want to have a penis or lose my boobs. I just didn't feel like a girl all the time. I still kept it well squished down. In fact for the last 8 years I've avoided watching videos about it or looking at things. I did on occasion, but felt so much shame and pain that I decided to just avoid it.   


I have a beautiful boyfriend who is amazing to me. I can't believe I've found him. But I've kept this a secret from him too. I thought I could just keep doing this. Just keep pretending I'm just a girl and thats it. But I could feel myself becoming unhappy. I can feel this need to be free but I can't act on it. After all, what straight man would want an NB person for a partner? I really didn't think he'd get it. Especially by some of the things he's said in the past. (to be fair though, I fed into it trying to protect myself.)   


But it turns out, he is in fact not straight. I found out just a few days ago that he is bisexual. I was the second person to ever know. So i only felt it was fair that I told him my secret (he already knew i was bi). He was totally okay with it. He was actually so casual about it it struck me. It was the most anticlimactic thing, right next to paint drying (im not mad about it). I also realized it was the first time I really got to come out, and not be outted.   


  


So now that I know hes okay with it, and that I can do this.... I'm still terrified. I still have so much internal transphobia (I don't think thats the right term. I'm not trans). I've just fought myself about this for so long and now suddenly I don't have to anymore and I don't even know how to handle it.   


I have myself convinced I would be ugly as a boy, that i can't pass, and that people will hate me if i try. I was made to feel like something was wrong with me for so long I still feel like there is. Like I shouldn't be this way. I'm trying to break free. I want to break free. I just don't know how. 

&amp;#x200B;

does anyone have any advice or their own story to share? I don't know where to begin with myself. Feel like I'm trapped inside a body that isn't mine. I don't know how to fix it. I don't even know how i can express the masculine side of me.

I am AMAB, and I don't reject the idea that I am a man - I'm not interested in passing as a woman, looking like a woman, or being seen as a woman, but I LOVE women's clothes, shoes, makeup, etc. I go through waves of wanting to wear dresses all the time, wishing I could paint my nails, feeling all in all pretty feminine - which is great, I actually really enjoying feeling girly, but I don't have a desire to physically transition or, like I said, pass as female. What gets complicated is that in my interest in women's clothes, I also find myself often wanting to wear bras, or put on some nice lingerie for a fun evening. Therein lies my problem - I don't need to pass as female, so I don't shave my beard (or chest or back for that matter), and to be out and about in a cute dress with a beard and boobs kind of defeats my purpose/identity as a guy who happens to enjoy wearing dresses.

I'm not sure how to fit the two together. There's just something about wearing a cute bra under my clothes that excites me (not sexually) and makes me feel more feminine than ever, but I feel like that's going ""too far"" if you will, since I don't have a desire to be seen as a woman.
I hope this makes sense and I don't sound like a lunatic, but this is such a wild journey of self-exploration and acceptance and this seems to be one of the hardest stumbling blocks I've faced.

Any of you lovely people experienced something similar? Any advice for getting past this?

130,2019-04-04 06:51:01,b99dwo,5,11,"the pain of not knowing is so awful.  sometimes i feel really certain about transitioning to female, getting SRS, voice surgery, electrolysis.   then another part of me is afraid to let it all go.  like im betraying my desire to be female by saying that i sorta like having facial hair, sometimes.  but that same facial hair that i think looks good, i also get really dysphoric from.  im not sure if im attracted to it, or if i actually like how it looks on ME myself.   same with my adams apple.   then there's the feeling that its 'too late' to transition to female, since ill always have masculinized/testosteronized bone structure and voice.   obviously HRT and even voice surgery cant reverse that. and voice surgery is risky anyway.  and voice training, well, thats a whole nother mess for me.    

&amp;#x200B;

so sometimes i feel like trying to embrace my masculinity, ""own it"", seems like the right thing to do.  but then i feel like im denying myself true happiness.   so then that makes me think im definitely MtF.   but then again, when it comes to things such as genitals, its another mess.   apart from gender, i want to have a vagina.  but then, im sure ill miss what i have now.   and since my vagina wont be anatomically perfect, wont be anatomically the same as a cis one, well, that depresses me.  i have functional parts now, and i can get pleasure from them--so why should i change--the dysphoria is there, but still.  i feel like ill miss certain aspects of the parts once theyre gone.    thus, i dont think ill ever be 100% content.  it feels like a judgement of what will i like more, what i have now or what ill have after.   im always longing to have different parts, but once i have them, will i miss what i had before, grass is greener type of thing.   

&amp;#x200B;

i did try HRT for awhile, 2 years, but it didnt really make things better like i hoped. altho it didnt help that i was struggling with other things, so much so that i got myself gatekept because i sounded so unsure of HRT that my doctor didnt think it was right to let me continue using it.  im just so torn.  

&amp;#x200B;

i still struggle with internalized binary shit like feeling nasty doing 'feminine' things while hearing my low voice or seeing my reflection (that feels male).  for example, a person like conchita wurst. she's amazing, but i have an internalized reaction of aversion.  people might argue that that's some innate thing to be averse, or that its socialized, i dont really know. i see it both ways, but its kinda irrelevant at the moment i guess.   stuff like that is a struggle. its easy to wonder if i only want to transition so that ill feel socially 'allowed' to be feminine without judgement.   but i dont think its that simple, its just an irrational doubt that makes me think its that simple.  

&amp;#x200B;

i make up my mind, and then i unmake it up.  i could be so sure of myself that i could schedule an appointment for surgery, only to doubt it all the next day.   its easy for someone to say ""then youre not sure of yourself"", but thats not the case. its just how volatile i am that i can be so sure, and then remember something that i thought id gotten past, only to start being unsure again.   doesnt help that transphobic social things that i read while closeted years ago keep cropping up even in mainstream culture, like 'fear of regret', which i know isnt common, but its also why i haven't made progress, because i dont want to regret.  but i dont think ill ever be certain enough.    


long story short i dont feel content with my body and my social place, and i dont think i ever will.   sometimes i think i want it all, the privileges of men and the priviliges of women.  sometimes i think the only reason i want to keep my masculinity is because i know it attracts hetero women, and i view ""normal"" as hetero still.  biological essentialism and shit, its tough for me to argue against that because of something my biology teacher said, that the ""goal"" of life is to pass on our DNA.  even tho ""deviant"" sexuality occurs in other animals besides humans, its still considered deviant.  its considered a departure, a side route, off the straight and narrow path.  i mean the word straight itself, thats what i think of.  and yeah, i could take a trans-humanist view too, that its just biological programming and all that, and we could rise above our nature itself, but i also feel i kinda cant, since i just AM this living being, and its a mess trying to say ""well i think humans should use science to steer their 'evolution' this way or  that way, like how could i even make such a choice.  im addled by inaction.  i dont think im making much sense anymore.     


it just sucks.  my personality and identity is a fucking chameleon spazzing out.      


whatever i do, i feel like im enforcing constraints on myself.  when i try to be feminine, when i say, ok im definitely MtF, then i start imposing these restraints, where i excessively gender things. i need to act this way or that way, i tell myself, so that i will see myself as female, so that the world might see me as female.  yes tomboys exist, but i already am too masculine to be seen as a tomboy, if i try to do anything traditionally 'boyish' ill just be seen as a boy, not a tomboy.   i cant stop gendering things, my own behaviours, down to minutae, the way i sit/talk/walk/body language.    i think, ok, femininity is what makes me most happy.   but then im like not allowing myself to do masculine things.   but if i were to say, ok, im nonbinary, then i sorta just feel nothing.  like part of me WANTS the binary in order to feel like im female. then i feel like im guilty of what some TERFs accuse MtF women of, of reinforcing the binary.  

&amp;#x200B;

so for example, at the moment i feel this is stupid, im definitely mtf and i dont know why im here. but if i delete this post, i know ill start feeling uncertain again.   i know i can be a woman regardless of what i do with medical transition, or dont do, but thats not really the issue.     


ok, i guess im here because i cant help but conflate gender with anatomy.   sex characteristics, primary and secondary sex characteristics.   if i keep my facial hair, i FEEL masculine.  thats just how i am.  but regardless, i just dont know whether i want to get rid of it or not.  shaving it isnt good enough, but when it grows out a bit, its not so bad.  but sometimes i wish it didnt exist at all.  i wish i never went through testosterone puberty.   its because the parts i have are caused by tesosterone, that feels male and masculine, i guess.   so MAYBE its just that i know ill never be cis female enough to be happy with myself.   i always wonder what my body would be like if i couldve stopped puberty, couldve chosen the female route.   and since i couldnt, i feel ill never be happy with myself.  but thats when im feeling sure of being mtf.  other times its like, well, i dont know, i like how i look as a man.  it doesnt feel right, but it looks good.  idk if that makes me not mtf or not i guess. i dont want to be a fraud posting here, but honestly i just dont fucking know  


its like, my ideal self would be Tonks from harry potter.  able to change appearance and anatomy based on the moment.  but that ideal doesnt exist in reality.  i cant sometimes have hair follicles and sometimes not have hair follicles, cuz as far as we know, the human brain cant induce those types of physiological changes, and science (at least public science, to sound paranoid and crazy), cant do that either.  i cant sometimes have a penis sometimes not.  the best i could do would be to get surgery to have both, but even that isnt ideal.     


so i guess i just dont know how to cope with this.  there's no perfect solution.  it doesnt help that i feel myself getting older every day, and aging depresses the hell out of me, but thats sorta something else.

153,2019-04-04 22:49:40,b9jjji,19,1,"I'm a non binary AMAB gen X aged person and I've been thinking about this for a while while reading the posts here.

I see a \*lot\* of obsession with pronouns here and it has always seemed misplaced to me so I spent the last 6 months thinking about why I feel that way about it.

I think a lot of it is well intentioned but can easily cross into misguided and harmful to the non binary person but also to all other non-binary people in the world:

&amp;#x200B;

I see two big issues:

1) We are not \*a\* pronoun, we are gloriously individual non-binary people and no pronoun another person uses can possibly have any effect on who we are inside as non-binary people.

My gender is non-binary and nothing anyone says will change that, I can confidently take that to my grave, no one can change that.  

I may not look externally the way I want to or someone may say something shitty to me but it doesn't change who I am.

Pronouns are what \*other\* people use to discuss us with yet more \*other\* people, we are not actually part of that process directly; we are only peripherally involved.

At the end of the day we are still who we are and yes it sucks when people mis-identify us, but it's not the end of the world.  If a 70 year old grandmother can't remember you prefer ""they"" it should not be attributed to malice, it's just human nature.  If someone deliberately won't use your pronoun then they may be a shitty person, but that in no way changes who you are on the inside.

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for pronouns; we can and should ask people to refer to us by whatever we want but we have to also accept that we have no right to control other people, how they think or act and if they choose to not call us by the pronoun we requested then we need to accept that adjust our relationships if necessary and just move on.

Thinking that other people harm us when they don't use our preferred pronoun is painting ourselves into a corner mentally and emotionally.  It makes us weak because it hands over the control of our emotional and mental health to other people who may not have our best interests at heart.

Our energy is best spent cultivating our own inner garden so to speak and learning about ourselves and being as authentic as we possibly can and true to our nature.

&amp;#x200B;

2) There is a lot of hatred in the world towards visibly non-binary people right now.  It seems we are right in the cross-hairs  of the current culture wars and a target and we need to consider that carefully in what we put out into the world, both for ourselves but also for all the non-binary people that come after us or are in places where they can't be themselves.

Believing falsely that we have the \*right\* to control what words other people use is not only ironic and deeply wrong but it also generates hatred towards non binary people.

We should be better than that, we shouldn't hold hatred in our heart or spread negativity but instead be positive and understanding wherever possible.

Never attribute to malice what can be attributed to stupidity or carelessness.  Hold that attitude in your mind when you are misgendered and you will feel better and react better to the situation.  Obviously there are exceptions when people are being actively shitty but that's an opportunity for you to learn why from them if appropriate in a non-judgemental manner and also to show that you are not affected internally by it in any way because it doesn't change who you are.

It's not for their benefit, it's for your own mental and emotional health and it makes the world a better place for us all.

Being positive and not focusing on the haters and providing an example of how we want to be treated is the way forward.

A bit about myself. I have been diagnosed with Autism, depression, schizophrenia, and social phobia disorder (social anxiety).

228,2019-04-07 06:02:00,badg17,5,15,"Hi everyone.

So long story short, I‚Äôve struggled with my gender identity my entire life. As a toddler and preschooler I used to call myself names that were associated with the other gender and dress in clothing for both male and female genders. Growing up I wondered I was trans, but I tried cross dressing in public and it didn‚Äôt feel right. I spoke very deeply with my SO about it all, and they suggested I dress ambiguously to see how that felt.

It felt so right. I have a very neutral face. Not one you‚Äôd confidently call male or female. I feel comfortable in female and male clothing, sometimes more comfortable in one than the other depending on the day, but most of the time I prefer being somewhere in the middle. I don‚Äôt mind my biological pronouns at all, I feel ok with them because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm used to, I also really like they/them because it feels like it ‚Äúfits‚Äù if that makes sense. I also have a name that is very rare in America, it‚Äôs common in a third world country and so where I live it‚Äôs neither male or female predominantly.

Does this sound like it fits the definition of non binary? Did anyone else wonder if they were trans before realizing they didn‚Äôt want to be either? Is it possible to be comfortable with my biological pronouns but also with ambiguous ones? I don‚Äôt know what validates any of this, you know? Any input anyone can offer would be fantastic and super helpful. It‚Äôs been a long and rough journey and some advice would help ease the confusion, I think.

They know I'm NB and are mainly supportive. 

However, i was in the garage getting a beer for me and my dad, and when i came out my mom had said something that I missed. So i asked, ""What did you say?"" She giggled and didn't respond. So i pressed, after a few minutes of insisting she tell me, she giggled again and said, ""i asked your dad, 'how's our GIRL doing?'"" So i responded with, ""oh just fine thanks!"" Smiled and nodded, and went back to me and my dads project.  But it did get to me a bit. 

It was just a harmless remark but it felt like one of those ""playful putdowns"" only our families know oh so well how to do to us.

I also typed this on a phone, late at night, so sorry about any grammar mistakes or lack of any sense whatsoever. OK, here we go! 

I was born as a male, and for the last 17 years, I have thought of myself as a cisgender guy. I am not remotely stereotypical (purple and blue are my favourite colours, I have no interest in sports, I love art and books, I think I would enjoy baking and knitting but have never had the time to get good at either, etc.) I think I am attracted to girls, but I haven't been in a romantic relationship and haven't been strongly attracted to anyone ever (of any sex). Recently, I have been thinking (I've been thinking for several months about this topic, and probably another month about how I want to phrase this and if I want to), and realized some things:

I don't think of myself as having a specific gender

I would not care if I suddenly had a female body. (note: I am perfectly happy with my body the way it is now, except for leg hair. I hate that and wish it didn't exist) 

I feel more like a male than female, but only slightly (I'm somewhere very close to the center of that spectrum)

Society definitely thinks of me as male


So with all these realizations, I have no clue of I am cisgender, or nonbinary, or something else. The internet's definitions are quite contradictory and confusing. Anyone here have a similar experience? Am I a incredibly confused NB person, or a confused cisgender person, or am I something else?

 I‚Äôm having an issue with how I view gender. I'm confused about what defines gender. For example: Things that fit my body and who I am just happen to mostly be things that our culture considers masculine, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a man. 

Wanting a flat chest doesn‚Äôt make me a man. And just because I like painting my nails or am fine with a vagina doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm a woman. That‚Äôs just an activity and sex characteristic that our culture happens to correlate with women. 

So, besides biologically, what does it mean for someone to be a specific gender? If a woman didn‚Äôt have any sex characteristics and items/activities weren‚Äôt gendered, how would she know she was a woman? If a man didn‚Äôt have any sex characteristics and item/activities weren‚Äôt gendered, how would he know he was a man? I‚Äôm agender so I have no idea what that feels like.

It was mostly because I kept going through the motions of ‚Äòis it just internalized misogyny‚Äô, ‚Äòwhat does it mean to be a man and does it really matter?‚Äô, ‚Äòam I just upholding stereotypes if I do this?‚Äô. After agonizing about it for years, i just figured it was better not to think about transitioning. I know it‚Äôs shitty of me to treat nb identity like this, but it felt like a safe way to ‚Äòstep away‚Äô from the situation.

But I broke up with my boyfriend a few weeks ago and now that I‚Äôm no longer scared of him leaving me if I were to transition, all these feelings are coming back in full (and trepidatious) force. I‚Äôve pushed these feelings down for so long, and I‚Äôm not used to them anymore. They really scare me. I have a lot of concerns and fears about transitioning because even now, I don‚Äôt know if I can consider myself fully male.

Some of these feel shallow like, will anyone date me if I transition?  Is it gonna be impossible for me to be transmasc, with a vagina, and to date girls/guys/x? Will I even be attractive? What if I‚Äôm too short to be hot as a guy?

And then there‚Äôs ones that really scare me. How do I tell my family? How do I navigate the world once I start passing (and have male privilege)? How would I tell potential partners about it?What if I regret it? What if I‚Äôm just faking it?

I still kind of like wearing what would be considered fem clothes sometimes, I like make up, the way I act can‚Äôt really be read as male or female, so... i know this is wrong, but I can‚Äôt help but feel like I‚Äôm wasting ‚Äòtransitioning‚Äô if I still align myself with some fem habits.

I don‚Äôt know, I feel like if I transition I‚Äôm gonna have to start everything over and I feel like I‚Äôve put so much effort into navigating the world as a fem presenting nb person. I don‚Äôt want to be known as /the trans person/ in a friend group.

Did any of you feel this way? How did it pan out? 

Also I‚Äôm sorry if I‚Äôm using any wrong terms and please lmk if I‚Äôve got some fucked mindset about some of these things bc I get too in my head sometimes

I'm sure many of you can relate: for me, trying to find/wear swimwear has always been a  long, treacherous journey through Willy Wonka's Dysphoria Factory.

This summer I really want to enjoy my time at the beach, so I was thinking of finding a binder to wear for swimming, and I know gc2b has said their binders are fine to wear swimming! Has anyone tried it or another brand? 

Basically my questions are, did it dry ok if you wore it after you got out of the water? Does it become see-through? Did it irritate your skin? Did you like it? or were you still dysphoric and I should give up hope and just wear a t-shirt? Lol. Let me know.

I am a 17 year old cis bi male. Currently dating a 17 year old non-binary AFAB person. I‚Äôve been with them for about 2 months now and it‚Äôs been absolutely amazing, there‚Äôs been challenges for both of us but it‚Äôs been a really great overall.

It was not until meeting the person I am with now that I became truly aware of the LGBT+ community, I already knew I had feelings for more than just women but was never really involved in the community nor even used the term bi to define myself. All my knowledge of terms and pronouns comes through them; throughout this piece I might use some incorrect terms or phrasing, I hope you look past them and focus on message of the words instead of the words themselves.

Throughout the 2 months I‚Äôve been hesitant to do ‚Äònormal‚Äô relationship stuff (intimate) that would typically occur in a cis relationship (all my experience even though very little comes from cis relationships), they are the first trans person I honestly have spoken to, or at least open trans. I was always fearful of making them uncomfortable or putting them in a shitty position through me being a cis male, and this also being their first relationship with a cis person made it hard for me to make a ‚Äòmove.‚Äô Even kissing them for the first time was something I had to give too much thought, I wanted to very badly but it was something that seemed to have so many extra layers it was overwhelming. 

I did take the leap though and I‚Äôm very glad for it; however it‚Äôs come to the stage where a new challenge has presented itself. For the sake of transparency I‚Äôll be blunt: Sex. 

We‚Äôve always openly talked to each other about things, and we‚Äôve agreed this is something we are ready for and want to do. 

That being said I am really fucking worried and have anxiety over the whole situation about some many things it unreal. I have never been the most confident person but anxiety is new to me. I am both overly happy and overly scared whenever I think about it. Me being a male with a penis, I know there‚Äôs a lot of negative light about my role in sex. ‚ÄòI go in, fuck and sex ends when I‚Äôm done,‚Äô I absolutely don‚Äôt want it to be this way, I want it to be fun for not just me but also them. I know they‚Äôve never been with a ‚Äòpenis‚Äô so I also feel like it‚Äôs even more pressure on me especially since I honestly don‚Äôt have most experience using it. 

So I guess my real question is to all people who might have been in the position I am; a cis person dating a non-binary person and how sex worked for them. I don‚Äôt want to misgender the person I am with and perform the wrong gender role. We talked about it briefly and came to the conclusion that we would try and incorporate both gender roles. 

Some other factors I need to consider include - 

They wear a binder pretty regularly, does this mean I can‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt play / touch their boobs? 

They want to get sex organ reconstruction, should I not touch / use the one they have now? 

They have mild dysphoria about their hips, should I just not at all go near them or just try to not touch them. 

Obviously none of these things are an issue for me, it‚Äôs just I want them to feel safe and comfortable.  

I realise that these are all questions I should ask them, however I don‚Äôt get many answers from them. The only thing I get is ‚ÄòI‚Äôm pretty much open to anything,‚Äô which doesn‚Äôt feel right. It feels like an answer you give to dodge your actual feelings on the subject. 

In the end I am not sure why I am here, I guess some part of me wants advice, and another part just wants to cope. I hope that if any of you were in a similar situation as being either the non-binary or cis person in the relationship, you share your experience(s).",NonBinary,Dating non-binary as a cis teenager,1555142378.0,"{'created_utc': 1555117178, 'id': 'bcl6jb', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'I am not sure why I‚Äôm here; I am lost in the world of non-binary. Writing has always helped me cope, some of the information here might be irrelevant and not seem to have any clear purpose but I am trying not to overthink.\n\nI am a 17 year old cis bi male. Currently dating a 17 year old non-binary AFAB person. I‚Äôve been with them for about 2 months now and it‚Äôs been absolutely amazing, there‚Äôs been challenges for both of us but it‚Äôs been a really great overall.\n\nIt was not until meeting the person I am with now that I became truly aware of the LGBT+ community, I already knew I had feelings for more than just women but was never really involved in the community nor even used the term bi to define myself. All my knowledge of terms and pronouns comes through them; throughout this piece I might use some incorrect terms or phrasing, I hope you look past them and focus on message of the words instead of the words themselves.\n\nThroughout the 2 months I‚Äôve been hesitant to do ‚Äònormal‚Äô relationship stuff (intimate) that would typically occur in a cis relationship (all my experience even though very little comes from cis relationships), they are the first trans person I honestly have spoken to, or at least open trans. I was always fearful of making them uncomfortable or putting them in a shitty position through me being a cis male, and this also being their first relationship with a cis person made it hard for me to make a ‚Äòmove.‚Äô Even kissing them for the first time was something I had to give too much thought, I wanted to very badly but it was something that seemed to have so many extra layers it was overwhelming. \n\nI did take the leap though and I‚Äôm very glad for it; however it‚Äôs come to the stage where a new challenge has presented itself. For the sake of transparency I‚Äôll be blunt: Sex. \n\nWe‚Äôve always openly talked to each other about things, and we‚Äôve agreed this is something we are ready for and want to do. \n\nThat being said I am really fucking worried and have anxiety over the whole situation about some many things it unreal.

It's great that event organizers are making specific efforts to include trans women, because they've historically been left out of some queer movements and culture. But, like, as a non-binary person, it puts me in a really weird, uncomfortable position, to the point that I'm leaning toward not attending.

My SO has always experienced gender dysphoria their entire life. They were born female, however they recently began identifying as non-binary (Demi-boy). 

Identifying as non-binary is really causing them to struggle, because they have no idea how to start transitioning. Their birth name is very feminine and wants to change their name but has no idea when, or how, and is terrified to bits.

Besides that, they are very insecure about being female, and I‚Äôve been trying to help them transition smoothly but it‚Äôs very difficult and I just want a bit of advice? 

It‚Äôs also very hard for me not to refer to them as her or she. We‚Äôve been together for 5 years, they are my other half, but I genuinely like femininity and we both have no clue how we are going to begin a transition.

so... i've been identifying as a nonbinary person for about a year now, but until this day i'd only told my SO and a couple of very close friends.

i'm slowly coming out at work and today posted a meme from [/r/egg\_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/egg_irl), which has been seen by my superior and led her to ask me if i wanted to be called by different pronouns. i said i don't really care people using female pronouns at times, what bothers me is that those are *the only* pronouns being used.

she then said she'd call me anything that made me comfortable and i thought about using pins, *buuuut*...

i'm still figuring out where i truly lay gender-wise, not sure if i'm genderflux cause my presentation varies from andro to high femme to soft masc (if there's such a thing ?), yet **i know** i'm not cis, and presenting neutral/masc while getting only female reading/passing responses has been a huge bummer for the longest time.

so idk if i want a pin for each type of pronoun, one for all of them or just an ""ask me"" :|

i'm also kinda nervous about truly coming out because i'm not sure i can explain how i feel/who i am to people

I‚Äôve always come off as a quiet and maybe (to some people) intimidating guy, so I feel like now that I‚Äôm feeling less personally restricted and decided that I am going to just present how I want to and what makes me feel good when I look down at my body / in the mirror.

I mean, I‚Äôve gotten to the point where I want to explore sides of myself I never had previously felt comfortable with. 

Last weekend I had two days off in a row, so I did my nails. Then before I had to go back to work I cleaned them off. All day at work I just got kinda sad and very annoyed with myself that I had folded so quickly. And it turns out my eye makeup was still kinda visible and I immediately got called out by one of the people I didn‚Äôt want to see me in a more feminine role, but it turned out he was surprisingly cool about it‚Äîto my face at least. But I did also just have someone laugh right in my face when he asked if I had worn eyeliner. That didn‚Äôt feel great. I didn‚Äôt say anything except that, yes i had been wearing it. 

But mostly I‚Äôve just been like whatever I‚Äôm gonna wear my nails this way and maybe keep the other makeup for when I‚Äôm off.

I know i wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable if I were were to actually have my face done up, and wearing stockings instead of long johns under my ripped jeans, or whatever at work.

562,2019-04-16 19:10:53,bdxvh2,17,10,"Hi guys, looking for advice regarding boobs-related dysphoria and top surgery.

I'm a masculine-leaning fluid enby. My aesthetics is basically 'cute androgynous femboy'. I feel masculine-leaning about 95% of the time and feminine-leaning the remaining 5%. I'm only dysphoric about two things : my voice (doing voice-training for that) and my boobs. I wear a binder almost everyday and I can't make up my mind on whether I want top-surgery or not.

The problem is that 5% of the time when I'm feeling feminine. More precisely, I like having a flat chest when I'm clothed. I like looking like a cute boy or simply a man. But when I'm naked... I like my feminine silhouette. I have pretty nice boobs actually. I always get plenty of compliments on my nude pics.

If I had the power to switch boobs on and off whenever I want I would leave them off most of the time. So it would make sense to remove them... but at the same time, do I want to do a surgery I would regret 5% of the time ?

I could just keep on using a binder. But sometimes I can't wear it for a couple days because it starts hurting and those moments suck. There's also sports where I can't wear it and it sucks. Swimsuits are okay, feels like lingerie/being naked for me. I feel like I would just feel so much more comfortable and sure of myself if I didn't constantly have to worry about whether the shape of my chest is showing through my clothes.

As I grew up I realised that gender in general didn't matter to me in the slightest.

I discovered as well that I was pan, because if gender doesn't matter to me, then why should it for the person I love?

My question now is, I am grown up and I feel extremely uneasy in my body.

I feel like I am not myself in the body that I am in and I was wondering if you guys have some advice in gender exploration? Or not even gender but how you guys feel better about yourselves?

662,2019-04-19 15:38:03,bf0iys,5,8,"Hi, I'm been participating in the various transgender communities for a while. A really good community. I've seen a lot of postings regarding ""am i trans"".. This is a slightly different posting.. as in.. trying to figure out what my body is trying to tell me re non-binary vs mtf. 

It is not clear to me that I am MTF.  I don't have a desire for GRS. However, i do feel a strong desire to at least start on HRT, but this is not possible where I live.. Well maybe i can get the estrogen, but the anti-androgens and medical support is a different issue, and not driven enough yet to consider administration without expert assistance.. Also, it may be very difficult with border control if my face no longer matches my photos, and the little i know is that change in gender markers do not go down well here \[ nearly impossible to change any local government paperwork \]. 

For three years i  wear skirts/kilts every single day religiously. In the last few months i'm wrangling with home laser hair removal (tria) full body.. I seem happy enough to undergo intense pain for beard hair removal, so something is obviously driving me to do this without regret or reservation. \[ The professional hair laser removal salons are .. well.. not trained on Male beard hair removal in this region, so wrangling with doing it safely myself \] .

So given the above, i'm doing the simple things that i can... wear increasingly fem / tom-boy clothing, and remove hair.. At what point do you discover if this is enough, or that you need to push through to hormones...  Stated another way, my body is demanding every day to feminize, towards some tom-boy look (which is impossible for my body to look fem while dressing masc without hormones).  Did people in the non-binary community find that their body was ""demanding extremes"" but kinda mellowed out when you got half way?  Or did you find it was more ""no, the changes i needed to do always felt more middle of the road / androgynos / other, demanding as hell, but it did not feel like a push towards full femm?"".  I also know that some people are gender fluid, which may be at play to some extent, but the demand for HRT from my body is not fluctuating. 

My complication is that different aspects of my body have independent opinions. Mind says non-binary / tom-boy, my emotional frame is a balance of male and femm, my social side says i do not want to be associated in the mainstream male group,  and my body is screaming fem as hard as possible.  I know it is possible to be trans femm non-binary .... i guess i'm wondering, if that body level drive is going to calm down as i femm more, or if it is going to scream at me for HRT every day till i comply. or do i have just to wait, do what i can, be patient, and ride the wave as it unfolds in whatever way it is going to.

I always have had low self esteem and didn\'t feel confident in the way my body looked but I had no desire to work out, bulk up and grow more masculine.  I was chubby as a kid and I always thought I would be confident in my own body when the fat was gone, but even after I lost most of it, I still didn\'t see what I wanted in the mirror.  Even after losing weight I always hated my \'thicc\' thighs in spite of receiving many compliments on them, and they didn\'t empirically look bad but because inside I always had this desire for a petite, feminine frame.   I realize now that I\'d been having feelings of dysphoria my whole life but I never knew what it was!  Anyway, I\'m really glad that I know myself better, and that I now know what I desire to correctly express my gender identity.  And I\'m also really glad to be a new part of the nonbinary community! :)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""I feel like I've been heading here for a while without knowing"", 'created': 1555824539.0}"

One of my friends came out as agender recently and really likes fey/feym pronouns.  I have no experience with the words, so I figured I should ask.

Is there a general consensus on how to use fey/feym? Is it treated like they/them/their and has the possessive ""feyr/feir""? Or is it ""feys""?

Also, is ""feym"" pronounced ""fame"" or ""fem""?

Does any of it really matter, or is the use entirely up to the individual?

892,2019-04-25 02:47:06,bh3jmd,7,6,"So, 15-year-old miserable little AFAB here.

The past three years of my life have been a drag. Finding out that I'm bisexual was hard enough, but I've been totally fine with that for some two years or so now. Questioning my gender, however, has persisted and worsened significantly over the past two years.

I told myself it didn't matter. That I'm just a confused girl who will get over it. That's it's just a phase. That it's not real. That it's not worth even pursuing.

But I still feel very much like shit a lot of the time.

When I'm fine, I'm fine. Meh, girl stuff is close enough, whatever, whatever. When I'm _not_ fine, _damn_.

I just want to talk about the stuff I feel that may be dysphoria or may just be teen misery and hormones (hell if I know; I'm not a therapist).

Like my hips, I can sometimes be okay with, but generally I don't really like. My chest pretty regularly bothers me, sometimes just a bit but sometimes _obsessively_ (I bind pretty regularly with the camisole method). I dislike my voice about half of the time because I think it's too high and then the rest of the time I'm neutral. I pack sometimes because occasionally, I somewhat feel like I'm supposed to have different equipment than what I do (I've noticed on these masculine days where I do choose to pack, I feel more at ease with myself and more confident). But in the end, I'm sometimes okay with just being a girl, or sometimes a gnc girl. I wouldn't say I'm ever wholly satisfied with it ‚Äî typically just neutral, but neutral is _so_ much better than discomfort. 

I've generally felt like I fall somewhere under the NB umbrella. I constantly fluctuate between identifying as NB or just GNC, and sometimes fluctuate between whether or not I even think NB is real (I believe it is, but sometimes I tell myself it's not in the hopes that my mind will force the possibility out). 

I continuously police myself and think that there's no way, and I'm bullshitting myself, and I just want attention. So I hate myself for not being what I think I should be, and then I hate myself even more for not knowing what that even means.

Okay, bear with me because this is going to take a while.  I just felt like I was at a place where I am ready to share my full story about my discovery.

I am 33 years old, I recently started exploring my true self and realized that I am NB.  This was around early December.  I was born with male genitalia, but a lot of the time I feel like a girl, and thus enjoy dressing in Women‚Äôs clothing, including unmentionables.  Before, I always did in private and would wear it under my male clothes even keeping it from my wife.  I was scared and unsure about how the people around me would react.  The first week of December the wife and I were hanging out and having a conversation about something related to movies and I brought up a romcom that I enjoy and had been reminded of by a phrase.  My wife jokingly called me a girl, because I like Rom-Coms and pretty much any other Chick Flick.  (When I was younger, I waited until my parents went to bed and watched ‚ÄúThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants‚Äù on one of the movie channels.  My parents are pretty conservative and my dad would have been freaked out by my enjoyment of such a film.)

Anyway, back to the story, my wife said I was a girl because I like romcoms because she thinks most of them are sappy and lame.  I was feeling particularly girly at the time, and her saying that for some reason made me feel really good.  I know she did it in a picking way, but something about her tone made me feel more comfortable in that moment.  Also, I was stoned and feeling pretty good already, so I decided to inform her that I actually feel girly at times and sometimes wish I could be more feminine.  I even explained to her that sometimes I sneak into her closet and wear her bras and undies under my clothing, and at times I‚Äôve borrowed a top or two.  She was totally cool with it, had a few questions, but was totally cool with it.  Then a few days later, I told my mother in law and brother in law who live with us.  I am still not comfortable with telling my conservative parents, especially my father.


To continue the story, since we were just a few weeks from Christmas, my wife decided to surprise me by getting me a few pairs of girly underwear, some hipsters and a few thongs (I‚Äôm a grower not a shower, so as long as I‚Äôm not erect they fit pretty well) and she put them in my stocking.  She also told me that I can wear any of her clothes at anytime, except for one specific pair of leggings that is her favorite.  I have never felt more comfortable in my skin, I feel like I can be who I want to be.  I still wear Men‚Äôs clothes to work and when I‚Äôm feeling more masculine, it is about 70/30 right now, 70% of the time I feel like I can identify as a female, and when I do it is nice to be able to dress that way.  I have longer hair for a male and I usually pull it back into a ponytail, this way I can still feel a little girly even when I have to dress like a guy,

I know that a lot people outside of my home would judge or ridicule, so for now I only dress feminine on my days off, when I‚Äôm at home.  I did run out to the car with a top and leggings on the other day and it is the first time I‚Äôve left my house with a pair of leggings on.

Anyway, just wanted to share my story with you.

Long post warning! I want to apologize in advance if I say anything that offends anyone, that is not my goal. I am uneducated and I want to learn. TLDR just below

TLDR: A student just came out to me as NB, but isn‚Äôt open to everyone yet. I need advice to help support them, especially because they aren‚Äôt out.

I am a high school choir director (as you can probably tell by my name, I needed an excuse to make a ‚Äúwork‚Äù account, and this is the perfect reason) and yesterday a student came out to me as NB. I try to be supportive of ALL students in my class, and in the performing arts, I have quite a few LGBT+ students. Until now, I‚Äôve never had a student that is NB (at least to my knowledge). When this student told me, they were understandably nervous and in tears, as they have only told a handful of people and most were not supportive (including best friend and mom).

As I sat and heard them open up about who they truly are, I tried to be careful about when and how I spoke. I wanted them to be able to explain everything, as much or as little as they wanted. You see, I‚Äôve NEVER had to do something like this, so I can only imagine how difficult this is. I‚Äôm a straight male, I‚Äôve never had to justify myself to anyone. I only interrupted to stop self-deprecating comments, because‚Ä¶ well that one‚Äôs obvious. They spoke about how their mom doesn‚Äôt understand, and just wants them ‚Äúto be less of a tom-boy‚Äù. I know I can‚Äôt interrupt their dynamic, because I‚Äôm a teacher, so that part is very difficult for me to help with. Then a lot of things hit me all at once.

I have been part of the problem. Like most choir programs I have gendered choir names (Men‚Äôs choir/ Women‚Äôs Choir) and I have gendered choir uniforms (tuxedos and dresses). I currently have a Trans student, and they wear their preferred uniform and sing in the gendered choir of their preferred gender. I‚Äôm being supportive and inclusive, right? Well I thought so, until this smacked me in the face. I began asking a ton of questions (in retrospect may have been poor timing on my part) like ‚Äúdo you feel uncomfortable with the name of your choir? Do you feel uncomfortable with your uniform? Would you rather wear the other gendered uniform? Would you rather wear something completely different as your uniform? When I say ‚Äúladies‚Äù or ‚Äúgirls‚Äù in class do I make you feel uncomfortable?‚Äù I wanted to know what I could do to help, then the other thing came into play. **(Are these the right questions? What questions did I miss, or shouldn‚Äôt have asked?)**

They aren‚Äôt out to everyone yet. They have only told a few people, some of which haven‚Äôt been receptive to their identity. They don‚Äôt want me to make a bunch of changes, because they feel that it will bring a bunch of attention to them, and they‚Äôll have to deal with that. I want to be understanding of that. I don‚Äôt want them to open up until they are ready. This isn‚Äôt about me. I made it clear that if this helps them feel more comfortable I have no problem changing the names of the groups or the uniforms, and I‚Äôm willing to fight that battle against anyone else that disagrees with me because, well, this is my choir program and I can run it however I want! I am totally fine with them wearing a tuxedo in a choir full of dresses. They said that they don‚Äôt want to do any of that right now because they aren‚Äôt out, and it will only cause more problems with their mom (it sounds like mom doesn‚Äôt really understand any of this, and thinks its a phase. Dad isn‚Äôt really in their life, except for summers). I told them to think about all of these things and when they feel like they know what it is that they want to let me know. I don‚Äôt want to push that decision. The last thing I asked was ‚Äúwhat is your preferred pronoun?‚Äù To which they quickly responded ‚ÄúThey/Them‚Ä¶ Woah I can‚Äôt believe I just did that!‚Äù That was an awesome thing to be able to witness.

So here is my overarching question: what can I do to help a student that is NB without drawing too much attention to it, because they aren‚Äôt out yet? They are pretty new to this Non-Binary thing, so they are still figuring them self out. How can I help them on that journey?",NonBinary,Choir Teacher needs help supporting NB Student,1556317019.0,"{'created_utc': 1556291819, 'id': 'bhngra', 'num_comments': 25, 'score': 23, 'selftext': ' \n\nLong post warning!

I feel like I am not prepared to explain NB to people, and that they will just use my vague answers as a way to invalidate NB people. 


Anyways...


A visibly GNC person came in with their partner to our restaurant last night. They were treated respectfully etc... but when my boss returned from taking them to their table he began to talk about the GNC person. 


‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt understand... I guess I can understand trans people but...‚Äù 


He wasn‚Äôt disrespectful (he is a cis gay man) at first, and has a very rude sense of humor that is pretty dry. We are good friends and talk outside of work (maybe a 10 year age gap?). He never would have said this in ear shot of the customer but somehow after my vague deflections(  ‚ÄúI understand it‚Äôs a difficult concept for some people‚Äù ‚Äúas long as you are respectful to them, that‚Äôs what matters even if you don‚Äôt agree or understand‚Äù etc. ) he made a joke essentially calling them a freak. 


I was visibly uncomfortable, and I know he didn‚Äôt mean it in a hateful way but it was still sad to hear. He asked me to explain it to him because he didn‚Äôt understand...


So after 30 seconds of stuttering out loud and debating in my head what to do...


**I came out to him!**


I told him that I‚Äôm very closeted but I identify as NB, that she pronouns are fine with me since he has been using them, but other NB people may feel strongly about their pronouns and they should be respected. I told him that I have a really hard time explaining it to people, and I am afraid of judgement, which is a big reason as to why I don‚Äôt come out to people. 


His response was really positive! He asked me to explain it more to him sometime when I feel comfortable, and that he doesn‚Äôt disagree or want to invalidate NB people; he just doesn‚Äôt understand and doesn‚Äôt know where to start. 


SO IN CONCLUSION:

What are some easy, low reading, low stress links videos pictures, or anything really, that I can show him? 


I don‚Äôt want to overwhelm him with sources but I want to explain it in a way that summarizes being NB, and leaves the door open for him to learn more if he feels he needs to!!!

It's all donated clothes so I knew the chances were slim to none, but I haven't been able to buy a binder, nor have I been able to apply for those free/cheap binder programs.  
Why didn't I ever apply for those programs? Well, as it says on one website....

""**Please only make a request if you are truly in need of one.** ""  
I never felt like I was truly in need of one. Sure, I had some chest dysphoria, sure, I knew I was nonbinary, but there was going to be someone out there who needed it more, who had worse chest dysphoria than me, and it was wrong of me to try to take a binder from them. So, I didn't get one. I dealt with awkwardly fitting shirts and bad days and took it all on the chin. I figured, ""I wouldn't even wear it that much. It probably won't look the way I want. It probably would hurt.""  
And then, I went to the clothing swap, and found a black, XL, gc2b binder.

I couldn't believe how happy I was with how I looked in it. How euphoric I felt. How my shirts looked with it on. I'm wearing it right now, and it feels so so good. I've smiled every time I've seen myself in the mirror. Don't get me wrong, I still love my breasts. But being able to look the way I do right now has given me more euphoria than I knew I could have.

So, to the person who donated this binder: thank you so much. It is going to be very very loved.

And to anyone who was feeling like I was, like you don't deserve a binder, like you aren't ""trans enough,"" like you don't have enough dysphoria: you are trans enough, and you deserve everything that will make you happy. **You** are the person truly in need. I was lucky enough to get one, and if you feel like you want one, and can't afford one, you absolutely should apply for one if it is something you're interested in. If you can afford one but are hesitating, I recommend giving the gc2b ones a try.

To everyone reading this: you are enough.

I've been dealing with gender for a longgg time and is one of the parts of my identity that has been the hardest to understand for myself (especially in comparison to my sexuality, which didn't take me long to figure out I'm queer AF lol). Also, if this is posted in the wrong category then my apologies and I will delete/change it! 

I am FAB (born female at birth). As I've been thinking about my gender more, I knew I was at least non-binary/non-cis/genderqueer. I considered trans/trans non-binary, but when I delved deeper I realized I kind of want to ""reject"" gender altogether. I'm not sure if that makes me agender or something similar... but that's why I'm sharing to hopefully figure it out!

A big part of this is when I started to do more research on the pathologization/medicalization on queer bodies (esp queer people of color, like me). I have experienced this within my own health and sexual organ complications growing up. To confuse things even more, my body didn't develop as it ""should have"" during puberty as I had hormones that made me look more masc than feminine. I know that sex =/= to gender, of course. But I can't deny that a lot of those traumatic experiences have pushed me to not want any genitalia at all and dis-identify with all gender entirely. 

All of those experiences also contribute to my body dysphoria. I've been called m'aam, sir, boy, girl, etc and even though I don't snap at people or feel especially upset, I don't really feel comfortable with any of those words or pronouns. At the same time I feel more patient with this in other queer spaces vs. out in public because at least other queers are quick to correct themselves and very apologetic since we can all relate to the importance of being referred to properly. I currently have adopted they/them as my go-to pronoun. 

Still, it doesn't help that I'm curvy, have a full breasts, and a baby-face that ""give away"" that I'm FAB. Again, I know gender expression/performativity are not the same as gender, but in my case I feel it's an important part to mention within my experiences of gender exploration. It seems no matter what I wear, how I feel, makeup or no-makeup, I will always be perceived within the binary or even not being enby *enough* :( It also doesn't help that I'm taking classes on topics of different discourses on sexuality, gender, etc which only confuses me more :')

I‚Äôm on a wait list for hormones, pass very well as is, getting divorced (unrelated to transition, he‚Äôs bi, got a girl pregnant, it‚Äôs like, totally done), and have been casually dating a cishet man for 6 weeks now. We‚Äôve both come to the conclusion that we‚Äôd like more out of this than we ever thought we‚Äôd find on Grindr.

I am understandably apprehensive about this!! This guy and I have a ton in common, more than I ever did with my husband (I got married when I was 18, lesson learned) and we are both looking to take things slow, it just feels like it‚Äôs time for the next step.

He‚Äôs great in every conceivable way thus far. He treats me very well, respects my boundaries, we show each other new things both SFW and NSFW, we‚Äôve gone out every weekend since our first date. It‚Äôs gotten better each time. That said, we are both insecure as all hell. He has had some fucked up relationships and has been going to therapy to work through that and is making good progress, evidently. I‚Äôm still anxious as can be though.

Basically, I‚Äôm very very concerned that he‚Äôs going to miss cis girls and leave me? He has dated a couple trans girls since high school and by his account the one sort of serious relationship ended mainly because of distance. He has also got a way of phrasing things where, although his heart seems to be in the right place, it makes me feel insecure even though they‚Äôre compliments? He‚Äôs very attracted to me which is great but he‚Äôs like amazed at how smooth I am which is cute because he rubs my legs but I immediately cringe at the fact that I shave my entire Italian bear ass body two hours before he comes by. He says I look incredible despite being ‚Äúall natural‚Äù (meaning pre-HRT) and says it‚Äôll only get better for me re: dysphoria but also me becoming more attractive because hormones are magic, and my mind immediately goes to losing sexual function and therefore losing all of my niche fetishized appeal even though he has not actually said anything to make me think he‚Äôs fetishizing me!

I‚Äôm listing out all of the bad and I shouldn‚Äôt. We have endless things to talk about while he‚Äôs here, he calls me to say goodnight and we talk for hours more often than not, it seems like the beginning of something great. But when I was with my husband I constantly felt like he was looking for something I couldn‚Äôt readily provide (vaginal intercourse hello) and now, despite the fact that this new guy is very much interested in all of my body, I feel like eventually he‚Äôll get bored of me and knock up his coworker like my ex did.

I know it feels like it turns your world upside down and I know how much that scares you. You might feel at some point like you're forgetting who you really are. I want you to know that you're never losing who you really are. 

First off: these feelings have probably been there for a longer time than you think, except they were covered up by some good ol' repression or you didn't really notice them because your environment just accepted you being a tomboy, for instance. If you look back, you might discover that these feelings really didn't come out of the blue.

Secondly, as strange as it may sound transitioning won't drastically change you. Yes, your appearance might change, your wardrobe might, the way people see you will change. But the other things that make you *you* will not. Think about your taste in music. The shows you watch. The things you are passionate about. Those will probably not change. And what's more, your personality won't change. The delightful way you laugh at a dumb joke. The endearing way your eyes light up when you talk about something interesting. The lovely way you love those you hold dearly. Those will probably not change either.

And even if they do change, it's because that's who you (apparently) truly are. It's not like you're transitioning into a new person, you're transitioning into who you were inside all along. Transitioning into the person that you were meant to be all along.

Thats what i keep telling myseld anyway but recently, past week or so its like everyone has just given up and gone back to my original female name.

At first i corrected them and then they were good for the next few mintues but its gotten to the point where im tired of reminding people of my name constantly. Not to mention its extremely awkward sometimes.
I work in customer service and my name badge has my male name on it, not to mention i wear the male uniform. To the customers i am a male and they refer to me as such. This is where the awkward part comes into it.

My birth name is stupidly feminine, no getting around its a female name so when they tell a customer their order will come from me and they use the wrong name i am left with confused customers. A lot of the time i shrug it off and say she just went on break or something like that, its like my female name has become a mystery worker...

Ok this is longer then planned.
My point is its just awkward but brining it up all the time iv been getting two reactions.
One, they dont stop apologising and i just feel like a jackass for bringing it up, i had one coworker cry over it saying she was trying...
Or two, they are starting to get annoyed with me.

Im not sure what to do. It hasnt been long so i feel like going to management, who still mess up would be an bad idea but i also feel like if i dont do something ill just go back to being a girl which is killing me.

(I am a pansexual cis girl if that matters) I'm not 100% sure why this is but I have a few ideas. First, I've had better experiences with trans/nonbinary people being non judgemental towards my body type, most likely due to their own experiences with body acceptance. I also happened to have a crush on a trans girl at a very formative point in my journy of queerness and that might play a role. Those ideas sound ok to me. The third thing however is that I do think I'm more sexually attracted to penises, so when a girl happens to have one it works out in my favor. To me this doesn't feel like a fetishy thing because, even though it is about genitals, I would never discriminate one way or another based on genitals, I would never be embarrassed to date a trans girl publicly, and I don't see the person as only being their genitals. It just feels like any other physical and/or sexual preference to me (it's no be all end all).

I struggled a lot in order for my parents to accept me as I am but fortunately I have their support. I do not have a permanent job at the moment and I've been studying to take the entrance exam for one of the bests universities in the country, UFRS (I graduated in Philosophy at the beginning of the year, but I did not finish high school yet and that keeps me from participating), which leaves me without the time. In addition to not producing income, I still incur costs to my family because I have a psychologist and, in the future (hopefully) I'll have an endocrinologist.

So, I got a few tidbits of, uh, astonishingly bad news last night... So I was talking with another trans friend, and she was wondering what my levels were. So I told her, ultimately... My T was at 226 (hers at 10) and my E was 38, and hers was 121.

So big fucking ouch. I felt like my drugs were doing nothing for me. That is a BULLSHIT high number for T, and I wanted to cry and cry and cry. The only real difference, and she had started after me, is that she‚Äôs on injections. And I‚Äôm on pills. My dosing is currently Spiro 200mg/day (I take it at night, if that means anything) and my Estradiol is 10MG (2 tabs AM, 3 PM). 

Seems like something isn‚Äôt working. Not sure what to do...

I was also wondering if anyone could possibly lead me in the direction of an insurance company that covers HRT a bit more than, uh, not at all... My insurance will not touch any of my HRT... So I‚Äôm shelling out $75+ per 1 months supply :/ I currently live in Wisconsin and have WPS insurance through my work.

So, I finally started E and Spiro a few days ago, and it has been quite wonderful knowing things are changing! So woot for that! 

Anyways, while my Doctor was talking to myself about the side effects of Spiro, she mentioned my potassium intake. And how, and I quote, ""...shouldn't eat four or five banana's a day"". Now, I have no problem with that. But what concerns me is that fact that I have an incredibly high metabolism. Like three to four thousand calories a day. As far as I'm concerned, anywhere from 3500mg to 4700mg of Potassium should be consumed daily. The concern is that even with just the basic consumption of food, I'm getting very close to those 'limits'. Now, I'm by no means flipping out about this, and in retrospect I should've inquired further. However much I didn't realize how prevalent potassium is in food.

So with that, the title comes back into play. How much potassium should one consume? Anyone experience any side effects?

204,2019-04-06 05:56:57,ba1crb,9,8,"I am AFAB. I really feel as if I'm transgender (FtM). My problem is that my experience doesn't seem to fit the classic formula and I'm afraid I'm just kidding myself. 

When I was little I always wanted to watch Pokemon and superheroes and action movies. I wanted to play with hot wheels and play videogames. I preferred bugs and reptiles to horses and cats. 

But, I also watched Barbie and Bratz. I used to dress up and play princesses with my cousin, though I never dressed up as a princess outside of those occasions. I remember preferring the masculine things more, but it's not like I didn't enjoy the feminine things as well.

I didn't have a problem with puberty. In fact, I didn't care about my body image at all or what puberty entailed. It just didn't really register as anything special. I also had a period where I constantly wore makeup and girly clothes and would hardly be seen without them. In fact I still find makeup fun to do to this day.

But, my friends and I used to be super into roleplaying when we were younger and we'd have huge texting conversations dedicated to a roleplay. I can't ever remember playing a girl in those scenarios. I always play a boy when I can, whether it's the male version of myself or a character. Even now when I play D&amp;D I have much more fun when playing as a male. 

I stopped wearing girly stuff and started wearing baggy sweatshirts and pants to try and hide my body shape. I shaved off most of my hair and cut it down. I stopped wearing makeup for looks and have taken to only doing it for fun now or if I need to get dolled up for interviews and things. 

I've created this image of myself in my mind and it's a male now. I don't feel comfortable seeing myself as a girl and I dissociate with my body to keep from feeling dysphoric. That or avoid the mirror. I don't feel dysphoria often, but when I do it's so intense that I break down crying and choose not to go out in public, since I'm already feeling dysphoric and don't want to be misgendered as well.

When I think of my body I imagine having a man's body. It makes me incredibly uncomfortable to think of my genitals as female. In fact I can't remember the last time I used the proper feminine terms for my body, instead choosing to use male descriptors and finding them much more suitable. I used to be able to read ""x reader"" fics and enjoy them, but having the character that is supposed to be me referred to as female feels so wrong now that I can't read them anymore or I have to find the male versions, which are much harder to come by. 

In gym class or any class when they would sort boys and girls, I always hesitated and felt gravitated towards the boys side. I wanted to be on the boys side. I always felt like I was being shamed and forced into a role over something as simple as splitting up the class between boys and girls. When asked on forms what my gender is or what pronouns I prefer, I don't know what to say. I know that I want to say male, but for fear of being discriminated against, I write female.

I want to transition and would in a heartbeat, but I'm terrified that no matter how much surgery or treatment I get, I will never pass. I'm 5' even and my body is incredibly curvy. My face is far too soft to be masculine and my voice is a whole other story. If I could have been born a boy, I'm sure I would be much happier with myself and my body, but thinking of going through a full transition only to not pass terrifies me to the point that I put the thought away and convince myself I'm fine being female.

Similarly, I'm not good at asserting myself, so I'd have a rough time enforcing my pronouns and correcting people if need be. I hate to be a nag or feel like I've said something too many times and have gotten annoying with it. (Not saying that this is how I perceive other trans people when they correct me on pronouns, but it's how I feel I'm being percieved.) I don't mind female pronouns, but it always feels so much better when people refer to me with male pronouns or mistake me for a boy. I like it when I hear a kid ask their mom if I'm a boy or a girl, because it means I'm close to passing. I love when I work customer service and the customer calls me ""young man"" or something of the sort. I have even been going by a male name for 4 years now.

The problem is...I want a male body. But, I want to still wear girly things and makeup. I want to look like a boy, sound like a boy, and have a male body, but I also want to be able to wear makeup and a wig from time to time. I try to tell myself that that stuff doesn't mean I'm not trans, since I can wear makeup and dresses now, but I hate the body underneath. I want to look girly on rare occasions, but I don't want to be a girl.

Can I really say I'm transgender if my ideal image of myself is a male body who occasionally wears women's clothes and makeup? 

I mean my main style is graphic tees and baggy pants, but I'd miss being able to do makeup if I transitioned and I don't feel like that should be something I have to give up, but I also feel like...I'm just kidding myself.",trans,Am I just kidding myself?,1554555417.0,"{'created_utc': 1554530217, 'id': 'ba1crb', 'num_comments': 9, 'score': 8, 'selftext': 'I am AFAB.

 We don't have that much money to spend on me to transition unless I take out a loan from the bank, and that's not for a long time. Another thing is, I don't know when to transition.

A few examples are When I am 23 or 25 (Basically after I finish high school) and I also want to become a famous youtuber or twitch streamer (Which is hard and is like winning the lottery)

but if I do become a youtuber or twitch streamer I'm not sure whether if I should transition before or after starting an online career. 

The fear with both of these options is, If I start out transitioning while starting a youtube career I'm afraid of not becoming popular and no one paying attention to me, but if I get popular on youtube and then transition I'm afraid people will not look at me in the same light as they did once before.

People would still support me, it would be very different though. I know there is a lot of shitty people out in the world, and that is what scares me the most. Being hurt or killed because I'm misunderstood.

I know not everyone would support me being trans, but I feel like we would have to go 100 years in the future just to be able to be happy and live our lives the way we want to. 

Also, there's the other problem about finding a girl that is okay with me being trans and stays with me and is also loyal, but at the same time having an open marriage so we can both be happy and explore our sexualities.

I‚Äôm watching season 2 of The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina on Netflix. There‚Äôs a trans girl named Susie/Theo. I‚Äôm going to use her as my example. 
So Susie is now a boy who goes by Theo. Theo wears ‚Äúboys‚Äù clothes, has what is a traditionally ‚Äúboys‚Äù name, wants to change in the boys locker room, and his main conflict in the show is trying to get onto the boys basketball team. Theo is ridiculed and bullied. He feels he‚Äôs being denied his right to be a boy. 
Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm confused. This comes across as a progressive mindset for gender and trans equality. Is Theo‚Äôs crusade not actually a regressive mindset? Is Theo not actually just reinforcing the gender roles/stereotypes he is opposed to? 
Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm coming from. Theo, formally Susan, now has a ‚Äúboys‚Äù name, wears ‚Äúboys‚Äù clothes, and wants to change in the boys locker room. Theo is assigning himself these traits based on gender stereotypes. The name, the clothes, etc. Would it not be more progressive for Theo to just embrace his biological gender and also wear ‚Äúboys‚Äù clothes and have a ‚Äúboys‚Äù name? Really just to be whatever he wants without defining himself by society‚Äôs gender stereotypes. 
So Theo doesn‚Äôt feel like a girl. He feels like a boy. As he states in the show, he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable in ‚Äúgirls‚Äù clothes. He feels more comfortable in ‚Äúboys‚Äù clothes. So he is assigning a gender to himself based on what is traditionally, and stereotypically, ‚Äúboy‚Äù stuff. This seems like a regressive mindset to me. 
I‚Äôm a male. I am a man. If I grew my hair long, wore dresses, went by Susan, wore makeup, shaved my legs, and started dating men would I not be a man? It seems backwards to me that someone who changes these aspects of themselves ascribes to an outdated idea of what a man and women are. 
It would seem more progressive to me that one embrace their biological gender and wear whatever clothes they want, date whoever they want, wear whatever they want, and grow their hair however they want.

239,2019-04-07 06:31:47,badmvq,4,4,"Howdy! I'm a 19 year old cis male living in Canada. I've lived cis all my life without any problems, always felt male, liked to look male, etc. However, all my life I've acted more typically feminine than my male friends - I like to sing Disney, I care more about organization and manners, and I think dyed hair, make-up, and jewelry is super cool (of those things I've only dyed my hair, though); and little thoughts would pop into my head, telling me things like ""but it would be cool to be a woman"" or ""I wish I was more feminine."" They mostly left my mind within minutes, though. But within the past 6 months I've been looking back on these thoughts as I begin to struggle with my identity.

&amp;#x200B;

It all started with a Snapchat filter (yes, really). One my my friends thought it'd be funny to use one of the filters that made you look more feminine - eyelashes, lipstick, thinner jaw, etc. I laughed when she showed me, because that's what it was supposed to be. But internally, looking at the picture, it made me feel something different. That night I downloaded Snapchat just for the filter and had a mini-photoshoot in my bathroom. I even eventually talked myself into using rolled-up hand towels as fake breasts! (My pants were too tight to do the same for a bigger bum, though)

I did this a couple of nights before the need to be like that faded, and I assumed it was just a weird faze. But it didn't stop me from questioning it for the next few months, thinking about it. ""I'm not trans, though!"" I'd tell myself, ""I hadn't struggled with this for 19 years!"" It didn't stop the voices.

This past week the feelings came back a lot stronger. I tried to ignore it, but that didn't really work. So, to satisfy this feeling, I tried to photoshop a picture of myself to look like a lady (but I don't know how to use photo-editors very well, so that didn't work) I was desperate. The need to be different was exasperated after I saw a video online of someone stuffing balloons down their shirt to look like (clownishly large) breasts. Last night I tried the ol' towel method again, but it just wasn't enough.

So I went out to my local party store - it sells party stuff like streamers, candy, costumes, and - what I originally came there for - balloons. I went to the costume section and bought a cheap wig and some red face paint I had hoped to use as lipstick (the stuff was only $2! much cheaper than real lipstick), and then a pack of balloons (a 30 pack, in case I wanted to try different boob sizes)

I just got back from my little transition party in my bathroom mirror. I had never applied lipstick before - and the stuff I got didn't coat my lips well - but it was passable when I didn't wear my glasses. After trying on the wig, I immediately gained more respect for people who wear their hair long, because that was a mess to deal with. The balloons worked as intended, though I had to be extra careful with them so I wouldn't wake up my family.

After looking at myself in the mirror, finally getting the hair to cooperate, and striking many a pose, I felt sexy. It felt good. I was happy with it. (Though I'm still trying to figure out what to say to my mum if and when she finds the random wig and red paint, but oh well)

&amp;#x200B;

I was originally going to end this off asking you guys if this actually meant I was gender fluid, or what. But as I wrote it, I felt more and more comfortable applying the term to myself. If you've read all this, and you figure that that's wrong, and it doesn't make me gender-fluid, please make sure to tell me (you are the experts, after all!)

The balloons worked as intended, though I had to be extra careful with them so I wouldn\'t wake up my family.\n\nAfter looking at myself in the mirror, finally getting the hair to cooperate, and striking many a pose, I felt sexy. It felt good. I was happy with it. (Though I\'m still trying to figure out what to say to my mum if and when she finds the random wig and red paint, but oh well)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was originally going to end this off asking you guys if this actually meant I was gender fluid, or what. But as I wrote it, I felt more and more comfortable applying the term to myself. If you\'ve read all this, and you figure that that\'s wrong, and it doesn\'t make me gender-fluid, please make sure to tell me (you are the experts, after all!)\n\nThank you for listening to my TED Talk.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My Brief Journey into Gender-Fluidity', 'created': 1554643907.0}"

Yes I dress like a girl and I'm happier when in girl mode (which is almost always even if it's just a lacy thong or girly belly ring)

The advice I'm looking for is basically will I fit in here even tho some could say I'm not really trans cuz I have no plans to take hormones or have surgery (more demigirl or gender fluid I guess tho they are different and I understand the differences I still feel more trans and I'm more comfortable being a ""girl"")

249,2019-04-07 15:36:11,bahgoo,1,3,"Hello everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

Despite the title more than strange (or ridiculous) of this thread, it was a moment that I wanted to post here. 

&amp;#x200B;

Few months ago I watched a movie called ""the Danish girl"" starring with Eddie Redmayne . As I quite appreciate this actor and as I was also curious about the story by itself ( a Danish painter who considered himself, by time to time, as a woman).  It didn't take long for me to choose this movie for my ""*Netflix-couch-potato-night*"". 

And even if I have to admit that the movie by itself was quite entertaining, I was really disappointed by the main character for which his complains was quite a pain in the a\*s. And to be honest I was clearly more concerned by the other character as I considered the behave the main character as quite selfish and destructive both to himself and to his close relatives. 

At first, I was quite like ""... *meh surely that the actor wasn't correctly leaded and that the script was kind of crappy when it comes about the main character*"". And perhaps this very first conclusion was right or at least was part of the answer of why this movie did not  touch me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Still I am not really convinced by my own explanations and I 'm wondering if my lack of empathy was not, instead, due to a lack of knowledge about what transsexuality is.  I mean, I'm a man, with a functional ""*wee-wee*"" and questioning myself about my biological gender is not a thing that I do nor I did. And even if I would surely appreciate having more muscles and a being a little less chubby, I nether considered myself as under a treachery of mother nature who gave my a wrong body. 

&amp;#x200B;

In order to make a link to this title, in France we say ""*√™tre comme une poule devant une fourchette*"" which literally means ""being like a chicken in front of a fork"". And it is exactly my very feeling when it comes about trans people : I see it but still I can't understand it. Therefore, as I haven't got the foggiest idea of what transsexuality is and what trans people have to face it everyday, I don't have any position about it. 

As my mother always told me ""sweetheart you're dumb but fortunately clever enough to realize it"" I decided to create this thread with a simple but ambitious purpose : try to have a better understanding of what trans people have to struggle with on an everyday life but, even more importantly, to discuss with all of you on the most gentle way, full of dignity and mutual respect. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in order to sum-up : please, let me be less dumber by answering to these questions that did cross my mind as I write it down this thread : 

* How did you realize that you were in the wrong body ? Is it something you always knew of is it something that you realize after a specific situation ? 
* It is quite difficult for me to distinguish a person who have dysmorphia from other peoples who, for examples, simply rejects the gender ""etiquette"" or even from transvestite people. What is the difference ? 
* Still on the gender subject, when I think about transexual people I always have an image of a over-gendered person (eg. an an oversampled woman or a too muscular guy etc.) Is it a remarks you had or have to deal ? 
* In France, transsexuality seems to be dealt through a (very) long medical and psychiatrical process. This seems to be quite an issue fro many trans people but, on my mind, I think on the contrary that such process avoid any irreversible decisions made to quickly. Is such approach the same in other country ? 
* During and after an hormone therapy did you notice change (food tasting different, change in the mood and behaviour) etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Before answering to these (surely stupid and overheard) questions,  I have some important things to say before laying down my (surely stupid) questions : 

1. Please notice that English is not my mother tongue. Many misspells , grammatical errors or even vocabulary clumsiness will certainly occur. Do not hesitate to correct me, I will greatly appreciate your corrections in order to improve my English skills. 
2. I will be honest : I'm fully ignorant but I surely know when you're into quite a sensitive subject and I'm quite sure that this threads have its foots fully into a world of sensitiveness. So if some of you consider my word as quite offensive or if you disagree with me, then let me know. 
3. This thread will be under the banner of courtesy and decency. 

&amp;#x200B;

Again thank you for your answers. I'm not sure that I may be able to fully understand you, but at least let us try ! :)

So I don't usually post this kind of thing on Reddit, but I was talking to a trans friend of mine and explaining more or less what my stance on being non-binary was. For context I consider myself to be genderfluid existing between agender and demi-girl and I'll explain exactly what I mean by that in my chart.

https://i.redd.it/012wr70ko1r21.png

So I don't know if this idea has been proposed before or not (like I said I don't visit this subreddit) but this is pretty much what I came up with when trying to describe my understanding of gender. I'd like to know what the community thinks of it and see if they have any critiques or if this triangle leaves anything out that I wasn't aware of. Listed in the upper right corner I have some green symbols which are meant to represent methods of categorizing yourself on this chart. Don't take the symbols literally and only use squares or something they are just meant to represent a boundary.

&amp;#x200B;

So I mentioned earlier that I see myself as genderfluid and this is more or less what I envision when I say that.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/1frlw0pap1r21.png

So note that I consider myself to exist somewhere within this area as indicated by the shape being filled. This pretty much means to me that on any given day I can be anywhere in this general area. I have gender flux listed as a highlighted area without this filled in section. That pretty much just indicates that your gender would land on the corners of the highlighted area to signify the extreme shifts between gender. Also important to note that this highlighted area doesn't have to be a triangle it can be a straight line if you want it to be, my reason for using a triangle was that it makes it easier to tell the difference between gender fluid and gender flux.

So my friend aligns herself with binary female which I envision as existing somewhere near the corners of the triangle overall. I don't really know if I consider agender to be a binary gender or not given that it is the lack of a gender, but I wanted my chart to reflect people who do transition between agender and something else so I do think it should be included in the chart. I also wanted the chart to be pretty simplified because I think that has more mainstream appeal than saying there are 2,000+ genders. I more or less see it as there are 2,000+ combinations for defining yourself on this chart and it really all comes down to how specific you'd like to get in terms of defining your dot or highlighted area. This one seems easy to understand for most people if they are at least open to the idea of a male/female gender spectrum. I should also note that I feel that more people in the world would identify as non-binary so take that as you will. I just see gender as a very nuanced thing as with most aspects of life. I don't know what I would consider the cut off points of where binary ends and non-binary begins though so... That's up for you all to decide I guess. I just made a chart and wanted to see what people thought of it. Thank you for taking the time to read and consider these ideas if you have.

¬†
I wanted to send out a brief email in case you haven‚Äôt heard. I recently came out as transgender. To my friends and family outside of work ‚Äì my name is Veronica, Roni or Ronnie for short.
¬†
I realize that most people don‚Äôt know any trans people, or at least they don‚Äôt know that they know any trans people. I‚Äôm open about myself and my story if you ever want to talk outside of work.
¬†
Basically, what this means is that although my birth certificate and physiology indicate that I‚Äôm male, I‚Äôm actually a woman. I‚Äôve known since I was a kid, but I‚Äôm just now finally at a place in my life where I felt safe sharing this with the world. That‚Äôs kind of my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for starting this journey and sharing it with all of you ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a great feeling to carry around a secret like that every day!
¬†
Anyways ‚Äì I will be changing my name to Veronica. If you all could make an effort to refer to me by that name or by ‚ÄúRoni‚Äù that would be very appreciated. In addition, if you could start using female pronouns (she/her/hers instead of he/him/his) it would mean a lot to me. Slip ups are going to happen ‚Äì it‚Äôs habit, it‚Äôs normal, it‚Äôs not a big deal ‚Äì you don‚Äôt have to apologize if it happens. It will also probably get easier as my appearance changes.
¬†
I haven‚Äôt yet shared this with candidates or clients yet ‚Äì but will be doing so in the near future.¬†
¬†
I‚Äôve also included a handful of resources (attached) if you‚Äôre interested in learning more.
¬†
Looking forward to continuing to work with each of you as a more complete version of myself,

304,2019-04-08 22:12:48,bazwr2,0,4,"I‚Äôm turning 19 this year and for the past 2 I‚Äôve been questioning my gender. I‚Äôve always been pretty clear on my sexuality but gender has always been a bit of a grey area in my brain; now looking back I think my sexuality is also linked to my ‚Äúgender doubts‚Äù. I‚Äôve always had the internal fight between the ideologies that ‚Äúgender is just a dna-thing and we can express ourselves however we want to‚Äù and ‚Äúwe live in a society where gender has a great impact and I can‚Äôt ignore that‚Äù - hence I define myself as Pansexual bc I couldn‚Äôt care less about genitals and I‚Äôm open to always respect my partner. 

Onto my actual gender... it‚Äôs a bit of a mess and I was hoping I could find someone with similar experiences! 

When I was a kid I never cared about clothes and just let my mom pick for me, resulting in a very feminine looking mini-me. Around ages 12 to 14 I picked what was in style at the moment for girls, as that‚Äôs what other people my gender did; but I never was ecstatic about my clothes and never considered it a way I could express myself through. I actually grew up to be a Tom-boy, resenting everything feminine and with the reputation of hating going shopping. I didn‚Äôt care at all about my appearance, although I didn‚Äôt hate the body I was in, just kind of accepted it. On the other side I love working repairs around the house with my dad and anything with wheels I could ride. To add to that, since I was little I‚Äôve loved to daydream and all of the stories in my head feature a masculine protagonist that I impersonate. 

Around age 16 I realized I had a bit of an obsession with anything masculine- I loved how the male body looked and felt a mixture of admiration and wanting to be like that. 

Around last year I let my brain actually listen to it and tried to explore the reasons why I never cared about how I looked and why I didn‚Äôt seem to want to express myself through my appearance (I‚Äôm a very artistic person and I love putting my weird twist on things I own). The conclusion I came up with is that I want to look more masculine. I went shopping without other people‚Äôs judgement in mind and actually enjoyed myself and found peculiar clothing I love (and other people think it‚Äôs ugly but I don‚Äôt care! ) BUT sometimes I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to buy something bc it made me look so female.. and I hate that. Sometimes I wish I could flatten out my boobs ( and I love boobs, just not on me all the time!). I‚Äôve also come to kind of hate my hips (I think they‚Äôre too wide to be androgynous) and how short i am, as I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever pass.

I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm really confused about what I‚Äôm feeling: is it repressed misogyny, disphoria or did I ignore my wishes to be androgynous for too long and now I have to deal with them all at once?

Are all genders classified in relation to the binary of male and female? To elaborate I‚Äôm not saying there‚Äôs only two genders , there are many but my observations have seen most are related to the binary to define them . 

To explain you have female and male genders, other genders are defined as Agender ( a lack of gender presentation) or Non-binary ( acknowledging a gender presentation strictly restricted to female or male genders) some of which are NB masc or NB femme or adrogyne, other cultures I‚Äôve looked at like Two-spirits in some but not all Native American cultures relate their gender towards this binary.

The main question I wanted to pose is, is their a gender identity not related to the binary of male and female? If not it would be possible to represent gender as a gradient with male on one side and female on the other , Demigirls, Demiboys, and Nonbinary would be spread through the middle likely overlapping with each other and a dot outside for Agender ,  i don‚Äôt know if such a graph would accurately represent all gender presentations and would likely need refinement regardless, but it would greatly help explain gender visually,

So I'm trans, f2m, and am thinking of transitioning.

The pains/symptoms are kind of like an aftermath/echo from a 2-year period when I was not taking good care of myself: learned my lesson and am now giving my body back the healthy lifestyle it needs. There are no heart diseases in my family that I should otherwise be worried about.

340,2019-04-09 19:44:31,bbcdvi,18,6,"I had this encounter at a university recently.  I saw someone who seemed, to my eyes, to be an extremely graceful, lovely woman. I was sort of taken aback by her sense of style (which was very resident with my own).  As I normally would, whenever I encounter someone who I think looks beautiful, or is dressed in a pleasing manner, I told her she looked very pretty.  It was only when I made eye contact with her that I happened to notice how tall she was; only then did I realize that she was likely trans.  I probably wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't looking for it, or there hadn't been any obvious cues.

Well we were speaking, I saw this *look* in her eyes; in an instant, we'd had this ""exchange of awareness"".  She realize that I had identified her as female organically- that I might have even assumed that she was born that way, and was fairly relieved.  All at once I saw joy, sorrow, hope and fear and her expression, and she very nervously started to ask me a question, but trailed off. It *seemed* as though she was starting to ask me whether or not I had realized that she was trans, and then decided against it. I questioned her on it, since she was mumbling and I didn't realize at first what she had been saying, and in a somewhat deflated tone she said ""never mind"".

I couldn't help but wonder if the reason she didn't want me to know that she was trans was because she was afraid of potential judgment. It seems more likely that she was anticipating a shift in my attitude- that she assumed I was only friendly toward her because I apparently didn't realize that she was trans.

In that moment, I wasn't really sure what to say. What would've been more reassuring? To directly acknowledge that she was trans, and therefore be one of the people who supports her/someone she is able to potentially relax around? Or to leave it alone? What might've been more hurtful? Yet another reminder of the fact that she wasn't born female (ie: ""where you about to say that you're trans?""), or if he ambiguity of wondering whether or not she was expected to *hide* this aspect of her being?

I mean, truthfully, she did ""pass"".

I probably wouldn\'t have noticed if I wasn\'t looking for it, or there hadn\'t been any obvious cues.\n\nWell we were speaking, I saw this *look* in her eyes; in an instant, we\'d had this ""exchange of awareness"".  She realize that I had identified her as female organically- that I might have even assumed that she was born that way, and was fairly relieved.  All at once I saw joy, sorrow, hope and fear and her expression, and she very nervously started to ask me a question, but trailed off. It *seemed* as though she was starting to ask me whether or not I had realized that she was trans, and then decided against it. I questioned her on it, since she was mumbling and I didn\'t realize at first what she had been saying, and in a somewhat deflated tone she said ""never mind"".\n\nI couldn\'t help but wonder if the reason she didn\'t want me to know that she was trans was because she was afraid of potential judgment. It seems more likely that she was anticipating a shift in my attitude- that she assumed I was only friendly toward her because I apparently didn\'t realize that she was trans.\n\nIn that moment, I wasn\'t really sure what to say. What would\'ve been more reassuring? To directly acknowledge that she was trans, and therefore be one of the people who supports her/someone she is able to potentially relax around? Or to leave it alone? What might\'ve been more hurtful? Yet another reminder of the fact that she wasn\'t born female (ie: ""where you about to say that you\'re trans?""), or if he ambiguity of wondering whether or not she was expected to *hide* this aspect of her being?\n\nI mean, truthfully, she did ""pass"".  After a very close look I noticed some things, but *only* giveaway was her height.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Have any of you ever ""passed"" and then been afraid to let the other person know that you\'re trans?', 'created': 1554864271.0}"
341,2019-04-09 20:13:10,bbcqmv,6,3,"So, I recently began to question because I have noticed that when doing sexual activities, I always image myself as a female. wanting breasts and curves and everything a woman has. I usually experience body disphoria after this. However, any other time, I am a functional male and I don't think about it. I'm happy with my life at the moment, but I'm beginning to notice increasing thoughts of being a girl in different aspects of life. for example, feeling envious of girls talking about leggings, wanting to have breasts and, when going to the toilet, feeling uncomfortably aware of my genetalia.

This has been occurring for the past few months now, and I'm scared. I'm content with myself but I'm not sure if identifying as trans would make me feel any better or worse.
Thing is, I don't really want to do ""girly things"". I just sometimes want a body of a woman, and wear some feminine clothes.

My confusion has also been twisted by social media. for example, seeing a picture of a fit dude makes me feel like
""damn, he is good looking... I could try and work out to look like him and I'd feel good about it.""
but I could say the exact same about a picture of a girl.

I wouldn't mind taking HRT to feminise myself but firstly it's almost impossible for me to get and I'd be scared of people noticing the effects, especially my family.

I've heard of a phrase called ""autogynephilia"" and I'm not sure if this applies to me or if the whole thing is just not real.

sorry if this was a waste of time. just kinda needed to let this out somehow.

Hello. I‚Äôm a 17 year old trans guy. A have a bad and abusive relationship with my mother, who is a bigot, and a good relationship with my father.

My dad is already suing my mom for custody and has a court date tomorrow. I know you might be thinking. It‚Äôs pointless and expensive to try to get custody of me at my age. I don‚Äôt need that lecture as he‚Äôs already doing it and set on doing so.

Here‚Äôs the thing: he doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm trans. And he wants me to help him compile a list of ‚Äúgrievances‚Äù against my mother so he has a better chance of getting custody.

I‚Äôm unsure that I should come out to him. Part of me feels like he would have a better chance of getting custody if the judge knew I was trans and that my mom is really bigoted towards trans people. But another part of me worries that the judge will be transphobic too and think I‚Äôm lying and just trying to live with someone who will ‚Äúenable my disorder.‚Äù

I‚Äôm also worried if he doesn‚Äôt get custody. Then my mom will find out I‚Äôm trans as well and probably tell the rest of my family, who are also transphobic.

There‚Äôs about 17 hours until the hearing, and I can realistically come out to him no later than about 11-13 hours from now, and I‚Äôm still undecided.

If you have any advice, or have been in a situation like this before, could you share? I‚Äôd really appreciate it. I just want to know what other people would do in this situation. Just support is also appreciated.

I feel like most LGBT view points suggest that men and women shouldn't be discriminated against/trying to break down the social boundaries between the 2.

Like, people born as men identify themselves as women because they identify themselves as appealing to the norm of female gender (having feminine qualities) roles and vice versa.

So I'm AMAB, and started actually questioning my gender very recently after having spent a long time convincing myself I'm cis. There's a lot going on in my head right now, but there's one specific thing that I think I want to talk about, because I'm not sure of its implications.

Right now I identify as straight, meaning I'll probably be a lesbian if I transition. This is relevant to the Thing I'm about to talk about, which is a thing that may have been 'Trans foreshadowing', or it may not have been.

When I was a few years younger than I am now (I'm still young now, whatever) I used to have these, daydreams I guess, where I would wake up in the body of a girl I had a crush on at the time. It wasn't always the same girl, you know how crushes are.

Now, the thing with these fantasies was: they were usually somewhat sexual in nature, often involving masturbation. Because of this fact, I don't know if these fantasies were the result of me wanting to be a woman, or just me being a straight male teenager.

On top of that, the fantasies frequently involved trying to switch back, but I think that was more of a ""returning to 'me'"" thing than a ""returning to male"" thing.

I still /feel/ like a girl. Sometimes I feel like I should just stop transitioning and maybe that would be better for me, maybe the gender confusion will go away, but I'm too anxious because I've been out for so long.
I feel like this confusion might also stem from the fact that I didn't really give myself an ""egg"" phase, as I figured myself out while I was deep into Tumblr at the time and immediately labelled myself as a hyperfeminine genderfluid boi for a while before coming to the conclusion that I was transmale, so it's manifesting now.

Went to my favorite bar last night, not an lgbtq+ bar, but I know a lot of the bartenders and they are good people and most know what I am trans and are supportive, for cis people.  Bartender says I look pretty and complements my hair. Then he says that he is excited I am transitioning and tells me that he's there for me if I ever need anything.  He seems drunk but is super nice, I am feeling great.  Then he says he has a trans niece who is 15, and asks me if she can call me.  Naturally I tell him I can help in any way and there she can call or text any time.  Seems like she has just came out, but her mom was being supportive and he sounded supportive.  I was psyched, I wanted to be there for her any way I could and help her get through stuff since I assume coming at 15 would be intense and people at school are really shitty.

Next thing I know he is not working and come up crying, I take him outside the bar and he just looks at me with this face I won't forget and says that she's gone.  That she killed herself.

I was always so sad that I missed out growing up female.  I came out recently at 29 and it's been pretty easy for me since I have already chosen good people as my friends who have been supportive so I haven't really experienced much transphobia.

Now I don't even know how to feel.  I'm fucking pissed, how dare these people she went to school with make her go this far and feel this way.  Why is this shit still happening?

I don't really have much to say, just needed to vent this.  I want to do something to help in some way to keep things like this from happening, but I don't know how.

I made this post (/r/asktransgender/comments/az5o4s/am_i_really_transgender/) some weeks ago because I started to question whether I was really trans. After the positive messages I felt better and stopped thinking about it, but now I‚Äôm back at it and it‚Äôs worse than before.

My mind keeps insisting I‚Äôm a woman, I keep misgendering myself unconsciously and even going as far as labeling my attraction for girls as ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù and my attraction for guys as ‚Äústraight‚Äù. It‚Äôs horrible and it distresses me to no end, but at this point I can‚Äôt even truly consider myself a real man/male, because my body doesn't feel appropriate. I know I‚Äôm a man, or so I want to believe, but I can‚Äôt fight back the other thoughts and it makes me confused.

I look at other guys and wish I could be like them. But then I look at girls and wish I could be like them too.

I‚Äôve been reading detransition stories, but I can‚Äôt really relate to them. It‚Äôs all about butches who define themselves as being confused, ‚Äútransitioning‚Äù to escape gender roles and avoid judgement for being masculine, or stories about wanting to escape patriarchal oppression and internal misogyny. I‚Äôve never been stereotypically masculine and I don‚Äôt believe in gender roles, so I know that‚Äôs not a problem. I‚Äôve never been exclusively attracted to women, so it‚Äôs not about being ashamed of my sexuality. I‚Äôve never felt being a man would make my life easier (it sure would, but it‚Äôs not something I care about), but maybe I do have internalized misogyny? I don‚Äôt know. I look at muscled women, masculine women, lesbians, bisexual girls, physically androgynous women and any other type of women that aren‚Äôt ‚Äústereotypical‚Äù and I think they‚Äôre pretty cool. In a way I wish I could be like them, but I know it‚Äôs not possible because I don‚Äôt feel like a woman.

Before coming out I had a period of hyper femininity and it wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable. I‚Äôve been thinking of trying it out again... It scares me though. If it wasn‚Äôt for me and I went like that in public I‚Äôd freak out, and dressing up like I used to in private wouldn‚Äôt really tell me anything.

Is my hatred for my body even real? What if I‚Äôve just convinced myself I‚Äôm trans and therefore, to pretend discomfort? Could it be possible being happy with your assigned gender while desiring being the other sex? At this point I even wonder if I really dislike my body and if I‚Äôd just rather have a male one, or if I‚Äôm a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù who simply wouldn‚Äôt like to be treated or perceived as such (like he/him lesbians and all that).

As a side note, I‚Äôm diagnosed with depression and anxiety, but I started completely skipping my meds since December (bad decision, I know, no need for lectures). I tend to expose myself and participate in political discourse too, which means I often read transphobic things. Could this be influencing my feelings? Am I genuinely confused/questioning, or is it the dysphoria (no longer suppressed by meds) and internalized transphobia that is fueling my fears and doubts? In case of the latter, any tips on how to cope and stop invalidating myself?

507,2019-04-14 04:52:26,bczdyp,5,3,"Hi there,

So here's my situation: I'm about to go to Spain (flying out 4 days from now) to get FFS with FacialTeam. Based on the results I expect, I'll be outed pretty much within seconds of coming back. There's a good chance that my voice will MOSTLY pass (hopefully I'll be far enough out from surgery that this won't be an issue) but that's it. My body is maaaybe decently well passing if you ignore the mediocre boobs. I have a limited wardrobe but it'll do for work - I'll have some time to pick up a few extra pairs of good jeans and that sort of thing. I'll hopefully know some basic makeup by that time, too (I've got an in-person course scheduled + already done some research).

Essentially, this is gonna be tough. Most likely, I'm walking into being a non-passing visibly trans cashier. Oh boy.

But I do have some advantages going for me. My employers/employees already know I'm quite feminine - I'm also very open about being bi to a 100% positive response so far. I'm also not bothered with being misgendered early - it's just the direct hostility I'm not sure I'm ready for.

As I see it, I have a few approaches to this situation.

1. The nuclear option: I don't tell anyone and just show up to work looking all purty with a new face.
2. The stealthy nuclear option: I don't tell anyone and just try to get away with being androgynous while I cover all the rest of my bases.
3. The totally-what-I-should-do-but-dreading-this-email option: Email my boss, and show up to work in a pride pin and some dope clothes, and let the world come at me.
4. The wuss-out-but-also-reasonable option: Email my boss, dress androgynous, answer questions directly, and try to be a little less conspicuously feminine so fewer customers give me shit.

Maybe I can make some people happy and not be considered such a prude.\n\nAm I worrying about this too much? Is dissociation actually more common and not that big of a deal? Is it what I *should* be doing anyway because having a happy partner should be more important? Does it actually work?\n\nI really don\'t want to hear things like ""you shouldn\'t be dissociating"" and ""it\'s not good for you"". Yeah, ok, I get it. Whatever. I\'m also alone and have been my whole life. Maybe I just need to get over myself, bite the bullet, and think of England. Maybe it\'s just the price I have to pay to not be alone anymore. If I love and care about someone, I should be able to do it, right?\n\nSurgery is never going to be an option because 1) I\'ll never be able to afford it and 2) It doesn\'t provide what I need anyway so there\'s no point in trying to wait for something that\'s not going to happen.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Is dissociation a valid sexual strategy?

529,2019-04-14 16:58:42,bd4tle,5,0,"hello people of r/trans im a curious 18 year old cis male who is trying to write a commentary or at least a clear explanation of various topic. ive been working on it fo about 5 month now and i plan to finish it when im probably 25 because of well the depths of the subjects i talk about and how much in depth i want to go. 

one of those topic is the subject of gender identity and sexuality. so i have a couple of questions regarding the trans perspective and the effects of others who do not share this perspective on the behaviours of these people. so if u people will have me i have some questions.

1. Does the aesthethic of a ""male"" or ""female""  matter to u in terms of helping u pass and if so to what degree?

2. Various people in ur life will say u dont meet the perceptional cues needed to consider u male enough or female enough ( whatever those definitions may be) what weights does it have in ur eyes? and how does this affect u playing into the aesthetic i refered to in the previous question?

3. Various people have different weights on what these perceptional cues are, so are they justified in saying the trans individual doesn‚Äôt meet said standard?. 

4. If the answer to the question \[ii\] is yes then does that then mean that certain perceptional cues have more value than others? If yes do we list them? And which ones have more value and why?

5. If you answer to the question \[ii\] is no then how can we reconcile with these individuals in their wrong doing? Do we still need to define the specific cues that matter and why? Do we need to reconcile with the perceiver in his value of the cues or with the trans individual in the expression of the right cues?

some of the questions may be open ended or may seem obvious but i dont belive the answer is always clear cut. and im trying to create a stable unchanging/reliable standard. i dont mean to offend anyone with the questions. im simply trying to create at least a fair describtion. if some of the questions are too open ended or too vague u can point out how and ill do my best to clarify. if u outright dont understand ill also try to explain further. if its stupid then im sorry for asking stupid questions lol.",trans,I have some inquiries about the trans perspective.,1555286322.0,"{'created_utc': 1555261122, 'id': 'bd4tle', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'hello people of r/trans im a curious 18 year old cis male who is trying to write a commentary or at least a clear explanation of various topic. ive been working on it fo about 5 month now and i plan to finish it when im probably 25 because of well the depths of the subjects i talk about and how much in depth i want to go. \n\none of those topic is the subject of gender identity and sexuality. so i have a couple of questions regarding the trans perspective and the effects of others who do not share this perspective on the behaviours of these people. so if u people will have me i have some questions.\n\n1.

I am the president of a collegiate student organization that advocates for and spreads awareness of issues affecting women and women identifying people around the world.  To do this we operate in committees corresponding to particular issues, one of them being Women‚Äôs Health.

Currently, our executive board is having a discussion about renaming our Women‚Äôs Health Committee to just the Health Committee. Previously this committee was called the Reproductive Health Committee but we changed it to its current title because not all women have reproductive abilities and wanted to be more trans inclusive. 

Now the discussion has shifted to dropping women from the title all together since some health issues that typically affect cis women can also affect trans men. I have no problem with incorporating trans men and other AFAB individuals into the dialogue if we‚Äôre doing an event on a typical women‚Äôs health issue that affects them as well, however, it‚Äôs really important to me that we stay focused on our mission which is to advocate for women and women identifying people.

My position is that we should limit the scope of the committee to women and women identifying people and include AFAB people in dialogue when it‚Äôs appropriate. I feel like if we drop women from the title of the committee it not only deviates from the focus our mission but it also can create the dangerous assertion that trans men or other AFAB people are actually women by proxy and want to avoid

I just want to ensure that were being inclusive and sensitive to trans folks while still staying true to our mission of advocating on the behalf of women and women identifying people. Since I am a cis woman can provide no perspective on how this actually affects the individuals that are the subject of the discussion, I wanted to get some thoughts that are fare more valid than my own.

it's too late to start calling courts and city halls right now so im trying to start the process to see if ANYBODY has any information. i've already changed my name legally and ive been on hormones for 3 months, but i want to help my boyfriend who is frustrated and left in the dust by the people around him who wont support him.

&amp;#x200B;

665,2019-04-18 13:32:10,bellkw,2,3,"Crosspost from r/lgbt. Also should note that I am not trans.

Obligatory ""mobile formatting"" etc. etc.

One of my best friends' dysphoria has evidently gotten very bad the past few weeks and I just found out yesterday. It is now to the point where he literally cannot function without his binder on. His general body image issues are also not helping, as he is not a very masculine-presenting guy despite being a transman and societal pressures on what ""male"" looks like make him feel like shit because he just flat-out doesn't have that body type. He's not allowed to get top surgery (the only surgery he wants) or even start a GoFundMe for it until puberty is over because of his mom not understanding and not being willing to try to understand. Same with getting testosterone. 

What's more and worse is that he has a history of self-harm. He's been ""clean"" for awhile now and got rid of his blades and stuff but he's now starting to feel the need to start doing it again. He promised me he won't because he doesn't have anything to do it with, and I take his word. I'm family-friends with our town's police chief and many of the officers, so I can get a detail out to his house in an instant if it was really dire anyhow. 

But my question is: how can I help? I'm the only person he is comfortable ranting to about all this (that's sort of my role through my whole friend group), but I feel like all I can say is ""That sucks"" or ""Everything's gonna be OK"" and I know that's not enough. As a cis man, its tough for me to really understand what he's going through and i want to be able to help, but with his mom pretty much not giving a shit about his mental health it's very tough.

Also should note that I am not trans.\n\nObligatory ""mobile formatting"" etc. etc.\n\nOne of my best friends\' dysphoria has evidently gotten very bad the past few weeks and I just found out yesterday. It is now to the point where he literally cannot function without his binder on. His general body image issues are also not helping, as he is not a very masculine-presenting guy despite being a transman and societal pressures on what ""male"" looks like make him feel like shit because he just flat-out doesn\'t have that body type. He\'s not allowed to get top surgery (the only surgery he wants) or even start a GoFundMe for it until puberty is over because of his mom not understanding and not being willing to try to understand. Same with getting testosterone. \n\nWhat\'s more and worse is that he has a history of self-harm. He\'s been ""clean"" for awhile now and got rid of his blades and stuff but he\'s now starting to feel the need to start doing it again. He promised me he won\'t because he doesn\'t have anything to do it with, and I take his word. I\'m family-friends with our town\'s police chief and many of the officers, so I can get a detail out to his house in an instant if it was really dire anyhow. \n\nBut my question is: how can I help? I\'m the only person he is comfortable ranting to about all this (that\'s sort of my role through my whole friend group), but I feel like all I can say is ""That sucks"" or ""Everything\'s gonna be OK"" and I know that\'s not enough. As a cis man, its tough for me to really understand what he\'s going through and i want to be able to help, but with his mom pretty much not giving a shit about his mental health it\'s very tough.

I am coming here to bring a question that I've pestered many friends and otherwise with for probably 5 years now. I may be transgender, but I don't know how to know. I am born male, and currently am biologically, but over the past years through high school I have really came in touch with my feminine side, and for the past 4 or 5 years of fascination, have always been juggling with the idea that I could be trans. Now I want to say I have no problem with the fact that I could be, but I really dont want to jump the gun. Ive struggled with depression for a little longer than what ive had these thoughts, but while many of my issues came and went, this gender disconnect had always been there. I want to say this dilemma is the current cause of my depression, along with my anxiety. I have recently over the past year really been trying to explore that side of myself, through crossdressing and whatnot. I am affectionately the ""trap"" of my friends group (a term i used first, and one we all use lovingly and kept separate from trans people), and while we all like to use that sort of trope, they also understand that it does go deeper than just being a crossdresser and they have all been incredibly supportive. Theyve encouraged me to feel comfortable and dress around them and they were the first group ive ever crossdressed with, and it felt wonderful, and fun, and exciting. Additionally ive also been playing with using she/her pronouns, and when someone does use them for me it makes me light up tbh. I love getting ma'am-ed by accident bc of my long hair, or when people say they thought I was a girl... But I'm not sure if all of that is because I enjoy the attention? Or maybe the illusion i give off? Or is it because I really am a girl at my heart? Ive consulted a lot of friends and have done a lot of soul searching... But idk how to know...

I've never really been comfortable being myself and in that body and it got to boiling point where I didn't understand what I was and I couldn't bear to be out for too long at a time before I just couldn't. (Luckily my school has a sort of place you can relax/study if you need it, I'm so thankful for that) The pressure of being that persona to everyone was to the point where I couldn't breathe or concentrate.

&amp;#x200B;

Now at the same time I had nearly no contact with my girlfriend because not only had I not seen her in a long time, I had no phone/computer to text and the calls kept becoming more and more sparse and short. (Which I regret so god damn much) I couldn't handle talking to her because she knew me as what I was not and talking to her brought out the feeling of what I wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned however that not talking at all made it worse between us and I couldn't really progress at all due to talking to her as someone I'm not and not getting help from someone who is really close to me. I told her exactly what was going on and she understood very well, and has supported me so much.

&amp;#x200B;

She offered letting me be referred to as she/her for a day which I took straight away. She gave me suggestions for female names which made me incredibly happy. She helped with feeling more female. (Shaving, clothing, she said we're gonna go shopping for panties and bras) When we were talking about going out she said that she's gonna go out with her **girlfriend.** She said that and it made me so crazy happy I couldn't stop crying.

This is a serious question I have. I have been thinking about this for a while now.

For one, I honestly don't know if I'm a man or a woman, I really don't feel like I'm a woman, though I like being one, but I also sometimes fantasize about being a man and having a sharp jawline and having a traditionally masculine body. I feel like I'm just making up my ""dysphoria"" because I want to be edgy. I've cried over this confusion many times.

I wonder if this is due to societal expectations of what a woman or a man is and should look like etc.

The only difference aside from biological between men and women are the genders that society created. Isn't gender supposed to be a societal construct? Then why do trans people exist? If there were no societal constructs for gender, would there be less trans people or none at all because we'd just be people, not men and women?

For years I‚Äôve been what I considered to be a ‚Äúfeminine boy‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt really have a name for what I was to be honest other than that. I went with boy because that‚Äôs what I was assigned at birth. Now for a little back story. As a child I always saw my idols as being women. Sailor moon was someone I looked up to greatly. I wanted to be like her so bad. Wear a cute outfit and fight evil. I was so intrigued with the idea of being a powerful girl. Since preschool all my friends were girls. I started to become very shy around males (I still am till this day) and would get anxiety when I would be put in groups with them.  I was also really interested in makeup. I didn‚Äôt really care for the clothes though. Growing up it was evident I was not even remotely close to being masculine. I would hate having facial hair (which btw I really want to get removed via laser still) and would constantly shave everything. Also a red flag for me was when I started being referred to as a ‚Äúman‚Äù by my family. I would shudder at that thought. I even remember telling my mom once to just please call me a boy as if a boy wasn‚Äôt as bad as a man in my head. Still till this day I absolutely hate it. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a man at all. The thing is I don‚Äôt (know) think I‚Äôm a woman either. Yes I love generally feminine things but I don‚Äôt necessarily care for being a women but the thing is I don‚Äôt think or care for being a guy. I think the proper name is non binary or non conforming I‚Äôm not too sure? I recently finally went to a therapist because I was over being stressed everyday. See I‚Äôm the type of person that researches a bunch and is really introverted so not a lot of people even know. Anyways I see this therapist and I tell him how I‚Äôm feeling and he looks so confused. I told him I thought I was trans and how I wasn‚Äôt necessarily a girl but not a guy and that I wanted to keep my genitalia but start hormones. He instantly said, ‚Äùwell that‚Äôs good I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt even make it look right... why mutilate yourself‚Äù. All I could do was change the subject.

For some background on my situation, here's an older post I made (sorry if links aren't allowed, I just don't want to copy-paste it into this, or type it out again as it's pretty long to cover all the crap)[https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/alya8y/in\_need\_of\_advice/efkt0ck/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/alya8y/in_need_of_advice/efkt0ck/?context=3)

I was going to post sooner, however, I did have a major crisis and got out of an inpatient stay for my other mental health problems at the end of February. More has added into this story, and I'm at a loss. No worries, I'm not in crisis or anything that would require a medical professional. I'm now terrified of my situation.

Changes worth noting:

\-I have landed a full-time job

\-I now have a vehicle, however, it needs a lot of work done and I cannot use it to travel long distances (meaning for me around 20 miles)

\-I never moved out, but I'll get into that a bit more.

Just to save myself later on - I'm no longer even socially transitioning due to other beliefs coming to life by those around me. It's eating me alive and I'm working on budgeting in a psychiatrist to hopefully help me. I'm also moving in with my SO who keeps re-enforcing that they're not going anywhere, despite everything. I'm still insanely uncomfortable there and it's only gotta worsen with some family issues that has happened within that household. I'm pretty sure other members in the house have started using meth again, and it's extremely crammed as is with space. One that's a major issue's room is actually right next to mine and my SO's, he's someone with a severe learning disability and acts very lewd around me and others constantly. I do have a past with abuse of the same nature. I would move out completely, but now my family has told me I'm not allowed to move out.  
Another major thing is my grandmother has now bluntly said, word for word ""all these transgenders should be murdered, they are a disgrace and deserve to be punished by death.""

I'm not safe anywhere, and I know my mental health is only going to get worse at this point. I don't know if I should give up, bite my tongue, and start acting in the image my family/SO prefers, or really what to do. I've had more bills come up, I'm being garnished, and I really don't make enough to survive alone. I bring home maybe $900 a month so saving up and moving away just isn't an option.

One Halloween back in college, a girl friend and I swapped clothes and dressed each other up as the other's gender as a costume. She did a really good job, straightening my hair and doing my makeup, to the point where people at parties who didn't already know me (and even one who did) just thought I was some girl who didn't get dressed up as anything, and it turned out, that made me really happy. 

Whenever I see women on TV or out in public or basically anywhere, my first thought is always, ""I wish I looked like that"". It's a pang of sadness every time, but every couple months, it'll send me into a deeper funk for a few weeks, and I'll go back to reading about transitioning and considering whether I should be doing something.

887,2019-04-24 14:33:56,bgvc9u,19,10,"Hi guys. 

I really need to figure out if I'm wrong or not. (TL;DR below)

&amp;#x200B;

I've been through my ""phase"" when I was younger with depression lasting from when I was 8 to 21. (Only thing that changed was my girlfriend)

Although I was diagnosed with Asperger due to my depression and my passion for music + my social skills when I was young. (I'm extremely extrovert now and can't live a day without socializing)

&amp;#x200B;

I came out to my girlfriend about my dysphoria and that I've always felt like a woman but never appreciated my body or the way society wants me to be like (the standard guy meets girl, marriage, do guy things and such).

She was extremely supportive and has been helping me the past weeks until I had an appointment with my doctor to get through the system with ""diagnosis"" and hormones...

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I was at the doctor today and he said it was common for people (especially cis men) with Asperger to be questioning their gender and have gender dysphoria despite not wishing to transition... He was very reluctant to send me further to a psychiatrist that would do an evaluation of me.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a hundred percent sure that I'm a woman inside and that its want I want to do but I'm afraid they will judge my Asperger Syndrome and not judge me on my wishes and dire need of help.

&amp;#x200B;

I told him everything, that I was suicidal in periods and that I literally think that without the treatment, I'll do something harmful to myself because I can't stand to live in this situation any longer and that I want treatment within the next year.

My family is very religious and very anti-lgbt+.

It would probably put me in a dangerous situation if they found out that I was part of the community.

So, how do I go about getting one?

I can't order one online,
Because they check EVERY package that comes through the mail,
Even if it's not addressed to them.

And there's nowhere around where I live where I can get just buy one up.

And I have to be VERY careful about this,

I live in a very rural town (closet gas station is a 42minute walk away),

It's a VERY small, ""tight knit"" Christan/Amish, community.

So, if my parents find out, EVERYONE in town will find out about me.

And, I don't think I'll be safe if that happens.

894,2019-04-24 19:12:57,bgyohl,2,3,"Sorry if this isn't the correct place for this post and I'm taking up space. This is my first post to reddit. I joined earlier today.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a bisexual cis? woman? and I'm feeling extremely confused and hoping members of this community might be willing to help. I recently became good friends with a trans woman and then developed some extremely, inappropriately intense feelings for her (especially inappropriate because I am married to a man I love). I've had crushes before but this is the first time I believe I would have actually gone through with anything physical if she'd felt about me the way I feel about her. It was unbelievably intense, she pushed back, we talked about it, I also really really like her as a friend and a person so we kept hanging out.

&amp;#x200B;

Based on some conversations, primarily although at the time unconsciously initiated by me, I think it's possible that the reason my feelings were so intense was because it felt like we had a lot of shared experiences in terms of how we felt about ourselves and our bodies. My feelings mellowed a bit and lost the crazy intensity but I was still pretty into her. I also was daydreaming at some point and picked a name that would be my boy name although obviously I'm not a boy, but I told her and she started using that name and it felt AMAZING. Hearing (seeing in texts) myself referred to by that name gave me intense feelings, literally physical sensations. We also went shopping and I put on a men's shirt and tie and wow it felt really good. We hung out with some friends, I got drunk and I'm not exactly sure what happened but I think she saw me looking at her and figured out that I still have pretty strong feelings so we're going to take a few weeks apart so I can sort myself out, which is definitely the right choice and honestly I'm ashamed this is a boundary she has to set. I love my husband and I have never come particularly close to anything like this before. I need to get over it and move on.

&amp;#x200B;

So the problem is, I don't know if the feelings are because I like her so much or if I am so intensely drawn to her because of something in me. One hard thing is since we're not talking for a few weeks no one will call me by my other name but I can't tell anyone else and I probably never will. I don't know if I liked hearing it because I have such ridiculous feelings and her having a special name for me tapped into that, or if it's the name itself. I've also spent the last few days feeling like I'm going to have a panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I actually don't think I'm trans. I hate my body but only because it's fat and disgusting and hairy, not because it's female. I don't hate my boobs and I like painting my toenails and I've enjoyed wearing makeup sometimes, and I don't think I want to be physically male. I really don't think I want a penis. I think I like attention and talking about myself, and that's probably also why I'm posting this. I think I've played up some of this so that I'm more interesting to a pretty girl I really like. I am interested in the idea of identities and changing myself, like when I was a kid I'd dye my hair a lot, so I think I'm just playing with this idea now because it's interesting in the abstract. I'm pretty sure I'm cis and talking about this is just a fun game to play, and then I think about how I felt when she said the other name. I felt giddy and tingly. I'm feeling panicky about posting this question and I don't know why I'd feel panicky if I weren't afraid to learn something I don't want to know, but I'm still pretty sure I'm cis.

&amp;#x200B;

It also doesn't matter. I'm not male and, even if I were, I'm married to a cishet man with whom I have a life. I love him more than anything and I can't believe how crazy I've gone for this woman, but I have. I can't believe I'm posting this question, but I'm scared and confused and I have no one else to ask. I also miss my friend as a friend and I feel lonely not talking to her even if it's the right thing. I'm terrified to post this because I'm afraid of how people will respond and that it might confirm something I don't want to be true. I also honestly, truly don't think it's true, but then I wonder why I can't breathe properly. I would really appreciate any feedback people have.

920,2019-04-25 04:32:42,bh4hv8,2,1,"Long post, tl;dr at bottom

MTF, I've been living with my parents since graduation (2015). Currently I'm almost 7 months into HRT. I would have preferred that I started when I moved out, but depression and a series of low-paying jobs never got me the job that would get me there, despite AS and BA degrees, so I didn't want to delay myself any longer. I've had a suspicion that my mother somehow knew that I was trans a while ago, but she never questioned me on anything.

Last Friday I wore a women's blazer that I thought was gender-neutral enough for me to wear without question (black, light-weight, nothing fancy), and because I thought I looked good for the first time in a long time. However my mother noticed right away before I left early to help with Good Friday service. When my mother came in, it was clear that she had been crying; wiping eyes, father's hand on her back. She sat on the opposite side of the church, not next to me, who was visibly sitting by the doors.

She didn't talk to me for the rest of the night and following morning. Later she told me that if I wore a women's blazer to a job interview (like I had mentioned earlier) I wasn't really serious about getting a job. I reluctantly went to my next interview in a men's blazer, but our relationship hasn't been the same. Her adamant disapproval at wearing a blazer, and not being able to even sit next to me caused me to distance myself from her, and she's been stand-offish at times.

I understand that as a parent she's worried for my well-being, and her crying could be from the fact that she now *definitely* suspects I'm trans. I never wanted to tell them until I was off on my own so they wouldn't worry, and it might feel weird in general. However it feels like we both know the truth, and neither of us want to say it for various reasons. She asks if there's anything I want to tell her, and that she worries about me. I've already came out to my brother in fear that they'll tell him first, but should I just come out to them?

In my country I need a referral from my GP to go to a clinic), where I had only a single goal: to tell another living person that I was transgender. I felt nervous as hell, as I've always been deeply shameful and secretive about that part of myself, and whenever I could gather my thoughts long enough, I'd rehearse the conversation over and over. I explained how I could basically trace every mental block, obsessive behavior, lack of fulfillment, and so on, back to this issue. How it makes so much sense when viewed with being transgender in mind, when before nothing made any sense whatsoever.

She was very understanding of my position, obviously, and I was very pleased she didn't try to force some theory or another on to me, or worse, be dismissive of it. Even if she didn't necessarily have any specialized knowledge, she really helped me see how my inner critic - the one who makes sure i conform to others' expectations and don't step out of line - works, and how that too, is not something I should try to get rid of, but instead embrace it as a part of myself without letting it keep me from realizing myself. It's an inner voice that's only been trying to keep me safe from rejection from others, and that included making sure this part of me never saw the light of day. These 2 opposing sides within me, have been in a constant struggle for 15 years, constantly building on one side only to be matched on the other, until I myself was completely drained from energy. This concept basically convinced me once and for all that I have to seek to embrace every part of myself and gather the fragments to make a whole person, regardless of how this inner voice thinks others are gonna react to it. All in all I was very surprised by how far we got in just 50 minutes.

This was the biggest single step I've taken in all of my 28 years of living regarding this. Next step is my appointment with my GP for a referral to a gender clinic in 2 weeks time for further psychological assessment and possibly HRT if I pass their criteria.

Thanks for reading, and to all of you for your stories I finally built enough courage to go through with this. I hope mine can somehow contribute to that even a tiny bit for someone.

To  be clear I'm not confused about my gender or sex. I'm a ""CIS"" Male or  whatever. I was born with a penis and I'm happy with it.

I'm a little confused about my sexuality and what is currently considered conventionally acceptable.

I'm  writing this as I think it out so I'll do this in parts. I might throw  the terms feminine or masculine around please don't crucify me, I'm  fairly new to the community and its absolutely not my goal to step on  toes.

A: Some context: I'm a 20 year old, bisexual college student, it's the annoying part of finals week  where i have enough free time to kill time but not enough to make time  for work. I've had a lot of time to think and browse.

B:  One of my main kinks/fetishes is the whole ""dominating sissies"" deal  (I'm aware that sissy doesn't = trans, be patient with me) and recently  I've been given a few reasons to think a little more about that.

C:  Earlier this week I met somebody on a sissy subreddit who got me  thinking a little more in general about me and who/what I'm attracted  to. (Its possible that she browses this page, if you see this don't freak  out I'm not finna confess my undying love or something)

D:  I realized after some...research... that my domination kink extends  beyond sissies to cis males, females and I assume everything in between.  What's left in the sissy fetish after you strip away the domination  part of it are males/trans who present themselves in a feminine way,  physically and emotionally.

E: So now I  know that I'm particularly attracted to Male genitals on feminine  forms, inhabited by ""feminine"" personalities. This doesn't mean that I'm ONLY attracted to what I described. I think of it like this; I like damn  near every kind of ice-cream but my favorite flavor is strawberry. Given  a choice of ice creams I'd probably choose strawberry. Would I ignore  offered Ice-cream just because it isn't strawberry? Probably not. (As I right this it comes off chill, hopefully its not actually like super f\*cked up and I just couldn't tell\]

So  having got all that out of the way, my question to this community, as a  semi-ignorant individual, is this: Is there anything wrong with being  attracted to what I described and is there anything unsavory about  pursuing individuals that fit that description?

If not what am I even describing?

My name is Kristen. A friend and I are starting a semi-custom bra company. We are called, The Hubbub. Our goal is to treat the body as a whole, but each breast as an individual. The current lingerie market does not account for asymmetry in bras. In fact, the original structure that is still used in bras was designed in the 1930s and 1940s. Also, the market does not cater properly to the average woman let alone, cancer survivors who have lost breast tissue after treatment, those in the LGBTQA+ communities that may have different fitting needs, and those with limited mobility in their arms or hands due to mobility or physical impairments (stemming from congenital disorders, amputations, and arthritis).

We are doing market research and would appreciate you filling out our google form.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 14, lots of people told me it would get better. My egg had cracked a little less than a year before and I was so miserable. The environment I was in was absolutely horrible- my parents, along with fighting all the time, would rage at my siblings and me, especially my father. He would throw things at us, scream about the smallest things, and make our lives miserable. I couldn't dress or act in the way I wanted and needed to- I couldn't even have LGBT friends without a lot of shit from my parents- and I felt out of control. Due to my dysphoria, mental health problems, issues at school, and family situation, I turned to self-harm (which I had been doing since the age of 12) and starving myself in order to take control of my life and, in the case of my anorexia, try to lose any feminine parts of my body such as curves and breasts. I was *so* miserable. One day, my mom found something with my preferred name on it and freaked out, and so did my father. I'm not going to get into details about that specific night because it's honestly just too painful to think about, but due to their reaction, I attempted suicide and failed. That was the peak of my mental instability, and all throughout it, people kept telling me it'd get better. My friends consoled me with ""just hold out for a while, this will get better."" My trusted family members told me ""you won't have to deal with this forever."" I didn't believe them. When I was going through all that junk, self-inflicted and inflicted upon me by my situation, I physically could not ever see an end to the misery. When I would try my hardest to keep my sobbing at night quiet so as to not anger my parents, I cursed those who told me that my life would ever be better. How could it ever get better? I was stuck. They just didn't understand. Nobody would ever understand. I felt so... alone.

A year passed from my suicide attempt and we didn't discuss my gender. I started to gain some mental stability, and convinced my parents to let me cut my hair a bit shorter. I started to recover from anorexia, and everything was going pretty ok for me. Then my mom found another red flag that I identified as transgender. I decided with my therapist to come out to her officially and it went... horribly. She told me many horrible things, such as my identity making her want to kill herself and that I could have destroyed our family if she wasn't so strong. She told me she'd never love me as much as she loved my siblings. I fell back into depression, hard. I almost turned to starving myself again. People told me, again, that it would get better. I couldn't believe them- it had gotten arguably worse for me. I just held out as long as I could, trying to survive until college when I could be myself.

After a few months, my aunt caught on to what my mother was doing to me. She said she was horrified and disgusted. She intervened and made my mom take me to a gender therapist, and suddenly a light opened up at the end of the tunnel. It's now been about 9 months since that light opened up, and I'm so thankful I survived. My life has changed so much. My parents got their shit together (when it comes to LGBT stuff- they do still fight and yell and all that but I've become desensitized to it) and my mom especially became one of my greatest allies. I was able to cut my hair how I wanted, I'm going on puberty blockers soon, and I exclusively shop in the men's section of stores. I'm slowly coming out to the people in my life and we are working on a social transition. Dysphoria is still hard, and I face a lot of challenges in my daily life, but for the first time in so many years, I can close my eyes and think about a happy future. I can feel safe in my own home, and among my peers. I still have my share of problems, and am far from my ""happiness goal,"" but now I see that when I cursed the people who told me to hold out, that it would get better, I was just blind- by no fault of my own, of course, but I was blind. All I could see was misery because that's what's easiest for us to see. But even though I gave up hope for my life to ever be tolerable, much less happy, it did get better. I am so excited to get out into the world and live. After coming so close so many times to never getting the chance to live to adulthood, I'm going to take full advantage of the life I've been blessed with. 

Not everyone will be as lucky as I am. I know that. But I came from a situation that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy (there were a lot of things I did not get into in this post due to personal reservations), and now I'm on the road to a happy life. I'm so grateful to everyone who's supported me along the way, but especially for the fact that I never succeeded in giving up. Something or someone always forced me back onto my feet. So, if you're in a time in your life when people are telling you incessantly that it will get better, to just hold on, just step back and put some trust in life. I know how hard it is to see over the wall that's keeping you from happiness, but I promise you from the bottom of my heart that something or someone, whether it's yourself or someone in your life, is going to help boost you up. 

It does get better, I promise. I know, because it got better for me in ways that I could never have imagined.

Thank you for reading my long story, and thank you to the many other individuals in the trans community who have helped guide me and encourage me to find who I am.

I‚Äôve read about something within the trans community, or at least an outside observation; that in order to be classified as transgender, you have to have existing gender dysphoria before you take HRT. 

How I understand ‚Äògender dysphoria‚Äô(keep in mind that I am using information provided by this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/MitqjSYtwrQ ): When humans develop in their mother‚Äôs womb, around 7 weeks your gonads develop based on the existing X or Y chromosomes that is combined from the fertilization of the female ova (X chromosome) and the male sperm (X or Y chromosome). But sexual differentiation occurs differently for the brain than the gonads, as when the nervous system is being built sex-specific hormones and chemicals in the womb can affect the development of the brain, gynogens and androgens specifically (progrsterone, estrogen, testosterone, etc.). In the video they further explain how the developing human brain &amp; nervous system, when exposed to these hormones, result in physically different brain sizes and surface areas (as to reference cisgender brain scans). For the case of transgenderism, the hormones that your body‚Äôs gonads produce‚Äîwhen exposed to the brain through chemical distributions and neurotransmissions, if the hormones are not compatible with the brain‚Äôs receptors then it results in the person suffering from ‚Äògender dysphoria‚Äô.

I will try to explain using a chart:

XY body + XX brain = Transgender female
XX body + XY brain = Transgender male

XX body + XX brain = Cisgender female
XY body + XY brain = Cisgender male

I know that I have not used every detail shown in the video, and that the subjects of non-binary and intersex were not explored in the video. 

I do not expect anybody in this community to agree with my findings, as an outsider looking in; I cannot help but see that people use philosophical discourse instead of biology to better understand how and what being transgender is‚Äîthrough scientific research and understanding.

Been reading recently about the genetic influence on gender dysphoria. I've come across multiple articles and studies (such as the one linked below).


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22146048


Most of these studies find in pairs of identical twins where at least one twin is transgender, only about 30% if the time, both twins are transgender.


Given that identical twins are born with the same DNA, does this prove that gender dysphoria is mainly caused by environmental factors? Or do you still believe it's a biological condition?


If there was a cure for gender dysphoria (outside of transitioning) would you accept it?


I don't mean to offend anyone or anything, I'm just interested in your opinions on the topic, so I apologise if I come off as harsh, transphobic or whatever.

\- i have physical dysphoria around my voice and height over everything else, but also wish i had a flatter chest, even though i'm already very small chested (i'm getting a binder soon)

I've long had a lot of conflicting feelings relating to my gender and have spent a lot of time in the past wearing women's clothes and doing my makeup in my bedroom, fantasising about being able to live as a woman. However, my dysphoria has never been anywhere near as crippling as it is for some, my identity felt fluctuating and basically like I could continue living as a man if only for an easy life. Especially over recent years, I cut my previously long hair, grew a beard and started presented more traditionally masculine, having previously taken a more androgynous if still mostly passing-masculine style. I genuinely started to feel comfortable as a man in this time. It's a shallow marker but I think that with the beard without my hair, I haven't been seeing myself as looking 'pretty' or feminine and so haven't been forced to think to much about my gender identity. I've still thought about it, of course, but for the most part, my feelings could really be summed up as just getting on with it and being happy to accept my lot. I'm in a straight relationship and I had started to settle into the social and sexual dynamic. I haven't dressed as female in around 2 and a half years. However, a couple of nights ago, I had a dream in which I was coming out as female to my friends. In the dream, I was presenting fully feminine, looking amazing and feeling so comfortable. I can't really describe the atmosphere, but I woke up so moved. I know it's just a dream but since waking up that day, I haven't been able to stop thinking about how much I want to be the girl I saw in my dream. As soon as I was alone, I used clothes my girlfriend had left at my house to dress myself up again for the first time in years and all the old feelings came flooding back.

1069,2019-04-28 23:31:18,bihj0z,22,0,"So my best friend in the world is a concert pianist and is playing for a benefit of the transgender community. My views having radically changed over the past few years to the point where I was probably transphobic in retrospect. But I want to learn.

So what changed my view to this poiny is a job I had I developed a friendship with a coworker. She's really pretty and often got hit on a lot. Over time, because of discussions I had, I began to realize she may be trans. And over time, my friendship with her began to be more accepting of the realities of what it truly means up be a trans man or woman. While I never confirmed whether or not that was the case, it doesn't truly matter because it affected my views all the same.

Now, I still have some views that clash with the trans community and I really want to begin asking direct questions to further my understanding. These views may be transphobic so I don't want to hurt anybody by bringing up the painful views but I hope you understand that I genuinely want to, again, understand.

Bare in mind I firmly believe in everybody being happy. And what it means to be trans does not affect me personally so I hold no reservations of changing my mind.

Where I am now: If you are a trans woman, you are a woman. Same with being a trans man. I do not even begin to deny this as your identity is your identity and that's all the proof I need. However, if you were born with the xx or xy chromosome, does that not mean that biologically you will not always a retain a part of you that was born into the sex you do not identify with?

Next, I don't understand how it is not a mental illness. I do not mean this derogatorily. The vtopic I am most passionate about in the world is avocating for mental illness and what ever you are diagnosed with does not mean you are lesser in any way. I, myself, am bipolar. It is a constant struggle and, personally, I currently find the notion that something as life and identity changing as wanting to physically transition your biology to reflect your true gender identity impossible to not consider an abnormal mental condition, not that I find anything wrong with that. At all.

Next when it comes to competitive sports. When trans women competes in, say track, isn't it truly unfair to biologically ciswomen and trans women usually blow them out of the water? I find that wrong in a competitive level. Can somebody explain if they find that opinion wrong?

Next when it comes to my personal sexual preferences. If somebody was to ask me if I would ever consider dating a trans woman I would say no. I'm just not attracted to a non cis woman even if they are beautiful. Same goes for that I would not date a short woman as I am extremely tall. Same goes for other physical attributes. So I'm not singling out trans women.

I hope I did not offend anybody to the point where they find me unreasonable. I do want to better understand the transcommunity, especially before going to this benefit so I have a better understanding if it comes to the point where I am asked my views there. I don't like anybody feeling hurt or ashamed.

That's all I have to ask for now. Thank you in advance for partaking in this discussion with me.",trans,"Going to a trans benifit but I have.

First time here, very long post, sorry ...

&amp;#x200B;

Don't know if I should really post there, still haven't figure it out if I am agender or a trans Afab. Just wanted to share this with you. 

I am shit scared to be honest. Cutting the crap after realising I  was never going to ""succeed"" in being a girl was a huge step but telling myself I might actually be a boy is very frightening. See, I always knew deep inside I wasn't feeling like my body, and I hated it. Once I just put some of my brothers clothes for couple of hours and I took the train with them. It felt weird because it didn't feel weird. I looked like a boy, people didn't look at me like I was some  kind of freak. Having monstrous boobs ( bra cup F, seriously) for a tiny and skinny body I often told myself I couldn't be a boy, because my feminity is so visible people won't  see anything else. But that afternoon proved me wrong, I managed to hide my breasts and I could totally make people see me as a boy if I wanted too

It was 4 years ago and I freaked out.  So I told myself, from now on I would only wear ""feminine"" clothing, wear dresses, make up, high heels... I hoped somehow it would make things easier and ""save "" me from even more problems as I was already coming out as a lesbian and my mom being homophibic it  wasn't easy. 

So for a  years I was in total denial, wearing dresses to prove myself I was a girl, like a gay dude having sex with  so many girls to"" prove himself"" is straight.

&amp;#x200B;

But today I realised, being trans has absolutely nothing to do with clothing or my physical appareance. I don't know why I don't feel like a girl, I mean I have a ""girly"" personality if you stick to stereotypes. I don't know why I don't feel like a girl, I just know I don't. And I am tired to find myself excuses for not being who I am.

&amp;#x200B;

I always loved the name Raphael. Never considered changing name before,  not planing on doing it yet. But whenever I feel down I tell myself ""Come on Raph, you can do this"". And it feels great, in fact it gives me a lot of strenght.

&amp;#x200B;

I am going to take things very slow because I don't want to pressure myself at being the perfect man like I did at being the perfect girl. And I  still don't know if I am trans. Raphael is just a pretty name, a far away dream, not an identity yet.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, I just realised how toxic my narcissistic parents are, and that they never allowed to be myself making me believe I was crazy, evil. If I was lesbian and not ""feminine enough"" it was because I was sick, traumatized by a very violent sexual assault that happened to me when I was a child.

But I have read a lot on the subject and I know gender identity and sexual orientation have nothing to do with trauma. I am the way I am, it wasn't my choice and there is no changing or ""fixing"" me.

&amp;#x200B;

All I want to do is learning how to be myself no matter how scary and out of my comfort zone it might be. 

&amp;#x200B;

EVIDENCE I‚ÄôM ENBY

&gt;General non-sexual fascination with intersex and the concept of androgyny - I naturally associate it with qualities such as freedom, beauty, and perfection, and have done so for a long time

&gt;I feel this kind of kinship/familiarity with content I‚Äôve seen in trans and enby meme subs such as r/traa , r/ennn , and r/LateStageGenderBinary , a kinship I also felt with gay stuff before I discovered I was gay

&gt;I love feminine things like flowers, singing in high notes, skirts, earrings, and dresses

&gt;I hate many aspects of puberty, such as increased musculature, my voice dropping, and pubic hair

&gt;I‚Äôve heard that confusion and constant self-doubt are incredibly common for enby and trans people

&gt;Even though I didn‚Äôt really show any signs of gender nonconformity as a young child, apparently many other people (such as out queen ContraPoints/Natalie Wynn) didn‚Äôt show these qualities either

&gt;I hate gender norms with a bitter passion

EVIDENCE I‚ÄôM NOT ENBY

&gt;I‚Äôve probably never felt dysphoria

&gt;I have this idea that has existed for a long time that people will not be comfortable with me showing effeminate qualities and doing effeminate things

&gt;I didn‚Äôt show much effeminacy when I was younger (at least according to my parents, who seem to be quite accepting of LGBTQ+ stuff)

&gt;I may have felt some kind of dysphoria from being feminine on two occasions - once when I wore a black skirt for a few hours and once when I wore this beautiful ring with a metal rose for a few minutes and pictured myself wearing it in my mind. I felt this kind of uneasiness/distress and I felt a relationship between it and femininity

When I was about 3 years old I decided I absolutely didn't want to be a girl. I refused to wear dresses, skirts or the colour pink. I disliked red because I thought it was too close to pink. By the time I was 5 I had a boys haircut. I have quite a feminine name - Rose - and used to hate how it clearly identified me as a girl.

I happily led my life as a boy up until puberty really, my family were cool with it and so was everyone at school. It was just a case of ""oh that's Rose, she's a boy"".

But then puberty came along. It was confusing. My body did things my friends bodies didn't. I got hips and boobs and couldn't pass convincingly as a boy anymore. By the time I was 16 I was trying to be a ""proper"" girl. I wore makeup, I wore a skirt to school, I made friends with girl groups. Even so I maintained a slight tomboy edge I think, but really this carried on until I was about 18/19. At university I went back to jeans and no makeup, met my boyfriend, and reserved ""girly"" stuff for nights out or special occasions.

Now I'm a few years out the other side of uni and I find that I'm uncomfortable in typically ""feminine"" clothes. I don't feel like myself when I wear a skirt or a dress. I feel like I'm dressing up as a woman. The word woman too - when I get called a woman it feels bizarre and slightly uncomfortable. My sister (27) told me she feels 100% like a woman and this threw me becasue I realised I definitely don't. I feel like an adult for sure, but the word woman just feels wrong.

I'm not intrinsicly uncomfortable being female (she/her doesn't bother me) , but only if I can do it in my way, which isn't really how everyone else sees a female behaving.

Me and my cousin are the same age (born 10 days apart actually!) and we‚Äôve always been very close. 

They did very well in school, pursued and excelled @ dancing, as well as every other hobby they managed to pick up. I, however was the exact opposite. Being the same age &amp; gender, my parents often compared me to them, leading to lifelong feelings of inadequacy. 

I never let these feelings come between me and my cousin however, because for a while they were the only person who really ‚Äògot‚Äô me. I had always been a little bit of a weirdo. 

When I was around 16, I had confided in them that I was bisexual, genderqueer, &amp; would like to go by They/Them pronouns. They said they didn‚Äôt much understand, but they were willing to learn all they could to make me feel as comfortable as possible.  With their support, I was comfortable enough to come out to my friends, (who were all very supportive!) and parents who really just. Disregarded it. They‚Äôve ignored any &amp; all pleas to refer to me by they/them pronouns, their reason being that they were sure I was going to ‚Äúchange my mind anyday now‚Äù (I‚Äôm now 20 &amp; still use they/them.

That hurt me, but I was able to push those feelings aside. I really shouldn‚Äôt have, but I figured since they weren‚Äôt throwing me out or beating me up, I had it pretty good. 

Recently my cousin moved to New York to pursue a career in dancing. Since leaving their rural hometown they‚Äôve become more comfortable in exploring their identity, and have also come out as gender queer earlier this month. They‚Äôve changed their name to MJ, and also go by they/them.

I was very excited when I first heard, but got jealous/upset very quickly with how willing my parents were to adapt to these changes. They refer to them exclusively by their preferred name and pronouns, but always manage to ‚Äòforget‚Äô mine, even with reminders.

What should I do? Why do you think they‚Äôre doing this? How should I bring this up? Every time I feel like I‚Äôm ready to talk to them about it I feel like screaming and crying, because I‚Äôm just so frustrated, but I know that I probably shouldn‚Äôt lmao

I am a PhD student researching experiences of being gender nonconforming in childhood.

&amp;#x200B;

We are looking for **18-24 year old** **UK** volunteers who during childhood:

¬∑ Sometimes or always behaved in some ways that were more typical of children of the ‚Äòopposite‚Äô sex,

¬∑ For example, you might have preferred play activities or clothing more common for children of the ‚Äòopposite‚Äô sex

¬∑ It could have been a passing interest (e.g. six months) or long-lasting.

¬∑ You may have felt able to behave in the way you wanted, or felt that you had to hide it

&amp;#x200B;

This study involves completing a series of screening measures, after which you may be invited to take part in an interview about your experiences

Interviews will last approximately 45-90 minutes.

You will be compensated **¬£20** in cash or vouchers for your time.

Then I had an opportunity to try drag. I'm AFAB, and I've always waxed my upper lip, wore clothes that showed off the curves that I liked, and overall tried to be feminine to feel attractive. But then I got to see myself with hard, defined features and facial hair and I thought I looked HOT. 

I have never been unhappy with my assigned gender. But it's not the whole picture. When I got my first binder I was overjoyed to see a flat chest, despite the fact that I LOVE my boobs.

33,2019-04-06 05:50:23,ba1b8a,55,24,"Hello friends,   


I may seem new here, but over the last few years ive jumped from r/crossdressing to r/lgbt, to so many other related subreddits trying to figure out who I am. And in the last few months, I've figured it out, at least for the most part. (yay?). As I think I relate most closely with gender-non conforming, I've noticed something that bothers me more and more.   


I am AMAB, 24, gender nonconforming, and *straight*.   


*wait.. you're straight and gender nonconforming?*   
*yes.*   
*oh.*   
While I am probably blowing this out of proportions, i guess i need reassurance that people like me exist. That's it. I think some recent thinking and recent events has kind of put me at a boiling point. It's driving me nuts. Like even today, after my bookstore job, I see a book that catches my eye, and its ""Sissy: A Coming to Gender Story"" by Jacob Tobia. Maybe you've heard of it, maybe not. I give it a quick glance and i realize its all about gender conformity--and I'm thinking *yes! finally a book that relates to me!*  
*well.....kind of.*   
Im about 100 pages in, and yes, i should (and will) read the whole thing, but I've found out that the author is gay, and gender nonconforming. **And there's no problem with that.** I'm just a little frustrated because he doesn't really talk about experiences about trans and straight people, like me, and probably other people, and after i realize that, it just gets more frustrating. And don't get me wrong, theres lots of stuff I can relate to, and I enjoy his little stories so far, but it wasn't what i expected and It disappointed me. it just doesn't relate to me, because like many before me, I've been assumed gay by family, friends, strangers for expressing myself femininely. And I don't know if i'll ever be taken seriously by cis, straight women, or really, anyone... I was even nearly sexually harassed last year on a trip outside the country, and that scared me.   


TLDR kind of:   
So again, i guess what I'm asking is one, that if you gender-nonconforming, straight AMAB friends could come out and just say HI, so I know im not alone, and maybe even give me a piece of advice on what to do about being assumed gay, or how to do dating, or hell, just life in general. I need some reassurance.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm afab and genderqueer/nonbinary.  I'm very unhappy right now because no matter what I do I get read as female.

I'm trying to look up information online, to learn more before I try to talk to a doctor again, but I keep panicking because I hear some people say that the changes from non binary transition are never permanent, so I feel like I'll never be seen as how I am, and I see other people who are so happy with how they look, and they look amazing, and I know I'll never be like them.",genderqueer,Not sure what to do,1554862805.0,"{'created_utc': 1554837605, 'id': 'bbc3eh', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 13, 'selftext': 'Sorry that this is a bit of a rant.

I recently started seeing this amazing girl who has been very supportive  of the fact that I am in the midst of exploring my genderqueerness.  After becoming intimate she asked me what sorts of things I need in the  bedroom in order to feel affirmed. I am AFAB but have always felt more  aligned with a¬† masculine identity. I experience dysphoria regarding my  chest but not always with my genitals. There are certain things I know  about how I want to be intimate with another person: i.e. touch my chest  at the top so it feels like a flat chest. But I'm still trying to work  out what other things would feel right.

I completely understand that everyone has a different experience, and  different interests sexually, but I've been really curious to learn more  about what other folks do to feel affirmed while having sex. I'm just  hoping for a little inspiration from others that will help me navigate  this for myself.

I often wonder‚Äî are there actually a much larger % of people who are trans, or non-binary / binary nonconforming, gender-fluid, or something similar - but the social construct is so prevalent and those maintaining it work SO HARD to convince everyone they must be one or the other, that a lot of these people just kind of never think twice? 

They are comfortable enough, they‚Äôve been assigned certain pronouns all their life so it‚Äôs just familiar at this point and if really pressed they‚Äôd be fine with any pronouns anyway, so it isn‚Äôt enough to really get them thinking or wondering more about it and digging deeper into their own gender and identity.

But it feels... not fake, but I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs not valid. That I‚Äôm misinterpreting my own privileges for possible gender fruity... (i.e. the reason it doesn‚Äôt bother me if someone calls me ‚Äúshe‚Äù - I‚Äôm always going to be protected by patriarchy as a man who mostly fits the binary expectation). Other times I really do feel disconnected from one gender, especially a binary gender ID. 

There have been times where I‚Äôve seriously wondered if I am trans but I‚Äôve avoided it all my life until now because of all that binary sex/gender essentialist conditioning and it was never even a possibility I knew to consider until now, and now it feels way too late to transition anyway üòÖ

And then other times I‚Äôm like, no I‚Äôm a man ‚ÄîYes I wear all my clothes from the ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù section because it‚Äôs familiar and comfortable, but outside a handful of things, I really I don‚Äôt have a lot interest in or identity connection to most ‚Äútraditional‚Äù expressions of manhood or masculinity.

And then I realize... all that is made up and has nothing to do with gender or identity either and I could act like the most stereotypically masculine male man to ever Be A Man ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and still be non binary or trans or anything!

123,2019-04-19 13:08:32,beywfa,0,1,"This might get long!

I‚Äôm afab, grew up in a very conservative fundamentalist environment, and went through an early and very fast puberty that gave me a very afab figure. I‚Äôve always been kind of pigeonholed into this hyper-femme category, especially since I‚Äôm the only one in my large family who likes makeup, nail polish, and fashion. For a long time I wore rockabilly-style clothes, because my body is pretty hourglassy and I thought that was what I was ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to wear.  I didn‚Äôt come out as bi for a long time because I was pigeonholed as ‚Äúboy-crazy‚Äù (I‚Äôm really more like hypersexual, I just didn‚Äôt talk about the girls/gq folk!)

At 16 I cut my hair really short and absolutely loved it. I started experimenting with dressing a little more masc. I shied away from being too masc because I was still concerned with being ‚Äúsexy‚Äù and really gauged that by male attention. Around that time I had my first (very closeted, very fucked up) girlfriend. (I went to a Christian highschool so all queer relationships were closeted, but this girl wouldn‚Äôt even admit we were together to me, even though we met up for secret cuddles and she got jealous if I talked to other people and she came to me for all her emotional support and we held hands constantly)

Anyway, time passed and I just kind of sucked it up, I guess. Got married to an abusive guy who really pushed me to be more classically femme. Had my first baby and discovered that pregnancy and breastfeeding gave me HELLA dysphoria. I had a breast reduction after my first kid weaned, but the surgeon refused to go as small as I wanted because she was worried about maintaining a feminine proportion :/. Cut all my hair off and wore really masc haircuts for a while, pissing off my ex‚Äôs family.

I‚Äôm in a much better place now. I left my abusive ex, am dating someone who‚Äôs genderqueer and bi and incredibly supportive, and just had my second baby. 

A few years ago my older child came out as a trans girl. In supporting her, I‚Äôm learning more and more about trans people, and I follow a lot of trans twitter. Recently two things really struck me: 1) a post that said ‚Äúif your response to people transitioning is jealousy, you‚Äôre not cis‚Äù and 2) an article that said to pay attention to your gender euphoria, not dysphoria 

I am jealous of every transmasc person  I know. I have wanted a binder since I grew breasts (my dysphoria is mostly focused on my tits). Every photo I like of myself, since highschool, is a photo where I look masculine. I used to look at one of those photos and imagine a whole life where I was a boy.  I haven't used my feminine birth name in years- I go by a neutral nickname. 

But ""man"" doesn't really feel like the right identity to me. I can't tell if that's just internalized transphobia, really. I like my kids calling me ""mom"" and I still love dresses and I'm currently excited about growing out my hair, but I've been realizing that my predominant identity is more masculine and the femme stuff always feels kind of like an act. Like ""oooh I can trick these folks into thinking I'm a real girl!"" Right now, because my abusive ex wouldn't let me buy clothes and I've been broke since I left him, I just wear whatever clothes fit me and are cheap or free.

Tbh the identity that feels closest for me is slightly masc of centre. But being a fat, curvy mom with very big boobs, I feel kind of like I'm fucked. I'm also breastfeeding currently so I can't wear a binder. 

I can't afford therapy right now but I'm starting a new job soon and looking forward to finding a knowledgeable therapist to work with. In the meantime I'm just kind of flailing. I don't like wearing button downs or knit hats and I'm growing my hair out and tbh I don't give a fuck about pronouns for myself, but I definitely know I'm not a woman.

163,2019-04-23 15:12:12,bghinx,0,1,"Hi there /r/genderqueer. My name is Wiggums, and I am figuring all of this out. Wanted to get my thoughts and feelings out there. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am MAAB, and was raised strict Roman Catholic. I fully left the church at about 16 (but I started getting disillusioned around 11), the biggest contributing factor was when my friend Mike came out to me as gay. I became pretty incensed, as he was one of the kindest, most selfless people that I had ever met, and because of the fact of how he was born, my family/religion would say that he wasn't as worthy of love as them, and that he was less than. I made an active choice at that time to be an Ally at that time, even though I didn't know what an Ally was (or indeed, if that was even a term at that time). I had dozens (if not hundreds) of heated discussions/arguments trying to convince my family/friends that LGBT (even before I knew what LGBT was) people were valid, and that they shouldn't have to hide, go against their nature and just live in a straight relationship because the Bible said that they weren't valid, and trying to convince them that it wasn't a choice...needless to say, it was like beating my head against a wall.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to present day (a little less than 2 decades later). My long term GF and I broke up, in August of last year, and once I got to a point where I was able to start dating again, I became willing to start experimenting with my sexuality (I have been questioning since I was about 14, but because of my upbringing and my family, I denied it and wouldn't allow it to be a possibility)...and realized that I am not straight. No idea what I am, not putting a label on it, because 1) I don't want to limit myself, and 2) advice from multiple people.

&amp;#x200B;

Now you may be wondering what that has to do with my gender, but it was an integral part of this whole story. Because of my willingness to allow myself to entertain the possibility that I was not a straight male, it opened up a floodgate, if you will. I then started talking to a coworker, we will call her K for the purposes of this story. K had shared with me that she was genderfluid and we had some conversations about what that meant, and how she felt and such. Some of the things that she said made sense and were familiar to me. I never fully felt like a man, but I knew that I wasn't Transgender, and I didn't realize that gender was like sexuality that it wasn't just M/F/T and that's it (even though I have a lot of NB and Trans friends and confidants...let's chalk it up to, I am oblivious and move on), so I never realized that it wasn't normal (if that exists...) for me to feel the way I did.

&amp;#x200B;

To get into how my gender presents, I basically feel like I am somewhere in between Male and Female most of the time, kind of in a gray area, if you will. There are swings at times to either more masculine or more feminine, with no rhyme or reason as to when, which, or for how long they will be for, or there will be elements of both at the same time. I don't have dysphoria most of the time (obviously not when I feel more masculine, because I am MAAB) but when I am feeling more feminine, there is some. It is not to the extreme, it is more like there is something wrong, and I just can't put my finger on it. Something is just off.

&amp;#x200B;

So, last night, I got my first bras and panties, which was anxiety provoking (I was standing in the aisle trying to figure out what sizes/colors/styles to get, and wondering what people are thinking of me when they walk by (I am confident in who I am, but still have fear about what people think). But, once I got home and put them on, I just felt so comfortable and at peace. When I have a bra on, it just feels so right, like I can actually breathe, and like I can fully be me.

I fully left the church at about 16 (but I started getting disillusioned around 11), the biggest contributing factor was when my friend Mike came out to me as gay.

I made an active choice at that time to be an Ally at that time, even though I didn't know what an Ally was (or indeed, if that was even a term at that time). I had dozens (if not hundreds) of heated discussions/arguments trying to convince my family/friends that LGBT (even before I knew what LGBT was) people were valid, and that they shouldn't have to hide, go against their nature and just live in a straight relationship because the Bible said that they weren't valid, and trying to convince them that it wasn't a choice...needless to say, it was like beating my head against a wall.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFast forward to present day (a little less than 2 decades later).

As we‚Äôve gotten to know each other better she‚Äôs opened up to me about questioning her gender identity slowly over the past year. It seems to be growing more intense lately, she‚Äôs a very private person (has a really rough childhood and has trouble opening up) and doesn‚Äôt like to ‚Äúburden‚Äù me with her problems, which I understand because I am similar about sensitive personal details. So whenever we talk seriously about her identity it‚Äôs pretty much always when she‚Äôs intoxicated. To clarify I NEVER push her to talk about something she doesn‚Äôt want to, especially when she‚Äôs under the influence, however occasionally after we go to bed and are alone when she‚Äôs drunk she talks more openly about her identity struggles. I don‚Äôt ask her questions I just lay there and hold her while she vents usually, and affirm that I love her no matter what. She‚Äôs always so worried that being anything other than female would be a disappointment to me, despite me consistently reminding her that I‚Äôm bisexual and I‚Äôll love her no matter what gender. 

I was wondering if there was anything I could do as her partner to make her feel more comfortable, I‚Äôve started trying to refer to her using more gender neutral pronouns and even changed her name in my phone to a gender neutral pet-name. However, while she‚Äôs postulated about maybe being nonbianary or trans (since she‚Äôs still trying to work that out) she hasn‚Äôt told me to change her pronouns. Is referring to her in more gender neutral terms overstepping? Is there anything else I should do as her partner to make her feel more comfortable and free to help find her gender identity?

Hi, I'm 33 and AMAB, and for a long time I've been okay with that.

Tl;dr I'm confused, and just want to be supportive, but it's hard when you don't know who you are.

A few weeks ago, my spouse and I were doing a lot of soul searching. And we came to some conclusions together. They've finally accepted that they are trans, and I'm so happy for them. They seem so much happier when we're home and they can be who they were meant to be. 

But I also realized that I am not what I was born as either, but I'm not as confident in myself. I've always fought with depression, anxiety, and a slew of other problems, so I've felt like I lost my true self a long time ago, and this has just kind of. Made things worse? I feel like I'm living even more of a lie than before any time i have to go out. And when I'm at work. I've always hated my body, with the exception of my breasts, and while I dont like some things about them I've always taken pride in the way they look in the right bras. But now they just make me uncomfortable. 

I know binders are a thing, I've wanted one since I was a teen (I'm 25 now) but I've never had the money, and I'm so paranoid about getting the wrong size. And i want to get a packer as well.

My spouse has been super supportive, and we've been helping each other out as much as possible, trading clothes and such, but I feel like a child playing dress up. They say I look good but all I can see is someone dressed in clothes that don't fit, trying to be something they're not, while feeling jealous that they look like the girl I've always wanted to be, while still being the kind of guy I want to be.

Meanwhile, we've been using preferred pronouns, and while I like being called he, sometimes it irritates me, but I dont want to be called she either. And they keep talking about things like I want to fully transition with them. Things like when we go on hormones. And I dont know what I want yet.

But that's the biggest problem I think. Is that I dont know what I want, besides to not be a girl? But I still like the idea of doing my makeup (not that I can do makeup), and putting on a pretty dress, and going out into the world. And I want to grow my hair out long again, because I used to have hair down to my waist, but it gets a certain length and I cant stand it any more and cut it again. 

And my brain keeps saying I'm being stupid, and just copying my spouse and I'll get over it, but I've had these feelings since I was a teenager, and I know they aren't invalid and I won't just get over it.

35,2019-04-05 23:25:49,b9y5wb,11,15,"Hi there!

(This is going to be a long one, so I'm warning you now.)

I'd just like to say I'm new to the sub but I've identified as genderfluid for a few years now. While I still technically view myself as genderfluid, I've gotten some really rude and upsetting comments from a few friends and associates in the genderfluid and trans* spectrums that really have me second thinking myself and my ""official"" label.

(I've gotten comments from my family too because they don't believe gender can be fluid.)

At first, I ignored the comments because I knew who I was. But now, after a few years of constantly dealing with them it's really starting to affect my mental health.

(I do see a counselor, but it's not as helpful as talking to other people who are within my spectrum.)

A little backstory before moving on:

I'm a 25 yo pansexual biological female. I've never seen colours, makeup or clothes as things that should be associated with gender and I've always been a openminxed. I came out as bi my freshman year of high school &amp; then I realized I was actually pan at 17. A lot of my friends between now &amp; then were part of the LGBT+ community, even my mother who was bisexual at the time.

I never really had a major issue when I realized I was genderfluid. I just knew that some days I felt very uncomfortable being called a girl. It confused me at first, but after talking to a friend of mine that was non-binary I figured out what was going on with me. So I spent a few months soul searching, trying to figure out how exactly it was that I felt when it finally hit me that I was fluid. Most of the time I felt in between, but I had days when I felt particularly masculine or female.

My main pronouns are She/Her &amp; Them/They.
On my masculine days I prefer He/Him or Them/They.

Back to the problem at hand:

Sometimes on my masculine days I would wear skirts, 'girly' colours, and even low cut tops. Hell, sometimes wore makeup as well. I never really saw a problem with it. I was comfortable to me and it didn't make me feel uneasy.

However, it upset my friends. I would get pulled to the side and asked why I was wearing what I had on, or they would tell me I was confused and it was confusing them. A few former friends even accused me of faking being genderfluid for attention.

In the beginning I would ignore it and tell them to believe what they wanted to believe but as time went on I found myself trying to explain to people why I was okay dressing how I did when I was having a ""HE"" day.

On top of that my mother and sister told me I was confused because there were only two genders: Male and Female. Because I had a vagina, I wasn't allowed to be fluid to them. The only way they would call me a he is if I was trans*.

It's gotten to the point that when I do have masculine days, I suppress that part of me or I retreat into the comfort of my own room and ignore everybody.

It makes me so uncomfortable that I can't be myself without someone judging me. Strangers I don't mind but when it's my friends and family, it hurts.

And now here I am second guessing myself, wondering if I can even consider myself genderfluid. There's just so much going on in my mind and it's raising my anxiety through the roof.

TL;DR

My family isn't supportive of my gender fluidity and my friends think I'm faking it because I wear 'girly' things on my masculine days.

But I guess my post is a bit of a debbie downer...

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially I'm struggling with this gender dysphoria that I've been feeling recently. I basically met an awesomely supportive friend, and I've essentially told them I'm bigender/genderfluid. The problem being, I feel strange telling this to her, because of how often I've just presented myself as cishet male. I'm not, I know I'm not, but I've just done it out of convenience and for people I don't know well enough or who aren't open enough to people being benderfluid/genderqueer. And this brought back a flood of feelings that I usually suppress in some morning when I wake up. Feelings of ""hey, I feel cute today, I want to express that cuteness with a dress or a cute top and a skirt or something."" But I never do, or I keep it at home. Like, I feel bad that I call myself genderfluid when I haven't really expressed that in non-LGBT exclusive places. I'm sure I have opportunities to express my femininity in public every day, like just spending the day at the coffee shop studying, but I never do. I don't have the courage, because I just hate the feeling of being judged, stared at, nitpicked for not being as pretty or looking as feminine as the transwomen that are visible nowadays. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I want to with her. I want to go and study, presenting female, not caring what other people think. But I don't think I can. It's like I can't. I can't ignore the things that bother me about my body. My arms, my jaw, my hips, my rear. It's just all proportioned wrong and essentially I wish I had the power to shapeshift. But I can't see myself waking up tomorrow and seriously saying eff the world and do what I want to do. I can't see myself putting on the mask of makeup I hide behind and think it perfect enough to see the light of day.

So the wind where I live was super bad, my initial outfit was simply just boots, fem skinny jeans, a tank, cardigan, and leather jacket.

Bodyswap fiction, shapeshifting fiction...I've always found stuff like this erotic, but beyond the sexual component, I think it's generally fascinating.

In addition to mere fascination with gender ""swapping"" in fiction, sometimes I would crossdress in private when I was between 12-15 years old (not sure how many times, but it was definitely most prominent during this range). Since then, I've done it maybe 5 times or less. Since I turned 25, I've done it 0 times. In a nutshell, I'd find women undergarments in the house and wear them in private, and get a thrill from it.

As for what I do now, I still watch and even create fiction that involves male to female transformations, whether that be bodyswaps, or shapeshifts etc. Sometimes, that's done from my first-person POV; for example, me becoming a female celebrity and how I would react and express myself in that situation.

So, I don't know where this leaves me. I've read about gender dysphoria and the common feelings associated with it, and I click some but not all of the boxes. For example, I feel there's a feminine side of myself I don't get to express, and instead have to live as a typical, bland guy everyday. That said, I don't have any animosity towards having a penis. The biggest thing that I feel, viscerally, is the inability to express a part of myself.

I also worry about this sort of non-binary behavior being accepted by cis-women in a dating context. But I suppose that shouldn't even be a concern, since if they can't accept who I fully am, then I shouldn't date them. Also, I shouldn't assume that ""expressing a feminine side"" entails huge swaths of makeup or significant crossdressing...I suppose it can be more subtle.

108,2019-04-17 14:43:06,be8m0z,3,3,"So the past few years have been pretty rocky for me. I am only now starting to come out on the other side of depression, anxiety, OCD etc, and I have found that I just don't know who I am. I went to pride every year since 2012 (apart from last year, because I wasn't proud of anything about myself) and I have just turned 20. I remember growing up that I wore a bikini on holiday without the top and liked it when people mistook me for a boy. I was a tomboy for most of my life, only getting real female friends and dressing/acting more feminine a couple of years ago. I'm kind of scared of what is going on right now, but I am planning on getting my hair cut short in a gender neutral style. After a bit of internet digging I think that I identify closest with being genderqueer/genderfluid but every time I read anything about it online I am filled with fear and anxiety as to how to even start identifying like that! I am at uni and the people I know there all know me as a cis female but how do I go about establishing a less binary identity? I'm pretty nervous about just straight up correcting people if they use she/her because I think I would prefer them/they. I'm also kinda scared that these feelings are invalid due to the circumstances, but maybe I've been like this all along?

I am only now starting to come out on the other side of depression, anxiety, OCD etc, and I have found that I just don't know who I am. I went to pride every year since 2012 (apart from last year, because I wasn't proud of anything about myself) and I have just turned 20. I remember growing up that I wore a bikini on holiday without the top and liked it when people mistook me for a boy. I was a tomboy for most of my life, only getting real female friends and dressing/acting more feminine a couple of years ago. I'm kind of scared of what is going on right now, but I am planning on getting my hair cut short in a gender neutral style. After a bit of internet digging I think that I identify closest with being genderqueer/genderfluid but every time I read anything about it online I am filled with fear and anxiety as to how to even start identifying like that! I am at uni and the people I know there all know me as a cis female but how do I go about establishing a less binary identity? I'm pretty nervous about just straight up correcting people if they use she/her because I think I would prefer them/they. I'm also kinda scared that these feelings are invalid due to the circumstances, but maybe I've been like this all along?

So, I'm trying to come up with an alternate username, but I also think it could be an actual alternate/additional name. I don't see it necessarily as changing my name - my given name will always be one of my names - but adding names. 

But I keep overthinking it. 

One idea that came to me is that I have always really liked cat tails. When I was little my mom would pick one for me, and I'd play with it. I loved the texture  of the seeds all tightly packed together. 

So I looked up the latin word for cattail and it's Typha (pronounced TIE-phuh, more or less). I thought that might be cool as a name, but the 'a' ending makes it sound more feminine than I'm going for. Maybe as a middle name instead. Then I doubt myself because I think, why latin? Isn't that kind of Eurocentric? But I'm not sure what other language I would use. 

I kinda want to ask my mom what she would have named me if I was a boy, even though I'm not trans masc, but as a jumping off point. I like gender neutral names like Jamie. And any name can be gender neutral, but it all depends on perceptions. 

I'd like to have a name that  says something about my personality, kinda like in Tailchaser's Song (link below). But my personality changes so much that that is hard to pin down.
