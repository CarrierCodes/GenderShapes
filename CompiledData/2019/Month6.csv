&amp;#x200B;

I recently made a post about hearing my own name, and that was online being introduced to 1 new person with my name. Tonight, I was invited to go to a cafe on a college campus to see a friend of a friend do a comedy routine. I went along and expected to not really interact with people, I have pretty bad social anxiety and a hard time doing normal conversations so it was nice to think I wouldn't talk to anyone buy my friend and her boyfriend. I was wrong. It was a small establishment so though there weren't many people, it felt pretty packed. I was introduced to the person doing the comedy routine, fellow trans person which was nice to know. We went and watched in a side room and then went back to the cafe area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is when several people began coming up to talk to my friend who invited me, people she had recently met while in hospital (including the comedian). I was sort of keeping to the side and observing rather than interacting. I was introduced but then not really talked to. But then instead of one large group it separated and I ended up talking to this one guy and girl. They would get my attention by calling me Salem and it made me stupid happy. Like hearing your name isn't something that should make you this stupidly happy. I was able to crack jokes to make them laugh and kinda make myself comfortable with them. Then we moved outside since it was hot and the whole group came together and I talked to everyone. People continually getting my attention. ""'Salem!' 'Salem you and her need to come over some time.' 'You're a true horror fan then, Salem.'"" It's like my smile couldn't compete with my heart racing.

....”””””Happy Pride month everyone! I don’t normally go out of my way to post about pride. I’ve had so many people ask me why someone should have LGBT pride? When straight people don’t have pride to be straight. Why should there be gay parades and not straight parades?   

Peter Boghossian says this better than I can so I’ll quote him here, “LGBT pride does not mean being proud of having been born lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans.

It means being proud of having survived.

LGBT pride flag
It means being proud of living in a homophobic, biphobic, transphobic society — a society that commonly treats us with contempt at best and violent hatred at worst — and still getting on with our lives. It means being proud of flourishing, in a society that commonly thinks we’re broken. It means being proud of being happy, in a society that commonly thinks we should be miserable. It means being proud of being good and compassionate, in a society that commonly thinks we’re wicked. It means being proud of fighting for our rights and the rights of others like us, in a society that commonly thinks we should lie down and let ourselves get walked on — or that thinks we should be grateful for crumbs and not ask for more. It means being proud of retaining our dignity, in a society that commonly treats us as laughing-stocks. It means being proud of loving our sexuality and our bodies, in a society that commonly thinks our sexuality and our bodies are disgusting. It means being proud of staying alive, in a society that commonly beats us down and wants us dead.
It is not easy to do any of this. Despite the many advances LGBT people have made over the decades, we still live in a society that commonly thinks we should be ashamed simply for existing. It is incredibly difficult to listen to people denigrate us, taunt us, humiliate us, bully us, shame us, from the earliest days of our childhood until the day we die — and still flourish, still be happy, still be compassionate, still fight for our rights, still retain our dignity, still love our bodies and our sexualities and our selves, still survive.

It is not easy to do any of this. It takes work.

When LGBT people talk about LGBT pride, when we attend LGBT Pride celebrations, when we say we’re proud to be gay or lesbian or bisexual or trans, this is what we’re talking about. It is a hugely important aspect of LGBT history and culture. And when people mock it and denigrate it in public, many of us take it rather personally. Experience has taught us that when people treat the concept of LGBT pride with hostility and contempt, they tend to treat us — our history, our culture, our struggles for equality and rights — with hostility and contempt.”

I’ve struggled my whole life to be completely honest with who I am to everyone I love. In fear they wouldn’t love me in whole. That they would think a part of me was disgusting. This post is to tell anyone who takes the time to read this every part of about me, I’ve shared with you over the years was genuine. I wasn’t always proud of who I am. But as I’m growing up and being reminded everyday I am loved and accepted I am growing to have pride. If you knew me as the little girl in 90s frilly dresses, that was me! If you knew me when all I wanted to do was wear boxers, Steelers shirts, swim and watch football, also me. Through the awkward teenage years when I dated men, here’s the truth, also me! I was attracted to a couple guys. When I was a young adult and got pressured from my family to say if I was straight or gay. I said gay. Because it was the part I wanted them to accept the most. That is also me. I identify as gay, as queer, and I still find men attractive. Me in my twenties that didn’t leave the house with a low cut shirt and tons of makeup because I wanted everyone to think I was pretty. Me, when I shaved my head, bleached it blonde, tried every color I could get my hands on. Also me! It wasn’t a melt down or phase. It was me being myself without worrying what anyone would think for once. If you’ve seen the rare pictures of me questioning if people would still find me attractive if I cut all my hair off then you seen a side of me that is vulnerable. I’ve wanted to since I was a kid. Maybe someday I’ll get the guts. This year I’m taking a big step and being proud of who God has made me and is making me. I always felt God wanted to rename me. After years of questioning and not wanting to hurt anyone’s feelings I’ve embraced my name as Ace. This year I will change my gender to x on my driver license. Because it’s just another aspect of myself I need to learn to be proud of. This doesn’t mean you don’t know me if this is new information. In fact it means you now, know me more. I’m happy to share my pride with everyone now because it means I survived all the self doubt. I found out through it all my family loves me no matter who I date, what I wear, or eat (the pescatarian Year’s where hard on them lol), or what I go by. And now I’ve found a wife that makes me feel comfortable to share who I am with her and she makes me feel so loved and happy. So my goal this month is to share my pride with everyone. So they know they can be prideful of their struggles and fears too. That they too will be loved and accepted if they have the courage to be genuine.”””””

I’ve had so many people ask me why someone should have LGBT pride? When straight people don’t have pride to be straight. Why should there be gay parades and not straight parades?   \n\nPeter Boghossian says this better than I can so I’ll quote him here, “LGBT pride does not mean being proud of having been born lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans.\n\nIt means being proud of having survived.\n\nLGBT pride flag\nIt means being proud of living in a homophobic, biphobic, transphobic society — a society that commonly treats us with contempt at best and violent hatred at worst — and still getting on with our lives. It means being proud of flourishing, in a society that commonly thinks we’re broken. It means being proud of being happy, in a society that commonly thinks we should be miserable. It means being proud of being good and compassionate, in a society that commonly thinks we’re wicked. It means being proud of fighting for our rights and the rights of others like us, in a society that commonly thinks we should lie down and let ourselves get walked on — or that thinks we should be grateful for crumbs and not ask for more. It means being proud of retaining our dignity, in a society that commonly treats us as laughing-stocks. It means being proud of loving our sexuality and our bodies, in a society that commonly thinks our sexuality and our bodies are disgusting. It means being proud of staying alive, in a society that commonly beats us down and wants us dead.\nIt is not easy to do any of this. Despite the many advances LGBT people have made over the decades, we still live in a society that commonly thinks we should be ashamed simply for existing. It is incredibly difficult to listen to people denigrate us, taunt us, humiliate us, bully us, shame us, from the earliest days of our childhood until the day we die — and still flourish, still be happy, still be compassionate, still fight for our rights, still retain our dignity, still love our bodies and our sexualities and our selves, still survive.\n\nIt is not easy to do any of this. It takes work.\n\nWhen LGBT people talk about LGBT pride, when we attend LGBT Pride celebrations, when we say we’re proud to be gay or lesbian or bisexual or trans, this is what we’re talking about.

77,2019-06-02 15:46:10,bvyp7l,6,8,"After having sessions with my gender therapist, talking with close friends, browsing this and related subreddits, and generally mulling things over, I'm now pretty sure that I do fit somewhere under the umbrella of gender non-conformity.

But because I don't know exactly where I fit, and because there are so many different terms, I don't know how I would go about ""coming out"" if I were to do so.  And that then made me think about whether it is, in my position, even necessary to ""come out"" as any particular label.  I would much prefer to say that I'm just being me, and that I'm expressing myself in a way that makes me feel comfortable, attractive, confident, and like my true self.

Non-binary is a relatively new term, and there are still debates about what it entails, and/or if it exists, and if I tell someone that I'm non-binary, they might not understand what it means, or even after an explanation, they might still not get it, or they may see it as a fad or phase of some sort.  I don't really want to have to make these kinds of explanations all the time - I'd rather just be myself.  

With this in mind, I've decided that I want to slowly embrace a more androgynous/ambiguous appearance.  I know that having an androgynous appearance isn't necessary to be non-binary, but for my own personal aesthetic, having that kind of appearance would give me more confidence and help me be open about it.  For the record, I'm not out to family, work, or anyone except a very specific circle of friends, and it's been that way for years.  

My most recent step was getting a new haircut.  I've always had a typical short haircut (for a cisgender male, since I'm AMAB), but very recently went to see a new hair specialist who is non-binary (and uses he/him pronouns).  I told him about my situation and he gave me a haircut that makes me feel much more androgynous when looking in the mirror.  At the same time, I can also brush it in a certain way so that the haircut still looks more masculine and less androgynous, which is useful for situations like work where I don't (yet) want to be really overt about it.

As time passes, and I continue growing/styling my hair in a new way, and make some changes to my wardrobe, though, I suspect that people will have noticed that I've developed a new style.  It's hard to say whether it will lead to any questions - my thoughts are that at work at least, people tend to mind their own business, and since there are a few openly trans/non-binary people at my workplace, I'm pretty sure that a subtle change in style on my part would be any sort of an ""issue"".

My pronouns are they/them but people still use he/him at work because they simply don't know, since I haven't given any overt signals about it.  I don't want to make a big announcement about it or anything and force people to act differently around me, though if anyone does end up asking me my pronouns due to a style change, I'll likely say something like ""they/them, but here (at work), it's still fine to use he/him for me"".

-I'm overweight so trying to avoid looking fatter.
-I'm hoping for something pretty masculine but perhaps a touch androgenous.
-I don't like the fades when it's shaved to the skin (I'm also thinking that would be extra high maintence.)
-I don't like heavily slicked looks
-I don't mind wavy or straugyt styles as it's mostly my ends that curl so I suspect near my roots with be straight

In comparison, the more masculine mannerisms I have require(d) practice and near constant thought but make me feel more secure. 

For example, I have spent the past two years practicing how to walk in the _least_ swishy, most natural way possible, and the past 8 months practicing my most natural chest voice on the true but somewhat forced premise of voice acting (this was easy to justify to both myself and my mother, as I often read out my fiction stories and most of my characters are boys).

159,2019-06-04 04:23:40,bwkitt,3,4,"To try and make this post short, since I have a tendency to ramble:  


I'm an AFAB nonbinary person. My gender identity has fluctuated a lot over the years since coming out at around 14 (and realizing I'm trans around 13). I'm 19 now and have been on T for 3 years. I would not in any way describe myself currently as transmasculine. Y'all know how funky gender is. I put myself around bigender/genderfluid (sometimes two-spirit since I have indigenous Mexican ancestry but I'm very pale and white passing so I tend to keep that more personal).

&amp;#x200B;

I came out as a trans guy when I was about 14/15, partially because at the time my parents were not taking NB identities seriously, partially because I just hated being called she. My legal name has been changed as well as my legal sex. I started T as a trans dude and over time settled into an NB identity but still wanted to stay on T, as being gendered as a cis woman was dreadful for me, and I thought that being gendered as a cis dude wasn't perfect, but would be fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Well.. 3 years later, and I was totally wrong. The dysphoria is so different, but it's there. Oh boy it's there. It's weird too, because getting called ""she"" can still be upsetting.. and sometimes... it's not anymore. I think it's partially because my goal has always been to be androgynous and difficult to gender, so now getting she'd is almost funny to me, since most people just meet me and assume dude at this point (though this depends on what I'm wearing)...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways. I've been on T for 3 years but for a good 2 and a half of those I was awful about remembering my shot and was basically low dosing? Very consistently skipping a dose (supposed to do weekly). I was slightly bothered about how some changes were not happening much. Then I moved out, and have been consistently not missing my dose for about 3 months and... oh boy.

Mostly, it's the facial hair. Having a peach fuzz mustache and sometimes some soft neck hair that I had to shave every month at most? Awesome, actually. Now, just after 3 months.. Seriously starting to get neck hair, chin hair, lip hair.. much coarser, darker, and growing way faster? Nope. I hate it. I'm despising it. I feel ill thinking about it.

I don't regret going on T. But suddenly I'm wanting to quit cold turkey. I'm feeling paranoid about my hair thinning (I don't think it is but who knows!). I'm realizing this facial hair is PERMANENT and will probably only get thicker as time goes on. I see my face getting rough and... I guess I didn't realize beforehand that the low dosage I was accidentally giving myself was a magical sweet spot. And yeah on my occasional masc days, or days where I'd get she'd a LOT, I'd lament at how slow changes were happening.. But... I don't know. 

If this has done anything positive, it's made me feel much more valid in my nonbinary identity? Just ""she"" or ""he"" (or ""woman"" or ""man"") both make me almost equally uncomfortable these days. Different, but both bad. I just want to be me. A mix of the two is fine, ""they"" is preferred... I don't know. I thought I would be fine enough with being a dude. But it's not good either.

As per my title... AMAB enbies and transfem folks.. tips? I really love a boyish, young, androgynous look. Butchy, almost, but not in clothing style. I have no clue how to do makeup (and right now can't afford it lol) but I'm considering it. But I'm autistic and stuff like lots of foundation etc makes my skin crawl.. so.. I don't know. How expensive is laser? Should I just suck it up and shave once a week?

Has anybody else gone through anything like this? I'm not detransitioning.. I just.. T made me really happy for a long time and now suddenly it isn't anymore. I'll be seeing my doctor soon and I am planning on asking her if I can safely just move back to a shot every two weeks. Sorry for this rant. I thought for a while I had my gender perfectly figured out.. But now that I'm consistently seen as a ""man"" in day to day life, I feel myself wishing I looked more like a girl again.

GoawayThrowaway1992

In reading, I really like how supportive and wholesome this group is! Very loving vibes on this subreddit.   


But Unfortunately, I didn't feel my question has been asked before. (that I could find)

I am cis hetero male and have always been attracted to very androgynous women. Recently I have had two NB partners and they are both super lovley, wonderful and sexy humans. Although I sometimes have trouble aligning my sexuality with their identity. I really don't want to stress anyone out on here I just want to be candid.   


I am attracted to the female body and also a female energy. When I am physically intimate with my NB partners, my body wants to engage with them because of their fem physiology and fem energy.  Their androgynous look is definitely very sexy and attractive too but I find it hard to engage with their body in any masculine or genderless way.  Naturally, I don't use gendered words in bed unless its been explicitly stated. One of my NB partners told me that they are happy with some gendered 'nicknames and descriptors'  like bitch, beautiful, hoe, bro (stuff like that). I still feel a bit odd using them because I would probably only want to use fem ones. I would rather not say much during sex to avoid leaning too much to one gender with my diction.   


I stress during sex sometimes about how much I want to engage with their feminine body and not sure how that effects them. I would eventually like to talk to them about this but also want to be careful to not contribute to any dysphoria.   


Long story short I am trying to be true to my sexuality while also respecting my partner's Identity.

I became familiar with the term a year ago

Also never really minded being a boy too much in like plays and stuff, I felt mildly strange or uncomfortable but it was still fun

I had literally not once ever questioned my gender but it’s weird bc now I am and I don’t know if it’s just hallucinating things or I _think_ I’m non-binary just because

435,2019-06-10 00:49:43,byrfea,3,4,"CW: specific mention of anatomy/sex organs, light mention of sex acts 

I apologize in advance for the extreme length of this post, I just want to make sure I cover everything. I'll put the questions first:

1) if your gender-questioning, gently androgynous AFAB friend eventually decided they were cis after all, would you stop feeling as connected to them, even if the only thing that changed was their pronouns? Be honest, I want to know the worst case scenario. 

2) If you've experienced something similar, how were/are you able to exist comfortably in various gendered communities? I don't think I could sustainably ""femme it up"" enough to pass for all-woman and be accepted by other women unless we go *Handmaids Tale* (god forbid) and my life depends on it.

3) if it's even an option, what is the etiquette of identifying as gender non-conforming while continuing to use birth pronouns? Firmly non-binary folks, how do you feel when other people do this? Do you make a distinction between nonbinary and nonconforming, and does it help?

4) most importantly, is it now appropriative rather than supportive for me to make aggressively pro-trans pro-enby jokes on social media? I do it a lot, but I will gladly stop if the ethics seem questionable. Ex: my friend posted a meme the other day stating that the moon was a lesbian, I added that the moon is probably a trans lesbian, since it existed as collision debris for a long time but has been out as The Moon for 4.5 billion years. They loved it, but I wonder if they'd love it less if I finally reveal I'm probably cis.

I'm 22 years old and AFAB. I usually use she/her pronouns. I have never been identified by a stranger as anything other than a woman, though I do get some double takes from time to time because of the way I dress (more on this later). I struggled to ""fit in"" with most women my whole life, and was definitely a ""tomboy"" as a kid. Lately I've had an easier time making friends with other cis women and I love my cis woman friends, but I still feel like I'm not fully part of the ""woman club"" a lot of the time. I feel horrible, vulnerable, and infantilized in almost all dresses/skirts/etc for many reasons, one being that my shoulders are naturally significantly broader than my hips and I'm slightly more muscular than average, so I feel like a rhinoceros in anything ""cute"". My ideal body is even more muscular than my current body - I would like to have arms like a somewhat fit cis man, definitely not a bodybuilder-level, but toned like a man's. I'm working on that. My sort-of-enormous ""biker calves"" are commented on by aqcuaintences pretty frequently, and they're admittedly my favorite part of me. I've got angular features that I try to emphasize as much as possible. Most, but not all of the time, I feel most like myself in very androgynous clothing. Neckties, men's shoes, blazers etc. Some days I feel very masculine, other days I feel more neutral or neutral-femme. I make friends the quickest with non binary and trans people and implicitly trust them more than anyone else. Enby folks specifically are the only people I feel I can truly relax and be myself around. I get a tangible rush of dopamine every time a friend of mine who has been living as cis comes out  as trans or enby. BUT.

They/them pronouns on their own feel alienating to me (they/them AND she/her together could totally work.) I don't have any dysphoria associated with my secondary sex characteristics. I hate bras and sometimes I like to lightly bind or conceal my (small) breasts for certain outfits, but their presence causes me no distress and sometimes I even like that they are there. I dislike being penetrated sexually, but I have no problem with my vulva and I don't wish I had something else. My voice is low for a cis woman, so I'm okay with where it is. I don't strongly identify with she/her pronouns, but they seem ever so slightly more right than the other options for now, mostly because I like the idea that the way I express my gender implies that ""she"" is an almost-meaningless term. I have a very supportive family in which almost all traditional gender roles were naturally reversed, and gender was only ever a ""big deal"" in my household because my mom is a die-hard radical feminist. Former TERF, now a vocal and vehement T\*I\*RF of her own volition.

What's causing me distress is that I know plenty of folks who present more femme/masc than I would ever be comfortable doing and strongly identify as non-binary. Other than my general lack of dysphoria, I \*should\* identify as enby, right down to my social behavior. Admittedly, I'm of the abstract opinion that the gender binary should be destroyed and EVERYONE should eventually be referred to by one gender neutral pronoun (just an opinion, I'm open to hear what more gender nonconforming folks feel about that). Until then, though, I sort of feel that I might do more to dismantle the binary by continuing to use she/her pronouns than I would if I went by they/them, although the term ""gender nonconforming"" feels exactly right for me.  I am deeply worried that my finally deciding to keep my she/her pronouns will ""other"" me from literally every available community - not part of the ""woman club"" because I present like either a man or an androgynous person and would only present more femme if I was literally being held at gunpoint, not part of the ""man club"" because I'm a she, and not part of the ""non binary club"" because I use the pronouns associated with my birth sex. I'm worried that my non binary friendships are conditional on the fact that I \*look and act\* enby and have indicated that I might be, but as soon as I decide to keep my pronouns they won't feel safe anymore and they'll shut me out.

437,2019-06-10 01:56:31,bys21q,12,9,"So I’ve finally realized that I don’t have to be FTM to not identify as a girl. Idk why it took me so long because I’ve always felt like I didn’t like the way my body looked; I’m curvy, even though I’m skinny, got hips and am blessed in the chest. I’ve always tried to dress up femme because I was born as a girl but only really felt good about it in the “I know other people think I look good in this outfit” kind of way. I love men’s clothes, but I don’t wear them because I know I’ll never look like a man looks in men’s clothes, and that makes me feel more dysphoric. 

Before anyone says that clothes aren’t gendered, I have to say that to me, they are. Gendering clothing helps me to wear things that make me feel more like myself, and I think that’s okay. 

I started dating a non-binary person and felt like they opened my eyes to a whole new world. Haven’t really come out to anyone, but that’s mostly just because I haven’t felt like I’ve needed to. I think most of my friends have known for a while, even if it hasn’t been put into words.

My partner recently came out to me (F) as possibly MtF binary trans. All was good. I love helping him (he/him preferred pronouns currently) discover more about himself, and I love supporting him on this journey. 

But then he introduced me to what I now know as non binary. I always knew what it was, but this was the first time I really understood what it meant. And it all clicked for me. I never felt comfortable in my identity as a woman. But I also didn’t really feel like a man. I felt somewhere...in between? Or maybe, neither?

This would be a great end to the story. But there’s a catch - I am AFAB and I enjoy presenting female. I wear female clothes and I like presenting feminine. I wouldn’t change that. He keeps telling me that’s okay - and that gender expression and gender identity are two totally different things. He says, my expression is female but my identity is NB. 

I know if anybody else told me they were female-presenting NB I wouldn’t bat an eyelash. You do you, fuck yeah. But when it comes to me...I can’t help but really struggle with my own validity. Like, guys...I REALLY present feminine. And I know that nobody that saw me walking down the street would ever think I’m anything but cis-F. And that really, really bothers me. I considered dressing more androgynously to get the point across that I’m NB, but that made me sad and uncomfortable because I would rather PHYSICALLY present as female. It’s just not always female up in my brain. 

I hate all pronouns. I don’t like being called she/her, he/his, or even they/them. It all feels wrong. I hate all of them for me. I feel genderless up in my brain. I just want to be me.

On top of all this, I’m worried that people will look at me, lookin like a cis girl dating a trans girl, and assume that I’m saying I’m NB just because my partner is trans. I don’t want people thinking I’m just “copying” my partner. That hurts a lot to think about. 

Sorry guys. This is a lot of word salad. I just wanna know what you guys think. I still have a lot of research and self-discovery to do.

I'm afab, and have always thought of myself as just a butch lesbian, but recently I've been questioning if I'm actually not as cis as I thought. I get a sense of euphoria when I'm referred to as not female, and I've been really enjoying presenting super masc. I've found I get uncomfortable about my chest when I'm in public, and I just got a binder and I feel so happy when I wear it. I love how I look in male clothing, and got a haircut that I adore because I look more masc. I've gotten uncomfortable being referred to as a girl and have been intentionally lowering my voice and moving in a more 'masculine' way. I despise my hips and curves and want a sharper jawline.

That's not to say I don't like my feminine side though, I like skirts and crop tops and makeup and my lesbian identifier. I don't want facial hair and don't care about my chest when I'm alone or naked (most the time).

(TW: ED) I have a diagnosed eating disorder and body dysmorphia - so I guess what's really messing me up is am I feeling this way because of dysphoria or dysmorphia? Am I questioning being trans as a way of coping with my general hatred of my body and with the hope that there's a way for me to like myself (by transitioning)? Or am I actually trans but just confused by my mental illness? 

I guess I just want to know how you guys realised you were non binary and what your thoughts about my situation are?

469,2019-06-10 19:29:57,bz25x4,8,26,"I posted this on my Instagram but I'm just wondering if anyone here can relate.

Real talk - the past year and a half has been the hardest of my life when it comes to being queer. Confidence in who I was and that I was doing the right thing came naturally to me as a 13 year old in 2007, and I really loved being part of the gay community. When I was 18 I had no inner conflict about adding the term nonbinary - it just felt like a natural extension of who I already knew I was. I knew I was lucky to be one of the first of an era to grow up surrounded by support. This is why it floored me that I have felt so much shame and doubt when it became necessary to actually DO something about the dysphoria I was feeling. 

Being nonbinary right now is not easy and I have felt guilt over every possible thing. Asking people to use they/them pronouns when I know it's difficult. The idea that my weirdness makes things harder for binary trans people. Worrying I was making myself less attractive and therefore less valuable as a partner.  Feeling broken/defective/different.  People fighting over my right to stay part of the lesbian community. Feeling guilty for wanting the things I did and wondering if I was somehow faking it. Feeling like I shouldn't be making a big deal out of things, that gender wasn't important enough for all this. These hurtful ideas come from both inside and outside the LGBT community, and it adds up. And all of this has come with a lot of doubt that I'm doing the right thing. 

It is hard to feel proud when you're the butt of so many jokes. It's hard to exist with an identity that is difficult to explain. It's also hard to be proud when you aren't sure who you are or where you fit. And when your identity doesn't fit easily into the world. Everything has been a lot harder emotionally than I expected, and then I felt ashamed about that because being confident in being queer was important to me. 

Right now I am slowly building up confidence in who I am and what feels comfortable for me now. I have come along way and I have a long way to go still.

I am a genderfluid demigirl and as it is pride month I would love to read/watch/play media with enby representation.

Problem is: It is hard to find. And there is not much of it around.

I tried searching whether or not there was a thread like this already, but only found a rather old ""looking for books"" posting. Hence I hope it is okay for me to ask this here.

So far the only media I can think of are:

* Magnus Chase (with Alex being gender fluid)

* Billions

* Well, I guess via word of god there is also the new John Wick with Asias character being enby - but it is never been brought it.

Outside of those three things I can think of a couple of anime/manga, that either feature explicitely non-binary characters (Angel Sanctuary) or characters left open to interpretation (Made in Abyss). But yeah. It is not much.

Here goes:

U walk into a buffet with cakes. The moment u walk through the door, someone hands u a piece of apple cake and says ""this is ur cake"". Now, if u love apple cake (aka. ur cis) this is fine. U keep on with ur apple cake and have a great time

But say u hate apple cake. It's the worst. Why did they hand u the apple cake? U didn't ask for this! What are u gonna do about it, just walk around with a cake u can't enjoy? This is dysphoria, u are trans. U have something, but u don't want it

On the other hand, what if ur just ok with the apple cake? It's not ur favorite, but if offered u would probably eat some of it. U walk around nibbling on the apple cake every now and then, but then u spot it...! A nice looking chocolate cake on one of the tables. U ask urself ""why couldn't i have that instead?""

Someone walks by and sees u looking longingly at the chocolate cake. They ask if u would rather have a piece of that. Ur so happy! Yes, of course! U are experiencing euphoria. U have something, and ur ok with it, but there's something else u would rather have

Now this probably sounds like it's only for binary people, but we all know there are more cakes than just apple and chocolate! U can mix and match, make ur own cake, decorate it however u want!

There u go, I hope this makes sense for anyone else, I just wanted to share

\- I think the only time that I was okay with my body was when I did sports and was extremely fit. Since I can no longer play sports I've gained weight so I'm not the biggest fan of my body.  

\- I've started using they/them pronouns just to see if I felt any different. I like it but also don't hate when people use she/her. I just hate when people use female based names (lady, girl, etc). 

\- I haven't really felt feminine lately. Like I just feel like a genderless blob.

507,2019-06-11 22:04:26,bziurt,0,3,"I've known I'm at least partially nonbinary for a couple years now, and over a year ago I came out at my work, which was a restaurant where I worked mostly in the back/kitchen. My friend there came out as a trans man (bigender but only close queer friends know that), and when I revealed to him that I'm nb, he kindly took it upon himself to come out for me, telling people when I'm not around to use they/them! I appreciated this a whole heckin lot, although it did kind of enable my shy/controntation issues.


Work and friends from work were my only social network, so I was surrounded by correct genderring for many months which gave me  euphoria until I decided to quit work to focus on going back to college. When my lab partners used ""she"", I was actually confused at first who they were referring to, but (here's me being STOPID), I decided not to tell them my pronouns. I *still* haven't told anyone at that community college or the university I transferred to this Spring (and now I'm unexpectedly close to recent lab group) anything gender-wise. And there's this girl in the group who almost seems to go out of her way to use gendered terms for me, and even though I feel pretty down from it, I don't correct her.


Why? Well....I'm loud, friendly, etc, but contradictingly extremely shy about things I deeply feel related to myself.


Here's my question/dilemma: I want to ""re-come out"", and it'd be my first time doing the work myself. I'm debating if it's worth it, and the scope of task i.e. strangers, certain people. What makes it more complicated is I'm not sure how much of my physical dysphoria stems from how others would gender those parts, and being perceived as having enough features to be allowed to count. There are some days/month every few months where I truly do see myself wanting to start low dose of T in future, then other time where I'm quite content with my body and that's a problem because of how feminine I like to present sometimes. Regardless of my body or presentation, I think of myself more in terms of a very girly bi buy (if I had to use gendered terms), and my female friendships, being called GURL, etc I see in relation to being the queer male friend, but I fear if I choose not to start T because of uncertainty, everyone around me won't get it.

My appearance will never get gendered correctly, meaning I would be committing to coming out all the time, and then there's the social element of knowing some people just won't use they/them (I'm in a mental health support group and some members have brain damage and I genuinely don't care what they call me) but there's the social anxiety of allies who know me interrupting the flow of the group meeting to go ""They! They!""



You know what? Just typing this has helped me work through that when I come out to people, that process just also has to include how to (not) react to misgendering! I can just tell people to think of me as a feminine guy if they must! I can just use words!!!!!!

I've been doing a lot of gender exploration lately, and based on my experiences with both gender dysphoria and euphoria, I think I might feel a lot better and more like myself if I ""masculinized"" my body somewhat with T and/or top surgery. (See my post history if you're curious) However, I struggle with whether or not I want to be seen as a binary man. I just have a really hard time imagining it, and I worry that it would feel just as constricting and false as being a binary ""woman"" feels. 

Here's the thing: I have broad shoulders, a large frame, and a deep voice already, and the men in my family are pretty hairy. And I'm not very femme in my presentation - not exactly butch, but I don't like makeup, prefer to wear men's clothes, etc. I'm fairly certain that, if I went on T, I would start passing as a cis man pretty quickly. So part of me is like ""well, sure, I could call myself non-binary, but if the world is going to see me as a man, what's the point?"" 

And I know that it's as much about how I see myself as how the world sees me, but part of my hesitation with transitioning is being put into the male *category.* My therapist once observed that my main identification with femaleness is through community/social ties and that's really important to me - I especially love connecting with queer women as a ... woman-adjacent person.

Anyway, that got long, but really, I would love to hear from AFAB transmasc ppl who don't identify as binary men - what's your thought process/journey been like?

A little background to this, my beliefs are probably best described as pagan and discovering this story was actually one thing that led to a major cognition on my gender journey.

Different versions of this story exist, and to me that's part of the beauty of stories with oral tradition; just as it was thousands of years ago, every individual's telling of the story is different, and this is mine. To my knowledge, and I'm far from an expert, a story a lot like the version presented here was widely told in the ancient city of Akkad around 3200 BC. (The Akkadian/Sumerian mythos is actually remarkably diverse, including binary trans and genderfluid rep as well)

I'm sure a lot of people here have heard of the story before, but I hope some of you find this interesting! I tried to write in a deliberately archaic style, I hope it's not overdone or overly awkward.

**The Descent of Inana**


Inana, draped in beads of lapis, abandoned the thrones of Heaven and Earth and descended to Kur-nu-gu, the place of no return, where the mortal dead linger in darkness. Clay be their bread, and mud their water, as is the decree of Ereshkigal who reigns as Queen in Kur-nu-gu.

Inana descended to Kur-nu-gu, the realm of Ereshkigal, around which the Queen of Kur-nu-gu had erected seven gates.

Inana spoke to Nehu, the gatekeeper, saying: ""Nehu, open up the gates of Kur-nu-gu, that I may look upon the face of my sister Ereshkigal.""

The gatekeeper Nehu made no motion, so Inana spoke again, saying: ""Let the gates be open so that I may enter, or I shall rend open the gates, leading up the dead to Earth, where they shall feast upon the living. Justice be my will, for Justice be mine to wield.""

Troubled, Nehu said: ""Wait, my Lady Inana, and I shall speak to my mistress Ereshkigal.""

So Nehu went from the gate to the house of his mistress Ereshkigal, saying: ""There is a lone girl at the gates of Kur-nu-gu, being your sister Inana. She has abandoned the thrones of Heaven and Earth and seeks admittance to Kur-nu-gu.""

Ereshkigal was enraged, but said: ""Nehu, return to the gates and admit my sister Inana. Bring her to my palace at Irkalla, that I may look upon her face, being sure that the ancient rites are upheld.""

Nehu left the house of his mistress and returned to the gates, saying unto Inana: ""My Lady Inana, the Queen Ereshkigal begs you entry.""

The first gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the beads of lapis from Inana.

And Inana was wroth, demanding: ""By what authority do you lay your hands upon me, who wields the sword of Justice, and in whose name all life springs forth?""

And Nehu said: ""In this place you have no authority, my Lady Inana. In the place of no return, my mistress Ereshkigal rules above all others. Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The second gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the crown of Heaven from Inana's head.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The third gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the emblem of the star from Inana's neck.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The fourth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the gold and jewels from Inana's wrists and fingers.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The fifth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the sandals from Inana's feet.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The sixth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the sacred golden belt of Ouroboros from Inana's waist. 

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

The seventh gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the brilliant white robe from around Inana's body.

Inana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""

And Inana stood alongside Nehu at Irkalla the throne of Ereshkigal, naked, stripped not only of her robe but also of the instruments of her authority, power, and justice.

Ereshkigal spoke her judgement: ""Fool sister, your authority is forfeit in this place. You willingly submit yourself to my will, and thus do I pass sentence upon you. Clay be your bread, and mud your water, as is my decree. The gates are sealed!""

And Ereshkigal called forth her vizier Namtar, the demon of the plagues. Namtar had the head of a viper and his body was skeletal, and he embraced Inana, causing sixty plagues to ravage her body.

And Inana was thrown into a cell, and the light disappeared from her eyes. She saw only darkness, and clay was her bread, and mud her water.

Great change came upon the earth. The rabbits of the field no longer bore forth young. Spouses no longer caressed, nor longed to lie together, and love was foreign to all the inhabitants of the Earth. The priests of Inana were mournful, for none wished to spend their time in song and merriment.

Papsukkal the brother of Inana was greatly troubled, and sought the counsel of the great god Enki.

Enki, in his wisdom, called forth a person from the dirt, being neither male nor female, and named them Asu-shu-namir, meaning ""shining one"".

Asu-shu-namir, being a creation of the great god Enki, freely walked through the gates of Kur-nu-gu and looked upon the face of Ereshkigal.

Ereshkigal was at once struck with lust for Asu-shu-namir, desiring greatly to lie with them.

Ereshkigal threw a tremendous feast in the name of Asu-shu-namir, offering up to them her finest wine.

But Asu-shu-namir was wise, and knew that to accept the offerings of the dead in their realm was to consign themself to Kur-nu-gu and the judgement of Ereshkigal.

Asu-shu-namir tasted neither meat nor wine in Kur-nu-gu, but danced sensually for Ereshkigal, enthralling her with their charms.

When Ereshkigal had imbued deeply of the wine, Asu-shu-namir drew close to Ereshkigal, saying: ""Mighty and beautiful Ereshkigal, is it not true that you guard the water of life? Nothing more have I ever longed to taste.""

Ereshkigal was overcome with longing, and ordered Namtar to offer up the water of life unto Asu-shu-namir.

When Ereshkigal had fallen into drunkenness, Asu-shu-namir took the water of life and stole to the cell of Inana. Asu-shu-namir sprinkled the water of life into the eyes of the Queen of Heaven.

And those eyes shone with a living radiance, and Inana awoke and fled through the seven gates of Kur-nu-gu, returning to the thrones of Heaven and Earth.

The earth blossomed with radiance, and the rabbits of the field brought forth young, and spouses longed to lie together. Love was upon the Earth, and the priests of Inana were gladdened at the return of song and merriment.

But Ereshkigal awakened as Asu-shu-namir was passing through the final gate of Kur-nu-gu, and declared her vengeance upon them, saying: ""In the shadows shall you abide, your kind condemned to darkness all their days.""

Asu-shu-namir was cast out of Kur-nu-gu, and returned to the Lady Inana, telling her of their plight.

And Inana consoled Asu-shu-namir, saying: ""Beloved Asu-shu-namir, even I may not remove the curse of Ereshkigal. Truly shall you abide in the shadows. But you have delivered me from the shadows of Kur-nu-gu, and my gratitude is ever yours. I pray that a measure of justice be done to you by my three blessings.""

""First, that you and those like you be blessed by prophecy. You shall have the wisdom of the stars, and herald the tidings of the planets.""

""Second, that you and those like you are given healing in your fingertips. As you restored me to the heavens, so to shall you restore life.""

""Third, that you and those like you are exalted as my priests. You shall carry my voice in your throats and my beauty in your hearts. And when the water of life is delivered from Kur-nu-gu, so too shall you be delivered from the curse of Ereshkigal. You shall lead the world into an exalted age.

To my knowledge, and I\'m far from an expert, a story a lot like the version presented here was widely told in the ancient city of Akkad around 3200 BC. (The Akkadian/Sumerian mythos is actually remarkably diverse, including binary trans and genderfluid rep as well)\n\nI\'m sure a lot of people here have heard of the story before, but I hope some of you find this interesting! I tried to write in a deliberately archaic style, I hope it\'s not overdone or overly awkward.\n\n***\n**The Descent of Inana**\n\n\nInana, draped in beads of lapis, abandoned the thrones of Heaven and Earth and descended to Kur-nu-gu, the place of no return, where the mortal dead linger in darkness. Clay be their bread, and mud their water, as is the decree of Ereshkigal who reigns as Queen in Kur-nu-gu.\n\nInana descended to Kur-nu-gu, the realm of Ereshkigal, around which the Queen of Kur-nu-gu had erected seven gates.\n\nInana spoke to Nehu, the gatekeeper, saying: ""Nehu, open up the gates of Kur-nu-gu, that I may look upon the face of my sister Ereshkigal.""\n\nThe gatekeeper Nehu made no motion, so Inana spoke again, saying: ""Let the gates be open so that I may enter, or I shall rend open the gates, leading up the dead to Earth, where they shall feast upon the living. Justice be my will, for Justice be mine to wield.""\n\nTroubled, Nehu said: ""Wait, my Lady Inana, and I shall speak to my mistress Ereshkigal.""\n\nSo Nehu went from the gate to the house of his mistress Ereshkigal, saying: ""There is a lone girl at the gates of Kur-nu-gu, being your sister Inana. She has abandoned the thrones of Heaven and Earth and seeks admittance to Kur-nu-gu.""\n\nEreshkigal was enraged, but said: ""Nehu, return to the gates and admit my sister Inana. Bring her to my palace at Irkalla, that I may look upon her face, being sure that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nNehu left the house of his mistress and returned to the gates, saying unto Inana: ""My Lady Inana, the Queen Ereshkigal begs you entry.""\n\nThe first gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the beads of lapis from Inana.\n\nAnd Inana was wroth, demanding: ""By what authority do you lay your hands upon me, who wields the sword of Justice, and in whose name all life springs forth?""\n\nAnd Nehu said: ""In this place you have no authority, my Lady Inana. In the place of no return, my mistress Ereshkigal rules above all others. Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nThe second gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the crown of Heaven from Inana\'s head.\n\nInana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nThe third gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the emblem of the star from Inana\'s neck.\n\nInana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nThe fourth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the gold and jewels from Inana\'s wrists and fingers.\n\nInana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nThe fifth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the sandals from Inana\'s feet.\n\nInana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nThe sixth gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the sacred golden belt of Ouroboros from Inana\'s waist. \n\nInana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nThe seventh gate of Kur-nu-gu was opened, and Inana stepped through. Nehu took the brilliant white robe from around Inana\'s body.\n\nInana demanded: ""What is this?"" And Nehu said: ""Be silent, and be satisfied that the ancient rites are upheld.""\n\nAnd Inana stood alongside Nehu at Irkalla the throne of Ereshkigal, naked, stripped not only of her robe but also of the instruments of her authority, power, and justice.\n\nEreshkigal spoke her judgement: ""Fool sister, your authority is forfeit in this place. You willingly submit yourself to my will, and thus do I pass sentence upon you. Clay be your bread, and mud your water, as is my decree. The gates are sealed!""\n\nAnd Ereshkigal called forth her vizier Namtar, the demon of the plagues. Namtar had the head of a viper and his body was skeletal, and he embraced Inana, causing sixty plagues to ravage her body.\n\nAnd Inana was thrown into a cell, and the light disappeared from her eyes. She saw only darkness, and clay was her bread, and mud her water.\n\nGreat change came upon the earth. The rabbits of the field no longer bore forth young. Spouses no longer caressed, nor longed to lie together, and love was foreign to all the inhabitants of the Earth. The priests of Inana were mournful, for none wished to spend their time in song and merriment.\n\nPapsukkal the brother of Inana was greatly troubled, and sought the counsel of the great god Enki.\n\nEnki, in his wisdom, called forth a person from the dirt, being neither male nor female, and named them Asu-shu-namir, meaning ""shining one"".\n\nAsu-shu-namir, being a creation of the great god Enki, freely walked through the gates of Kur-nu-gu and looked upon the face of Ereshkigal.\n\nEreshkigal was at once struck with lust for Asu-shu-namir, desiring greatly to lie with them.\n\nEreshkigal threw a tremendous feast in the name of Asu-shu-namir, offering up to them her finest wine.\n\nBut Asu-shu-namir was wise, and knew that to accept the offerings of the dead in their realm was to consign themself to Kur-nu-gu and the judgement of Ereshkigal.\n\nAsu-shu-namir tasted neither meat nor wine in Kur-nu-gu, but danced sensually for Ereshkigal, enthralling her with their charms.\n\nWhen Ereshkigal had imbued deeply of the wine, Asu-shu-namir drew close to Ereshkigal, saying: ""Mighty and beautiful Ereshkigal, is it not true that you guard the water of life? Nothing more have I ever longed to taste.""\n\nEreshkigal was overcome with longing, and ordered Namtar to offer up the water of life unto Asu-shu-namir.\n\nWhen Ereshkigal had fallen into drunkenness, Asu-shu-namir took the water of life and stole to the cell of Inana. Asu-shu-namir sprinkled the water of life into the eyes of the Queen of Heaven.\n\nAnd those eyes shone with a living radiance, and Inana awoke and fled through the seven gates of Kur-nu-gu, returning to the thrones of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe earth blossomed with radiance, and the rabbits of the field brought forth young, and spouses longed to lie together. Love was upon the Earth, and the priests of Inana were gladdened at the return of song and merriment.\n\nBut Ereshkigal awakened as Asu-shu-namir was passing through the final gate of Kur-nu-gu, and declared her vengeance upon them, saying: ""In the shadows shall you abide, your kind condemned to darkness all their days.""\n\nAsu-shu-namir was cast out of Kur-nu-gu, and returned to the Lady Inana, telling her of their plight.\n\nAnd Inana consoled Asu-shu-namir, saying: ""Beloved Asu-shu-namir, even I may not remove the curse of Ereshkigal. Truly shall you abide in the shadows. But you have delivered me from the shadows of Kur-nu-gu, and my gratitude is ever yours. I pray that a measure of justice be done to you by my three blessings.""\n\n""First, that you and those like you be blessed by prophecy. You shall have the wisdom of the stars, and herald the tidings of the planets.""\n\n""Second, that you and those like you are given healing in your fingertips. As you restored me to the heavens, so to shall you restore life.""\n\n""Third, that you and those like you are exalted as my priests. You shall carry my voice in your throats and my beauty in your hearts. And when the water of life is delivered from Kur-nu-gu, so too shall you be delivered from the curse of Ereshkigal. You shall lead the world into an exalted age.

b) I am into competitive things like running, triathlons, etc., which group people by age and sex for performance reasons.

Especially since I've had surgery. Feels extremely awkward trying to run as a lady.   \n\n\nComments, advice, and free hugs are all appreciated.   \n\n\nThanks guys.

My partner recently mentioned how excited he is to become a dad one day. This is great, since we are both on the same page about parenthood, but it made me think....

What will our children call me? The idea of being called ""mom"" makes me feel uneasy. I'm still trying to figure out my place in society, as I've only come out to certain people within the last year. I've felt ""different"" my whole life, but have only found the vocabulary to define my gender as of recently.

I also dont want to be called ""dad"". While I'm gender fluid, I typically present more towards the femme end of the spectrum and the idea of being called ""dad"" just doesn't feel right. 

My question is... If the title of ""mom"" and ""dad"" both make me feel uneasy... then what should my future children call me? By my name? Should they call me ""parental unit""? 

The more I explore my gender and learn about myself, the more I realize that I have so much to unlearning to do from being force fed the gender binary while growing up.

Okay, so up until the age of about 12 or 13, I didn't feel at all weird about both my gender, or sexuality.

I've also never liked dressing up. I absolutely HATE wearing a suit, or really wearing anything ""masculine"" I hate the ""men's"" deodorant, soap, literally anything like that. I think it smells gross, I think it looks bad on me, I hate all of it.

But even after all of this, I don't exactly feel like I should be a girl. I think that would make me non-binary, but I don't know.

703,2019-06-16 16:04:12,c1biap,14,13,"Hello, enby folks! I'm a bisexual cis man (slightly nonconforming sometimes) in an open polyamorous relationship with multiple partners.

Some of these partners are nonbinary, but they have different preferences when it comes to pronouns, labels, and overall gender dynamics in our respective relationships.

One prefers to take on roles that have traditionally been regarded as masculine, one tends toward more feminine coded roles, and another does both. I grew up in an open minded household, but I wasn't introduced to the concept of nonbinary genders until a couple years ago, so I'm still learning how a lot of these things work. I want to understand what roles I should have in each of my relationships, and I want to do what I can to make sure my partners feel as comfortable as possible. Relationships, after all, are about finding a good balance between all participants.

Also, and this is what I most need help with, not all of my nonbinary partners prefer to use they/them pronouns all the time. One goes by ei/em/eir, while another goes by xey/xem, etc. I was only introduced to more complex pronoun politics fairly recently, so I often have trouble with them. I've finally gotten the hang of they/them, but other nonbinary pronouns just don't stick for me, no matter how hard I try.

In addition to pronouns, some of them wish to be called my ""datemate,"" or ""partner,"" or ""theyfriend."" It's a lot to keep track of, and I already have pretty significant memory problems as it is, so it's even more of a challenge for me.

My question is, how do I keep track of all this information when I am in a romantic or sexual relationship with so many people with different preferences? I really care about all of my partners, even if we're in the early stages of dating or even being FWBs; I definitely don't want to subject anyone to dysphoria if I can help it, and I want to be as thoughtful a boyfriend and partner as I can be.

A couple of weeks ago I began to question my gender, and recently came to the conclusion that I’m probably a demigirl. For context, I’m AFAB, and I’ve always been quite the oddball. My interests between “girly” stuff and “manly” stuff have fluctuated greatly ever since I was younger. I currently find myself stuck in the middle. Even though I’ve begun to identify as a demigirl and now prefer for people to use not just she/her but also they/them, I still feel uncertain. 

I’ve read up many stories and asks on this sub and other sites about people asking about being Demi, however I’m not sure if I specifically relate to every feeling other AFAB demigirls have. 

For example: I can relate to the desire to want to wear less feminine clothing and have variety, not wanting a super feminine attitude but not a masculine one either (for me personally the other part of my gender would be non-specific), liking the idea of using both she and they pronouns, etc.
However, I don’t seem to feel a lot of other things that AFAB demigirls often express for example: heavily disliking their chests (I don’t care that I have a decently sized chest and don’t feel the need to bind/feel dysphoric about it), I don’t dislike any of my outer more feminine features (Again, to me it makes no difference whether I have them or not), etc.

I wanted some advice from other fellow demigirls and their experiences to see if I have finally found the fight identification for myself. A while ago, I had come to terms with the fact that I’m asexual, which is what prompted me to start thinking more about my gender. 
I know that there aren’t specific “criteria” or highly specific signs that validate an individual as Demi, but I still am unsure if the way I look or the fact that I don’t really experience dysphoria will make others say I’m not actually Demi.

Ever since I can recall, in my nighttime dreams, I am (usually) a man. Therefore, I often have dreams involving male genitalia or sexual dreams where I am male. I obviously cannot actually imagine having a penis on my body so my dream brain makes the best of it. 

I'm curious if wearing a packer might help me *feel* more male and enhance my dream-body-image. Long story short, I'm not interested on going on T at this time. 

So. Can anyone recommend a brand of packer? I know they come in various grades. Some are less realistic and cheaper. Are the expensive ones worth it?

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t want to write about you anymore.

Sometimes I wish you weren’t such a large part of me. Sometimes I wish that my existence wasn’t defined by you. I sometimes wonder what it would be like if I didn’t think about you day in and day out. I’m not sure I want to be with you anymore. Because, honestly, you’re taking over my life.

I want you to be part of me, but it’s hard. You take over me, you are the only thing that I feel defines me anymore.

How do I define myself when the labels are constantly changing? How do I define myself when I know I’m not accepted by you? How do I define myself when I know that no words can explain how I feel- that the abstract concepts in my mind will never be able to be truly expressed because I know you won’t understand?

And so, I don’t want to write about you anymore. Because sometimes I wish you weren’t a part of me.

I wish I could just exist. The way you tell me to be loud and proud isn’t *me.* I try, I do. But how can I kiss her when all your eyes are on me, all my friends whose one time to be themselves is here, how do I live up to such an expectation when I don’t even know what I expect of myself? When I don’t know truly who I am? I want to be alone with her, but the feeling to be out next to you is too overwhelming. I want to kiss her, but I can’t with all eyes towards me.

I wish you weren’t all I ever think about. All that I could be doing and choose not to, all I could be changing and decide to be lazy. How can I be loud and proud when I’m quiet? When my natural state is not at rallies, even though my heart wants to be there, is confusing. My head and heart are at war with each other. One wants to celebrate, tell off everyone opposing you. The other wants to sit down and read with my cat by my side. But more and more, I’ve been starting to lose that other part- fitting into a form of what you expect from me. How do I make a difference but still be quiet, when silence is an active form of oppression against those I care about?

I don’t want to write about you anymore. I don’t want to think about you, have every minute of every hour of every day defined by you. If I were in the right mind, I’d tear down your symbols from my room. Because all I want is to exist. Where I don’t need a name, a title, something for people to define me by. I just want to be me.

And if I keep by you, still, I’ll never get peace.

I’ll never get peace because I don’t understand myself. And to survive in your world, I have to. I have to tell everyone who I am. I just want this to be mine. But now I have to share it with everyone else. I’ll have to tell them to, even though I just want to be alone. Or with her. Everyone expects so much of me now. They expect me to be a certain way, to be a certain someone. I just want this to be my own, before it was tainted by the opinions of others and my own self-pity. I just want this to be my own, kept in a lockbox behind my heart. No matter how much I deny it, I know that you’re still a part of me. I just wish we didn’t have to tell everyone about it.

Disclaimer: descriptions of sexual nature.

I dress quite androgynous and only wear colours black, red and gold (jewelry, details on shoes..). So it appears quite neat and really neither/both feminine and masculine. Though people have a tendency to sometimes point out I ""dress as if I were a guy"". When I was younger I always wished to buy guy clothes but I weren't allowed (though those clothes were androgynous as well). I try to appear completely flat-chested, which isn't hard at all as I could literally put a dress shirt on and appear flat. It's harder with tighter clothes such as jumpers, which I absolutely love so that's a bit unfortunate. I always felt uncomfortable when it came to my chest and am pretty happy I'm almost flat-chested. Sometimes I wish I had no chest at all and sometimes I'm content with its appearance as it is (it's pretty unnoticable even by me most of the time as it's that flat, but I still feel the discomfort, especially if others can see it). I'm not sure whether I'd like to have a top surgery though, and not sure whether it has anything to do with it, but I'm autistic and have a problem with changes.

I don't feel comfortable being seen as a girl, and I always present as a guy online. I even have a pseudonim, Mikhail (Mee-kale). Though my birth name is a unisex one, so that's a plus. I always play male characters in games, would take male roles irl and would relate to guys more during my life. I have better connections with guys than with girls. With girls it's sort of shallow and I don't feel comfortable being emotionally vulnerable or touchy with them, while I'm perfectly comfortable with guys. My best friend is a guy and guy friends are the only ones I've ever been emotionally intimate with. 

I'm quite dominant in nature and am sort of annoyed by passive submissiveness. Which is the description of most girls I met lol. So that's another reason I may not click with girls that much. Also perhaps TMI, but I'm always the penetrator in my fantasies (of guys) and am pretty much just ""attracted"" to sexually submissive males. I'm on the asexual spectrum and have very little to no interest to pursue those fantasies (I may be aegosexual or something, I don't really care I just go by asexual). I'm also 100% aromantic. Not sure whether any of this plays a role in how I perceive myself. This is another reason I'm a bit uncomfortable being perceived as a girl, as people associate girls with sexual submissiveness which is the farthest from the truth in my case. I'm perhaps 1% a sub at most, and even then I would be penetrated in the ass as a guy would. This is also the reason I feel uncomfortable about my reproductive system, the fact that I can get pregnant and also the fact that I was biologically predestined to be the penetrated one. It happens that I get quite uncomfortable having the genitals I do, but I don't really wish I had a penis either. It's quite confusing.

I have no problem with any pronouns tbh, but I prefer she/her irl as I'm biologically female and he/him online. And I don't really feel comfortable presenting as non-binary. 

I sort of see myself as a guy, but also as a girl and neither at the same time, and it varies. But the aforementioned characteristics of me always stay the same. I wouldn't go by another gender whether irl or online even if I realised I weren't cis as it feels unnecessary to me. I'm just trying to figure this out. I'm pretty sure I'm cis though, but idk.

Sometimes I wish I had no chest at all and sometimes I\'m content with its appearance as it is (it\'s pretty unnoticable even by me most of the time as it\'s that flat, but I still feel the discomfort, especially if others can see it). I\'m not sure whether I\'d like to have a top surgery though, and not sure whether it has anything to do with it, but I\'m autistic and have a problem with changes.\n\nI don\'t feel comfortable being seen as a girl, and I always present as a guy online. I even have a pseudonim, Mikhail (Mee-kale). Though my birth name is a unisex one, so that\'s a plus. I always play male characters in games, would take male roles irl and would relate to guys more during my life. I have better connections with guys than with girls. With girls it\'s sort of shallow and I don\'t feel comfortable being emotionally vulnerable or touchy with them, while I\'m perfectly comfortable with guys. My best friend is a guy and guy friends are the only ones I\'ve ever been emotionally intimate with. \n\nI\'m quite dominant in nature and am sort of annoyed by passive submissiveness. Which is the description of most girls I met lol. So that\'s another reason I may not click with girls that much. Also perhaps TMI, but I\'m always the penetrator in my fantasies (of guys) and am pretty much just ""attracted"" to sexually submissive males. I\'m on the asexual spectrum and have very little to no interest to pursue those fantasies (I may be aegosexual or something, I don\'t really care I just go by asexual). I\'m also 100% aromantic. Not sure whether any of this plays a role in how I perceive myself. This is another reason I\'m a bit uncomfortable being perceived as a girl, as people associate girls with sexual submissiveness which is the farthest from the truth in my case. I\'m perhaps 1% a sub at most, and even then I would be penetrated in the ass as a guy would. This is also the reason I feel uncomfortable about my reproductive system, the fact that I can get pregnant and also the fact that I was biologically predestined to be the penetrated one. It happens that I get quite uncomfortable having the genitals I do, but I don\'t really wish I had a penis either. It\'s quite confusing.\n\nI have no problem with any pronouns tbh, but I prefer she/her irl as I\'m biologically female and he/him online. And I don\'t really feel comfortable presenting as non-binary. \n\nI sort of see myself as a guy, but also as a girl and neither at the same time, and it varies. But the aforementioned characteristics of me always stay the same. I wouldn\'t go by another gender whether irl or online even if I realised I weren\'t cis as it feels unnecessary to me. I\'m just trying to figure this out. I\'m pretty sure I\'m cis though, but idk.\n\nThank you for reading!', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Confused about my gender.', 'created': 1560833718.0}"

770,2019-06-17 23:11:43,c1um7b,2,2,"Hi all,

With mod permission, I wanted to share the info below about an online survey about AFAB trans folks' experiences accessing reproductive health care, and to invite you all to participate! The survey is for people of trans experience who are AFAB, age 18+, and live in the US. If you're part of the PRIDE Study, you may have already gotten an invite through that platform.

The researchers built the study in collaboration with a community advisory team of AFAB nonbinary folks and trans men (including me). While it's not perfect, we've worked hard to make the survey as inclusive and validating as possible -- for example, you can indicate what words you use for your body and the survey questions will mirror that language.

It would be amazing to have your experiences reflected in the study -- and if you have thoughts about the survey itself, I'm happy to answer questions or to pass feedback on to the team. (And please feel free to share the info elsewhere if you're comfortable doing so!)

Here's the official blurb:

Ibis Reproductive Health and The PRIDE Study are proud to launch a new survey to learn about the sexual and reproductive health care needs and experiences of transgender and gender expansive (TGE) people assigned female at birth. We are committed to hearing directly from those of us in the transgender and gender-expansive community to learn how to better meet all of our sexual and reproductive health care needs. Our study team worked closely with a community advisory team to develop a survey that affirms the diverse identities, experiences, and language that those of trans and/or gender-expansive experience use to define their experiences for themselves. We want to reach as many eligible people as possible to participate in this innovative study. You can participate in the survey here, and please feel free to share the opportunity widely with your networks.

771,2019-06-17 23:57:37,c1v3qu,5,6,"Hi I'm new to Reddit so I'm really sorry if I'm doing this wrong but I need to let this all out. I'm a mess haha.  


Born female. Have always felt for a long time I would be better off a male. Kind of realizing now that I just don’t “fit” into the female box and I am vehemently denying it and am considering surgery to appear more feminine, but also am apprehensive in case I actually want to transition down the road to male. I go through phases where I wanna be super feminine and attractive so I can fit in to society better. Other times, I am okay with being somewhat androgynous, but would prefer being more conventionally attractive. Other times, I just wanna be a full-blown hunky dude, and I’m already half way there so I might as well embrace it.  
 

I experience dysphoria in weird ways, which makes me feel invalid compared to most people. Like I don’t look at my tits in the mirror and want to cry. My body isn’t super feminine to begin with so maybe that’s why? (Broad shoulders, narrow hips, wide rib cage, muscular). But whenever I see a picture of a trans man I just kinda burst into tears, as if I’m looking at what I’m meant to be. That said, I am super apprehensive to start any sort of hormones because I already have a lot of anger issues, and I am scared of what may happen. I’ve heard horror stories of being on T and just being super angry for no reason.  
   
 I’d also like to mention, I still have a lot of feminine interests and am not sure if that would be at odds with my male identity, were I to transition. Y’know, baking, cute stuff, decorating, that sort of thing. But other than that, my interests, mannerisms, and general demeanor can be categorized as “male”. I mostly hang out with guys and feel extremely uncomfortable around girls, because I can’t really relate to them. I often have fantasies of being like my male friends and blending in with them. I virtually fail in all aspects of trying to be feminine, and whenever I try to be (like putting on makeup, trying to dress cute, etc) I feel like an imposter. But also wearing more masculine clothing just makes me feel like a stereotype.   
 

The societal pressure of needing to be attractive and fit into the female box has been killing me for years and it’s finally coming to a head and I just really want to burst out of it. I’m also too stuck in thinking in binaries and assigning different interests or behaviors to genders, just because of how our society works. I want to come out as NB and try to “own it”, but am too afraid of standing out too much or being stereotyped as “confused” or “attack helicopter” or whatever else people say about NB people. Being bullied for most of my life and having extreme social anxiety and agoraphobia will do that to you I guess. I also don’t really go by any special pronouns, for that reason. Even though I feel like I should.  
 

I am scared and confused and don’t know what I am and I feel like I’m not valid enough to be considered trans or non binary haha help me.

799,2019-06-18 16:48:07,c24lop,10,5,"For so long, I've struggled with my gender identity, and I've never found anything that I truly identify with. I always have this feeling of being stuck in the middle, this particular mix of masculine and feminine, and I  have been at odds with my gender because of this. I say that I am a ""futch"" or soft butch to try and explain how I feel, but at times, those don't feel right either. So, it makes me wonder if I am non-binary or not.

As a child, I did do a lot of traditionally feminine things. I wore dresses, played with dolls, and things of that nature. But, around the age of nine, I started growing breasts and during a talk with my mother, I cried about it. I hated the idea of growing breasts and wearing bras. I also intensely hated the pubic hair growing between my legs and shaved it off, in secret, stealing the razor from my dad. After a bit I got used to the fact, and moved on, figuring it was just a part of life. When I got to my teens years, another revelation became apparent, and I learned I wasn't straight. I identified as bisexual at first, and came out as lesbian in my twenties. All the while, I struggled with gender. I felt so much confusion and maybe denial. I wrote it off as a queer thing, but it still loomed over my head and still left more questions than answers, like something wasn't complete. Now, at age thirty-five, I feel like I can't write it off any more. I just really want to figure myself out.

As said before, I feel stuck in the middle. I don't feel feminine enough when it comes to feminine straight women and femme lesbians and I don't feel masculine enough to be hard butch. I know with butch lesbian friends, and a late friend who was a straight tomboy, they were far more masculine than me. Same goes for feminine women in my life. I feel like I can't relate, that their experiences are so foreign to me. I feel so alone in this regard, and I feel sort of like an outcast, always outside looking in. 

On the inside, I do feel this mix of both, and it shows itself in different ways and at different times. The first time I ever wore a shirt and tie, -was one of the very few times I ever felt beautiful. Leather jackets and Chucks are a part of my fashion bible. On the hand, I love painting my nails, coloring my hair and wearing floral perfume. My ideal outfit would be a stylish three-piece suit with little feminine details. I'm a writer, and when I write male characters, I feel such a sense of freedom, and I almost live vicariously through it, but in my non-writing life, I do love being in women's spaces and that feeling is warm and renewing. When it comes to gender, I relate to figures like David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, and Anne Lister. Another thing I really relate to, is actually the show ""Steven Universe."" It's especially with the Gems themselves. I loved seeing Pearl in a tux, given that she's normally one of the more feminine Gems, and seeing Garnet in her wedding dress that was a mash-up of a  traditional wedding dress and tux really inspired me. These things really do speak to me and have been something to relate to. These things are the rare occasion where I see myself.

The biggest reason I tried my best to push away my gender problems is because I do identify as a lesbian. I love being a lesbian, and I do love being a part of the WLW community. I always had this feeling that if my gender was different, I would lose that, and I don't want that. It's the one thing in my life that I am the most sure about. I'm a person that questions myself often and try my best to realize certain things about myself. I like self-discovery.

Now, the one thing I do know, is that I am not trans. I have no real desire to be a man, and even if I did, I couldn't transition. I'm not allowed hormones due to being a cancer patient. I did try packing once, as a personal experiment, and I didn't like it. So, I at least know that much.

My child has come out to me as non-binary. They are nine years old. They have opted not to tell their father (we are divorced) or my male significant other and are comfortable with both female and neutral pronouns.

I am feeling extremely proud that my child felt confident enough to come out to me. I asked them if there were any other changes they would like to make such as cutting their hair, going by a different name, etc. They expressed that they feel comfortable with their appearance and name, so we're good there. A few months ago, they expressed their desire to wear masculine/neutral clothing styles, so we had already updated their wardrobe with their preferred styles.

Is there anything else I can do for my child right now? I ordered an NB pride flag for them to hang in their bedroom. We just moved to a big house and they now have their own room and don't have to share with their little brother. :)

T would greatly improve most of my dysphoria, but I'm not to keen on bottom growth...

(Warning. Some sexual content)

I have done a lot of research, but I feel discussion in regards to bottom growth is so minimal and I dont understand what to expect, especially when I'm considering low-dose and temporary T. I'm alright with some growth, but from what I hear it changes pleasure and the big O is a little different, which concerns me a lot. I also have minimal to no dysphoria for my bottom area. At least, what I have I'm content with. In an ideal world what I have would be different, but bottom growth I feel would inadvertently make me discontent with that area in the extreme case. I just want to be careful about my decision.

Because I'm already very androgynous thanks to genetics, I only want to low dose and do so temporarily enough to grow my facial hair (I already am hairy and pretty certain my genetics will grant this wish), deepen my voice, redistribute the fat in my face, manipulate my muscle mass, etc... I know the outcome depends on genetics, but is low-dose, temporary T as extreme? How much would I expect to change pleasure and orgasm wise? How much physically is expected to change/grow? I know that is based on genetics, but I'm specifically asking how much does low dose effect growth compared to full dose and constant use?

I am very content with basically everything belly button and bellow, it is my torso and face(upper half in general) that causes discontent. I am worried altering anything belly button and below will inadvertently cause dysphoria there. At the same time, however, that could be a sacrifice I'm willing to make considering ever since I faced my dysphoria...

[Live version.](https://youtu.be/Ls7FEAZznCo)

---
Andrew

When I was a kid I would sometimes secretly call myself Andrew,
would tug at the crotch of my pants the way only pubescent boys do,
ran around pounding on my bare chest like Tarzan.
It's not that I thought I'd grow up to be a man;
I just never thought I'd grow up to be a woman either.
From what I could tell neither of those categories seemed to fit me.
But believe me, I knew from a very young age never to say,
“Hey dad, this Adam and Eve thing isn't really working for me;
I mean, what about all the people in between?”

In the third grade Lynette Lyons asked me where all of my Barbies were.
I lied and told her I got in trouble so my mom took them away.
I didn't dare say, “Barbie sucks, Lynette!
And for that matter Tommy, so does GI Joe.”
I wanna grow into something none of us have ever seen before.
And gender is just one of the ways we're boxed in and labeled
before we're ever able to speak who we believe we are
or who we dream we'll become.
Like drumbeats forever changing their rhythm
I am living today as someone I had not yet become yesterday
and tonight I will borrow only pieces of who I am today
to carry with me to tomorrow.
No, I'm not gay.
No, I'm not straight.
And I'm sure as hell not bisexual, damn it.
I am whoever I am when I am it,
loving whoever you are when the stars shine
and whoever you'll be when the sun rises.
Yes, I like girls.
Yes, I like boys.
Yes, I like boys who like boys.
I like girls who wear toys and girls who don't,
girls who don't call themselves girls,
crew cuts or curls or that really bad hair phase in between

I like steam rising from the body of a one-night stand.
I like holding hands for three months before kissing.
I like wishing your body was Saturn,
my body a thousand rings wrapped around you.
You wanted to be a Buddhist nun once.
Last night you held my cervix between your fingers.
I thanked gods I don't believe in for your changing.

Tell me we'll be naming our children beautiful and nothing else.
Tell Barbie she can go now.
Tell GI Joe to put his gun down and find a boyfriend,
or a girlfriend,
or a girl/boyfriend.
fuck it, GI Joe just needs a friend, y'all.
I mean, he's plastic,
and not even the kind of plastic that bends.
I want to bend in a thousand directions,
like the sun does,
like love does,
like time stopped
so the hands of the clock could hold each other.

And we held each other like I held these words
for too many years on the tip of my tongue.
I am my mother's daughter.
I am midnight's sun.
You can find me on the moon
waxing and waning,
my heart full of petals,
every single one begging:
love me, love me, love me,
whoever I am,
whoever I become,
love me, love me, love me. ",NonBinary,Andrew by Andrea Gibson,1560983374.0,"{'created_utc': 1560958174, 'id': 'c2ihbx', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Andrea Gibson is an amazing (slam) poet and I thought I'd share this wonderful poem with y'all.\n[Live version.](https://youtu.be/Ls7FEAZznCo)\n\n---\nAndrew\n\nWhen I was a kid I would sometimes secretly call myself Andrew,\nwould tug at the crotch of my pants the way only pubescent boys do,\nran around pounding on my bare chest like Tarzan.\nIt's not that I thought I'd grow up to be a man;\nI just never thought I'd grow up to be a woman either.\nFrom what I could tell neither of those categories seemed to fit me.\nBut believe me, I knew from a very young age never to say,\n“Hey dad, this Adam and Eve thing isn't really working for me;\nI mean, what about all the people in between?”\n\nIn the third grade Lynette Lyons asked me where all of my Barbies were.\nI lied and told her I got in trouble so my mom took them away.\nI didn't dare say, “Barbie sucks, Lynette!\nAnd for that matter Tommy, so does GI Joe.”\nI wanna grow into something none of us have ever seen before.\nAnd gender is just one of the ways we're boxed in and labeled\nbefore we're ever able to speak who we believe we are\nor who we dream we'll become.\nLike drumbeats forever changing their rhythm\nI am living today as someone I had not yet become yesterday\nand tonight I will borrow only pieces of who I am today\nto carry with me to tomorrow.\nNo, I'm not gay.\nNo, I'm not straight.\nAnd I'm sure as hell not bisexual, damn it.\nI am whoever I am when I am it,\nloving whoever you are when the stars shine\nand whoever you'll be when the sun rises.\nYes, I like girls.\nYes, I like boys.\nYes, I like boys who like boys.\nI like girls who wear toys and girls who don't,\ngirls who don't call themselves girls,\ncrew cuts or curls or that really bad hair phase in between\n\nI like steam rising from the body of a one-night stand.\nI like holding hands for three months before kissing.\nI like wishing your body was Saturn,\nmy body a thousand rings wrapped around you.\nYou wanted to be a Buddhist nun once.\nLast night you held my cervix between your fingers.\nI thanked gods I don't believe in for your changing.\n\nTell me we'll be naming our children beautiful and nothing else.\nTell Barbie she can go now.\nTell GI Joe to put his gun down and find a boyfriend,\nor a girlfriend,\nor a girl/boyfriend.\nfuck it, GI Joe just needs a friend, y'all.\nI mean, he's plastic,\nand not even the kind of plastic that bends.\nI want to bend in a thousand directions,\nlike the sun does,\nlike love does,\nlike time stopped\nso the hands of the clock could hold each other.\n\nAnd we held each other like I held these words\nfor too many years on the tip of my tongue.\nI am my mother's daughter.\nI am midnight's sun.\nYou can find me on the moon\nwaxing and waning,\nmy heart full of petals,\nevery single one begging:\nlove me, love me, love me,\nwhoever I am,\nwhoever I become,\nlove me, love me, love me.\xa0"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Andrew by Andrea Gibson', 'created': 1560983374.0}"

851,2019-06-19 16:52:01,c2jhbk,0,1,"**First, how much does Bicalutamide increase T by?**  
At doses between 10mg to 200mg, there is anywhere from a 21-73% increase in T regardless, so lets just say there is a 50% average increase in T from bicalutamide.  


**How much androgens(T + DHT) does bicalutamide block?**  
""sufficiently high relative concentrations of bicalutamide (1,000- fold excess) are able to completely prevent activation of the AR by androgens like DHT and testosterone and subsequent [upregulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downregulation_and_upregulation) of the [transcription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_transcription) of androgen-responsive [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) and associated effects.[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-Furr1997-39)[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-FurrTucker1996-20)[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-pmid8717469-40)[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-FiggChau2010-41) At steady-state, relative to the normal adult male range for testosterone levels (300–1,000 ng/dL),[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacology_of_bicalutamide#cite_note-ChappleSteers2011-42) circulating concentrations of bicalutamide at 50 mg/day are roughly 600 to 2,500 times higher and at 150 mg/day around 1,500 to 8,000 times higher than circulating testosterone levels""  


if you do the math then 50mg would reach a 1,000 fold excess for &lt;500ng/dl of testosterone   
and 100mg would reach a 1,000 fold excess for &lt;1000ng/dl of testosterone  
and 150mg would reach a 1,500 fold excess for &lt;1500ng/dl of testosterone   
(this is assuming you are not using something to reduce DHT) aka using bicalutamide by itself  


**What if I am using something to lower DHT? (**[**finasteride**](https://www.hairlosstalk.com/treatments/propecia/)**/dutasteride)**  
lets just assume someone is using dutasteride to reduce their DHT by 95% and assume that there is no DHT in the body, only T.  


Well ""DHT is a [potent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potency_(pharmacology)) [agonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agonist) of the AR, and is in fact the most potent known [endogenous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous) [ligand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand_(biochemistry)) of the receptor. It has an [affinity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_(pharmacology)) (Kd) of 0.25 to 0.5 nM for the human AR, which is about 2- to 3-fold higher than that of [testosterone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testosterone) (Kd = 0.4 to 1.0 nM)""  


So we can be aggressive and assume that the Kd (affinity) of Testosterone: 0.4nM  
and the Kd (affinity) of DHT: 0.25nM.  


So if someone was using dutasteride (or finasteride) then they could use a lower dose of bicalutamide since they are only blocking T. DHT has a 2-3 fold higher binding affinity of testosterone so more bicalutamide is required to block it from the AR if DHT is not being blocked already.  


**I'm on dutasteride, so how much Testosterone does bicalutamide block?**  
well since we don't have to worry about DHT, we have to reapply the math on the affinity of testosterone vs dht to see how much bicalutamide is required to only block T from the AR.  


0.4nM/0.25nM=1.6 as a ratio  


so we do  
500ng/dl\*1.6=800ng/dl  
1000ng/dl\*1.6=1600ng/dl  
1500ng/dl\*1.6=2400ng/dl  


so that means  


50mg bicalutamide blocks - 800ng/dl of testosterone  
100mg bicalutamide blocks - 1,600ng/dl of testosterone  
150mg bicalutamide blocks - 2,400ng/dl of testosterone  


it is important that you do not take an SAA with bicalutamide since it will interfere with the drug (SAA's are partial agonists of the AR)  


if you use tamoxifen then there will be an additional 50% increase in T   
and if you use raloxifene there will be an additional 20% increase in T  


**how I chose my dose of bicalutamide**  
my total testosterone on my last blood test was 913ng/dl.  
so if I take bica my T will go up 50% and raloxifine will also increase my T by 20%  
so 913\*1.7=1552ng/dl  


Im also on dutasteride so I can look at the second chart which shows I can take only 100mg bicalutamide.

Basically I feel like I might be fluid but strictly within the nonbinary spectrum, I know terms like genderfluid, genderflux, fluidflux etc already exist but those terms feel like they don't fully describe how I feel and nonbinary doesn't feel like it fully covers it either.

I guess to be fair part of that is my own assumptions influenced by social media that portrays genderfluid as being all about ""switching between male and female"" and nonbinary as just looking ""skinny androgynous"" but I am also genuinely curious if there are other people that feel the same as me and if there is a term I've not heard of that describe what I'm feeling.

Any help/advice would be massively appreciated! :D",NonBinary,Searching for a term that fits me...,1560991870.0,"{'created_utc': 1560966670, 'id': 'c2k8lu', 'num_comments': 14, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'So I\'ve been questioning my gender for literally years at this point and it\'s always so difficult to be sure about because I\'ve always felt a lot of disconnect from myself due to past trauma etc.\n\nThat being said I was scrolling through this subreddit just now and had a thought of something that I feel might fit me but I don\'t know of a term for.\n\nBasically I feel like I might be fluid but strictly within the nonbinary spectrum, I know terms like genderfluid, genderflux, fluidflux etc already exist but those terms feel like they don\'t fully describe how I feel and nonbinary doesn\'t feel like it fully covers it either.\n\nI guess to be fair part of that is my own assumptions influenced by social media that portrays genderfluid as being all about ""switching between male and female"" and nonbinary as just looking ""skinny androgynous"" but I am also genuinely curious if there are other people that feel the same as me and if there is a term I\'ve not heard of that describe what I\'m feeling.\n\nAny help/advice would be massively appreciated! :D', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Searching for a term that fits me...', 'created': 1560991870.0}"

Non-binary identifying lesbian here.  My wife and I got married last month and it was actually the process of planning our wedding that helped me realize I was NB.  Having binary-gendered norms shoved in your face can be a bit eye opening it turns out.

Anyway, that was about a year ago and I’ve been slowly rolling out using they/them pronouns in my daily life to mixed reactions (naturally).  My workplace, friends, and spouse are all supportive and thats been nice. 

I’ve been having a lot of increased anxiety lately that I’ve just started seeing a therapist for, and I realized today a lot of it seems to be around gender and dysphoria.  I want to try binding, but I’m not a small human, and the boobs I was cursed with aren’t either...on top of that I have some back issues I’m worried about aggravating.  I can’t seem to find any info on binding with an already bad back.  It’s been frustrating. The Therapist I’m seeing is at an LGBT+ clinic so I’m hoping for some direction there.

Anyway I just wanted to kinda reach out and introduce myself in the helps of gaining some sort of community.

Shared my story of how I realized I was gender fluid and nonbinary.\n\nAlso, had more discussions at lunch about gender identity today. One coworker asked me about the name Riley. So, I told him about my plans and desire to change it. He offered to start calling me Riley right then. But, I asked not to until the rest of the team knows. It was so validating hearing him say my name out loud. Hearing both first and last name together sounded so right to me.\n\nSo, as far as work is concerned. My next step is I am waiting for my supervisor to return from vacation. I will then have a talk with her about my name.\n\nThen, I will need to tell my family of my plans. After that, I will begin the legal process. I have decided to make my birthday be the day I start officially asking people to start calling me Riley.

943,2019-06-21 06:25:05,c3736z,5,5,"So I identify as non-binary rather than as genderqueer for the simple reason that conceptualising gender as a multidimensional spectrum makes more sense to how I perceive things, and fits better with NB than GQ. But I love the ideas behind the genderqueer flag and the expression of gender that it presents (lavender being a mix of pink and blue, white being a neutral colour, and green being the inversion of lavender).

This is my first time posting here and I'm a bit nervous, but here we go...I have only recently connected the dots of my past and present experiences and realised I might be non binary. I'm afab and want to try hiding my chest as much as possible as it's always given me dysphoria and I want to try an androgynous look, but I have bad anxiety and at this point binding seems too dangerous for me. I would like to try a sports bra first and am looking for recommendations.

I have seen the Extreme Magicotton Sports and Binding Bra recommended by many people and wanted to ask if it is good. Also, their size chart (here: [https://www.underworks.com/extreme-magicotton-sports-and-binding-bra](https://www.underworks.com/extreme-magicotton-sports-and-binding-bra)) says I should get size 32 since I'm very close to the lowest measurement, but most of my clothes tend to be 34-36 so that might be small. What are people's experiences with this? Should I get a 34 instead?

I've been working on ways to live with the chronic neck and back pain (orthopedist, chiropractor, physical therapy, etc) but it's noticeable and awkward to leave the house without a bra so I've only been out for 2-4 hours at a time in the last year due to the pain.

FTM Cons: Most friends/family don't know I'm NB, awkward conversations.  Allowing my insurance company to know I'm NB, in case of current/future discrimination.

Reduction Pros: Avoiding awkward conversations with friends/family, still visibly 'female' so might be less of a shock to my system and adjustment.  Not allowing my insurance company to know I'm NB.

Reduction Cons: Still feeling painful hormonal changes/swelling, swelling or fat growth in general, may need a bra again eventually as age/gravity happens.

&amp;#x200B;

\----

My hair texture is...unusual, to say the least. Somewhere between 3 and 4 on the Norwood scale, just the receded hairline, no other baldspots. It's very fine and very thin, mostly straight on the scalp. Thick, wavy on the sides. Also the hair from my scalp is extremely slow growing compared to the hair on the sides of my head, often feeling like it hits a 'maximum' length of 5 inches.

Tends towards being very dry. I rarely shampoo it, but condition it several times a week. Usually when i do shampoo it, it is a dry, crispy mess for days.

It's always been a real pain to manage so I've generally just given up and gone with an extremely short cut despite having always wanted long hair.

I actually had it long at one point, but I had no idea how to care for it and it didnt look great. The uneven thickness gave me the 'pyramid' look, among other issues.

Recently, I've been. wanting to try again, and I'm willing to put in however much care into my hair regimen as it needs, I just need some pointers to even know where to begin.

1033,2019-06-23 04:39:28,c3z96m,14,8,"So I would like to get a feel of why non-binary people sometimes transition.  I don’t have a problem with that just it makes me think about my own experience.   

I thought I was meant to be female and wanted to transition for most of my life.   But I never did.   I have always been nonconforming when I could over the years.   

Upon realizing I was gender fluid and non-binary, I finally was able to be comfortable in my body as is.   I wanted to be able to present myself feminine.  And now that I have been doing it more than ever before, I feel right. 

I still would like a female body but I don’t want it by transitioning from a huge male one.  So even if I did, it would not change things that bother me and make me more dysphoric than now.  It would make the things about my body I don’t like stand out to me more.  

So how common is transitioning and non-binary?   What are your motivations for transitioning?

Then the other area I notice is how many people have binary presentations yet are non-binary.  I know there really are not any rules so I get that.  But how do you show that you’re non-binary?

For me I am showing my non-binary gender by doing these things:
- changing name to a gender neutral name
- clothing and accessories, jewelry, and cosmetics 
- not changing my body 

The name is obvious.  But my goal with clothing is to mix masculine and feminine.   My body is masculine so it does not help with anything feminine but limits me to some male clothing because of size limits.   I then use feminine clothing that I can find that fits and stuff to balance it out and bring me to the middle.   

I never understood the androgynous appearance goals because I thought masculine male was too limited and androgynous seems even more limited.   But I am really impressed by those of you that can make yourself look like both male and female at the same time or neither.   My body is too binary for that I think.

I have always been nonconforming when I could over the years.   \n\nUpon realizing I was gender fluid and non-binary, I finally was able to be comfortable in my body as is.   I wanted to be able to present myself feminine.  And now that I have been doing it more than ever before, I feel right. \n\nI still would like a female body but I don’t want it by transitioning from a huge male one.  So even if I did, it would not change things that bother me and make me more dysphoric than now.  It would make the things about my body I don’t like stand out to me more.  \n\nSo how common is transitioning and non-binary?   What are your motivations for transitioning?\n\nThen the other area I notice is how many people have binary presentations yet are non-binary.  I know there really are not any rules so I get that.  But how do you show that you’re non-binary?\n\nFor me I am showing my non-binary gender by doing these things:\n- changing name to a gender neutral name\n- clothing and accessories, jewelry, and cosmetics \n- not changing my body \n\nThe name is obvious.  But my goal with clothing is to mix masculine and feminine.   My body is masculine so it does not help with anything feminine but limits me to some male clothing because of size limits.   I then use feminine clothing that I can find that fits and stuff to balance it out and bring me to the middle.   \n\nI never understood the androgynous appearance goals because I thought masculine male was too limited and androgynous seems even more limited.   But I am really impressed by those of you that can make yourself look like both male and female at the same time or neither.   My body is too binary for that I think.  \n\nOk I think I explained what I am interested in learning about.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Non-binary Transitioning', 'created': 1561289968.0}"

I thought I looked nice, but it was weird. I don't dress super masculine usually and most people wouldn't guess I'm dressing masc at all because I love bright colours and fun patterns but there are certain items of clothing I tend to avoid because I feel really confused in them.

When I was 14 I confessed to my mom that I thought I was nonbinary. This confused and angered her. She has been nothing but accepting of any other identity while I was questioning my sexuality, but this upset her. When I explained the feelings I was having, she brushed them off. I wanted to be more androgynous and go by they/them pronouns. My name is Faith, and I started going by Faye, since it was more gender neutral. Everyone at school called me Faye, but my family refused. I spent so long trying to convince my mom to let me cut my hair. She finally let me, but unfortunately it was one of those awful “let me speak to your manager” haircuts. I just wanted a “boys” haircut. That was all.

So, I pushed down my feelings to appease her. I blamed it on my mental illnesses. I told her I was getting better. I believed it.

It’s just that, something doesn’t feel right. I don’t feel much of a connection to being female at all. I don’t like being called a girl or a woman. I don’t like using she/her as my pronouns. I hate having boobs most of all. Every time I see them I feel sick. I don’t take baths anymore because I just hate seeing them. I’d be fine if they were muscular pecs, but having sacks of fat just make me so uncomfortable.

I’ve bought myself a sports bra and instead of buying revealing, tight fitting shirts, I’ve been buying the next size up in T shirts pretty exclusively. I just looked in the mirror and realized I like how I look. I have a bit more body fat than I’d like and I want to build muscle, but other than that, I’m happy. I like my hair. It’s a feminine cut, but it suits me. My face looks like mine, which I haven’t felt in a while. My body felt right, not having breasts.

So, I’ve thought, am I trans? But no. Being called a boy is almost worse. I don’t want to be called he or him. I’m not a man or a boy. 

So what am I?

I don’t know. I just want to be me. I don’t want to be called male or female. I just want to be me. But I wish I felt female. I call myself a lesbian and I like being a lesbian. But how can I be a lesbian if I’m not female? That’s where it gets me. I want to continue being a lesbian. I don’t necessarily want to not be a woman, I just don’t really want to be referred to as such.

I've used computers since I was a toddler but technology just doesn't agree with me especially the more advanced it gets. I feel like a 90 year old out of touch. So forgive me my questions.

Do u know who chose the colors to represent non binary? What they might stand for? I only know rainbow for lgbt and purple for bis. Is there a color for pans? Are gender fluids lumped together with non binaries?

I'm gender fluid I guess. I consider myself non binary essentially but gender fluid in that I take temporary pleasure in being girly for instance. But then I'm not a ""real"" girl. I'm afab but I've never blended with the females of this world like that. I don't get them. I feel like mentally mixture of boy as and girl. I'm bi/pan but romantic only for boys which leaves me wishing I could be a femme gay boy. That way I could be with boys. I cant as a girl. It doesn't cause me dysphoria to my knowledge to be a girl but it prevents relationships. If a guy looks at me like he wants me because I'm a girl maybe that feeling is dysphoria. It weird me out. Het stuff puts me off so in this body with my preference for boys I'd be forced to be het. I'm a gay boy inside. Andro gay boy who is very girly. Suffice it to say I get confused a lot.

In my case, I'm AMAB and sometimes drift strongly towards feeling like I identify as female. There are other days where I'm completely unsure and resonate with being a man.

When I feel more masculine, I sometimes feel a self hatred towards my own gender confusion.

Is there a good way to tell how I identify and what is just some relapse in terms of rejecting myself?

For context, I grew up in a hyper conservative environment that wouldn't accept me for being even the slightest bit non cis.

Also, is there a term to describe identifying as the gender opposite to your biological sex?

The only way, as what we now call DMAB, to get hormone replacement therapy was to recite 'the official narrative' and appear on paper to hit all the selection criteria as a Transsexual (we didn't even have the word ""Transgender"" yet!

So being that I wanted 'demasculinization', I toed the line, said the words they wanted to hear, and got my little pills that didn't do very much.

23 years later, my breast development is not much to write home about. Small enough that my insurance would actually cover implants in my case, but I've always been a bit on the fence.

What little breast development I've had, has always been a source of self-consciousness. Too much not to wear a bra (my nipples always seem to show under shirts), and too little to really help much in passing for female (and as an overweight person, bras in my cup and band size were always hard to find.. 46B? Not happening). And at the same time, prominent enough that I was always a little embarrassed - if they were bigger, would that feel worse?

Well last November, I got weight-loss surgery (yay!) and I've been dropping clothing sizes. The bras I've had for ages have been getting looser and looser, and I knew it was time to get new ones. My counselor at the bariatric center suggested I pick up a couple of sports bras, since they're stretchy, I could probably wear a snug one now, that would still fit as I lost some more weight down the line.

So I ordered the best reviewed and cheapest option on Amazon. About $8 each for 2. They're not quite as durably made as the ones I'd had for years, but if these last til I shrink out of them, then fine.

They're snug. Not tight, not painful or anything. But they're a bit like I suspect a light-duty binder might feel. And.. yeah, looking down, they smoosh my boobs in a bit flat.

A bit more than a bit, actually.

I.. I had no idea I would love this as much as I do. It's not so-so-so much that I'm flat-flat or anything.. but I feel.. better about myself.

1391,2019-06-29 20:56:44,c74htk,7,17,"Curious of anyone can relate cause I’ve struggled with this confusion since puberty and it hit me again this weekend.

So I’m AFAB. My feeling/presentation can fluctuate from full female, to androgynous, to bigendered, to full male. I’ll dress, act, feel and respond within whichever of those four I’m in. Phases last days, to weeks, to months. The full male one includes pretty strong body dysphoria. As a teenager my brain starting telling me I had male equipment down there but I don’t. It felt like a phantom limb. And in my dreams I’d be completely a dude, only to wake up and find I didn’t have all my body parts and did have other parts...

Anyway, most of the time for the last few years I’ve felt bigendered/genderfluid where I can integrate what my brain says should be there with what is actually there. I also feel my monthly cycle sort of superimposes female feelings and experiences over/on top of my male brain. Then last year I had a baby and that whole experience was SO feminine and all female but now that has worn off and I’m back to my genderfluid/bigendered integration of brain (dude) and body (lady).

So here is what always confuses me: whenever I feel full female, I’ll wear a cute skirt and a cute top and my body language follows suit. It happens maybe once a year for a few days or weeks. But everyone responds SO positively. People go out of their way to say nice things about my looks. They counsel me to not be too ‘insecure to wear a skirt’, and basically start a whole campaign that I should do this more often. The social validation is overwhelming and confusing. Then when I go back to my normal NB ways.... I get nothing. I like my ‘regular’ style. I love it, really. 

But no one else does. And that BOTHERS me... I wish people could be as excited or positive about my most-days, integrated boy/girl me as when I just conform to the sex I was born with...

Then last year I had a baby and that whole experience was SO feminine and all female but now that has worn off and I’m back to my genderfluid/bigendered integration of brain (dude) and body (lady).\n\nSo here is what always confuses me: whenever I feel full female, I’ll wear a cute skirt and a cute top and my body language follows suit. It happens maybe once a year for a few days or weeks. But everyone responds SO positively. People go out of their way to say nice things about my looks. They counsel me to not be too ‘insecure to wear a skirt’, and basically start a whole campaign that I should do this more often. The social validation is overwhelming and confusing. Then when I go back to my normal NB ways.... I get nothing. I like my ‘regular’ style. I love it, really. \n\nBut no one else does. And that BOTHERS me... I wish people could be as excited or positive about my most-days, integrated boy/girl me as when I just conform to the sex I was born with...\n\nAnyone recognize these feelings?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Wishing people would appreciate NB side as much as my short gender conforming periods....', 'created': 1561867004.0}"

1403,2019-06-30 01:58:26,c77my3,8,7,"Hey everyone,

So, I just need to talk about this to maybe help me feel better.

I've identified as Agender (or rather just having a lack of any label and just being ""me"" (any pronouns)) since I was 18 (currently 22) and I thought that was going to be it, I thought I found my path. A few days ago these thoughts just came into my head saying -

""Why don't you go back to just saying you're a female?""

""You're a fake, you did this because you think it's cool"" 

\- and stuff like that.

Now I did have these thoughts before through the years once or twice but they didn't stay like they're staying now. 

I've never experienced any dysphoria with my gender or body, I just kind of found out that I like to identify this way and it makes me comfortable. I noticed I never felt entirely female, like it's just something I'm called and respond to because I'm used to it. I know I've never felt male either and thinking about the gender binary to the point where it doesn't mean anything, I no longer cared enough to be part of it. This makes me feel like I chose this instead of it being something I had to find out to help me be a better truer me. It makes me feel like a total fraud and that's the last thing I want to be with myself and the people around me.

I gave myself an out loud talk in the mirror, saying different genders and trying to be as honest as possible. Everything else I said besides saying ""I'm just me"" made me feel like a tiny brick wall formed inside so, I'm like ""No, of course you still feel the same as before this is silly."" 

But, I just have a lot of self doubt and anxiety over every little thing so...

Does anyone else ever experience anything like this?

Does anyone have similar feelings about their gender/their gender discovery?

Am I valid to have these feelings and still identify as I am or should I question myself more?

And then the great big cherry on top was hearing another friend at the table talking about his trans guy friend and calling him 'she' over and over again.

I grew up in a very Catholic conservative area, so I guess that sort of thing was ‘taught’ to me. I was that typical anti always preaching ‘being gay is whatever but don’t shove it down my throat’, ‘homophobia doesn’t even exist’, and ‘LGBT  believes in 76 genders!!1!’

Then I found out I was bi and realized a lot of my previous reasoning and thinking was just inconsiderate and generalizing. I was just uneducated on basically everything and was repeating what I’d heard others saying.

Lately I’ve been trying to educate myself more on these things so I don’t ever end up how I used to be. Lately I’ve been hearing a lot about non-binary, but I’ve never once met a person like that so I’ve come here to try and learn more. 

So here are my questions! Feel free to answer which ever you like or all of them, anything at all is extremely appreciated!!

-Is non-binary a third gender? 
-What exactly is non-binary and are there requirements to be nb? 
-How did you know you were non-binary? 
-How does someone else know if they are or aren’t non-binary?
-Can non-binary people be lesbians/gay?
-Is there a term for non-binary people who only are attracted to other non-binary people, or is there a term for non-binary people attracted to non-binary and women or men?
-Do non-binary people experience dysphoria? If so, is it anything like the dysphoria trans men and women experience?
-How long has non-binary been a thing/ been around?
-Do non-binary transition? If so, to what extent?

I was that typical anti always preaching ‘being gay is whatever but don’t shove it down my throat’, ‘homophobia doesn’t even exist’, and ‘LGBT  believes in 76 genders!!1!’\n\nThen I found out I was bi and realized a lot of my previous reasoning and thinking was just inconsiderate and generalizing. I was just uneducated on basically everything and was repeating what I’d heard others saying.\n\nLately I’ve been trying to educate myself more on these things so I don’t ever end up how I used to be.

32,2019-06-01 20:06:28,bvoxcm,0,3,"Last Saturday I went to an weekend outdoor event that I have attended for a long time. I couldn't go for the whole weekend, so one of the main things on my list was to visit two friends of mine, a couple who attend every year from out of town. I'm going to call them Kat and Chaz.

I felt I owed them some time, but I also wanted to tell them that I'd started HRT, because I might not see them again for several months and I didn't want to spring the changes on them the next time I see them.

There was some revelry going on, and Chaz is a charismatic ringleader, so he was more busy running things. But, as is common for guys, he's also a little bit shyer when talking about personal things. Consequently, I ended up mostly talking to Kat. I'm still getting to know her, but she's sweet.

So I got the chance to come out to them, and they assured me that they're quite accepting. I thanked them but said that I hadn't been worried; I just didn't want to alarm them next time I see them if I've changed a lot.

It all went quite well and led to a nice discussion with Kat. She had already known that I was non-binary as of last year, but she said that during that time, she strongly suspected that I was going to transition just by reading my Facebook posts. Not so much diary-style entries, but rather the stories I chose to reshare — frequently stories about gender and LGBTQIA equality with an emphasis on the T. :)

Now, Kat and Chaz are very empathetic and intuitive people, which is part of why they're popular at this event. But even so, I felt validated that they had already anticipated my feelings. In trans subs we joke a lot about dropping blatant hints to clueless cis people, but they aren't *always* clueless about it. 😊

I definitely hope other attempts to come out to people go as well. In particular I have one old high school friend, a fairly awkward dude, that I still need to come out to. I've known him a long time and haven't told him about HRT, but he doesn't even know that I'm non-binary yet. 🙁",trans,Validation from seeing old friends at an event,1559444788.0,"{'created_utc': 1559419588, 'id': 'bvoxcm', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""Last Saturday I went to an weekend outdoor event that I have attended for a long time.

This is probably a really common question, but how can I be sure I'm trans? I'm biologically male but have in the past and sometimes still do, wanted to be a woman. Last year I bought some girl clothes and makeup and such and dressed up some in private and it felt nice, especially showing off some lol. But after a week or two of wearing girl clothes in private, and even panties under my guy clothes in public, I decided it wasn't really for me. At the time at least, I decided I couldn't really see it as a longterm thing, but I'm still not sure. Now I'm starting to feel the urge again. How do I know if I don't just enjoy the fantasy or if I really want to be a girl? I know I'm for sure at least bi, I've had sex with men multiple times already, but how can I be sure whether or not I want to be a girl or if it's just a fantasy thing? I guess one thing that's stopping me so far for sure is that my parents and grandparents wouldn't approve. I know my parents would still love me, but I've heard them say some messed up stuff about trans people before, and it kinda scared me away from it I guess. Like I feel like I couldn't ever come out to them or they'd be ashamed or something. I know if my grandparents ever found out they'd disown me for even ever being with a guy. I know my sister wouldn't mind, and probably wouldn't be very surprised, but besides her idk. I'm just really unsure as I'm sure a lot of people like me have been or still are. Sometimes I enjoy feeling manly, but then other times I enjoy feeling really fem. Like the other day me and my sister were at the store and I was wearing these like short biking shorts and I felt really cute and fem for some reason. I even pulled them up a little cause at the time at least I wasn't afraid. I saw a couple cute guys walk past and that made me feel even more that way. I'm just so unsure though, it feels like a really big commitment to consider myself actually trans and not just bi/gay, I guess since I would dress and all that, eventually in public. I feel like the big thing for me would be whether or not I could see myself falling in love with a guy. Maybe that's how I should try to judge it. Pretty much anytime I've spent with a guy sexually in the past hasn't lasted more than a time or two of seeing them so I feel like I haven't really had a chance to find out. Any advice?

I shaved with scissors for years because having facial hair felt like... it wasn’t right, it would go away soon and I didn’t want my parents to know. They reminded me that I’d have to start shaving soon on a regular basis and I hated it, but could never explain why. They finally bought me a razor and I went in my room and cried (still haven’t opened it years later). A little less than a year ago I started to question my gender identity, but coming out is a huge leap and I don’t know if I’m ready for that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t know if this means anything, but I also envy women’s clothes and want to try on a dress soon. I also get along with my female friends better than my male friends. I always feel like I have to hide something about myself to get my my male friends to like me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another fact about being transgender that shocked me is that \~45% of transgender people have attempted suicide. I don’t think I’d ever take my own life because I feel trapped in the wrong body. A lot of people have said that “trapped in the wrong body” and I don’t feel like that all the time.

I sit across from her at the table. She's very attractive, almost stunningly so. Her lipstick is thickly applied but makes her lips pop, and the smile they form is a comforting aspect in a myriad of reluctantly unnerving circumstances. Her dress looks well cut and straightened out, and while a little revealing it remains tasteful. She took time and care into making herself look presentable for this date. Presentable for me. Frankly, I'm flattered, red in the face, a flush of blush fills my cheeks and her smile grows. She 
chuckles a bit at my nervousness but I'm just absolutely stunned by how beautiful the woman sitting across from me is.

I don't want her or others like her to hate me. I wish that wouldn't be the case but I see it happening. It's difficult to think about sometimes. I'm a straight dude, a man who is attracted to women, and I can't say with a clean conscious “nothing more, nothing less.”  Because that isn't very clear to me honestly. I don't know what else to call it but fear. My feelings towards her are strange, because my natural instincts tell me that this is off, maybe even as far as wrong but she hates to think of it as so. I'd hate to make her feel that way, I could only imagine her discomfort at the expense of my words, yet I feel great discomfort in her simply existing and doing her own thing. I can't shake that this sentiment is wrong and I shouldn't feel as such, not just about her but anybody like her.

I’m super scared about coming out to my family. They could go literally either way if I come out, I have no idea. My sister was cornered into coming out as bi and my parents didn’t super like that, saying she was confused and stuff like that. I’ve overheard conversations where they say pretty homophobic stuff. If they don’t agree with LGB issues, I can only see it being worse with T issues.

I can’t work due to mental illness and am currently applying for income assistance so I can live on my own, but that can take between 6 months to over a year so in the meantime I live with my parents, i.e. I depend on them fully for food, shelter, and money for costs like insurance/cell phone/gas.

Even if they allow me to live at home still, what if they stop paying for my cell phone? I’m housebound most days. I would hate to lose my primary contact with the outside world.

If I wait until my income assistance application goes through to transition (6 months to over a year.....), I’m faced with the choice to come out then or cut off my family all together. Neither is a bad option in my opinion, most of my family is pretty conservative but there are a few good eggs I’d hate to lose. I can’t exactly pick and choose if I’m physically going to change. And that’s IF I can even afford transitioning. I live in BC, Canada, so it won’t be as expensive as the states I think but income assistance won’t exactly throw thousands of dollars my way. 

Is it smarter to hold off, even though I want to start transitioning asap? My family isn’t the most tight-knit, but they’ve been good, so is it wrong to cut them off? What if I need financial help?

196,2019-06-05 04:34:49,bwyksv,1,2,"Hi.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if my explanation doesn't make sense or is confusing. I'm not sure what I should mention in terms of what I'm having issues with. I feel like it could be multiple things and I could be leaving out something that could be important to the question I'm asking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a girl and looking back on my life, I'm starting to see that I've been very uncomfortable as one. It was hard to make friends online because I played a lot of games that were played mostly by males and when I would make a friend, they would treat me differently if they knew I was a girl. A lot of the time after these things would happen I would deliberately go out of my way to never mention my gender because I was scared that they would act weird towards me if they knew I was one. Sometimes people would ask me out or creep on me within a day of knowing me. It felt bad because these people would make friends perfectly fine with people of the same gender but they would treat me weird and get mad at me if I didn't reciprocate even if I barely knew them. I also couldn't join team voice chats or talk in games very much because I'm scared and I have a weird sounding voice. One time, someone went into a lot of graphic detail about what they would do to me because I was doing bad in an online game and another time one of the best friends I had called me and asked me a lot of weird questions and kept pushing so that I would answer them (such as my bra size). I've had a lot of bad experiences with this sort of stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from that, I've always had a kind of ""masculine"" way of expressing myself, if that makes sense. I like to wear suits, I don't really wear dresses and I love having short hair. I've worn boys clothes before and it made me happy to wear them for some reason. I've also had periods where I was really into dresses and makeup but they burned out kinda fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like playing a girl in video games or tabletops either. I feel really.. odd? when I'm addressed as a girl. In fact, I feel kinda disappointed when I am. I'm in a women's gaming group and I enjoy being in it, but I feel kind of out of place, especially when I'm referred to with any feminine nicknames. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried thinking about this a lot. Sometimes I think, ""yeah for sure I'm trans."" and other times I think ""no way I'm trans, I'm a girl."" I'm really confused and I'm having a lot of trouble.

some brief personal history. i was raised by my mum along with 4 half siblings, (each different dads , all our dads are/were crappy) anyway, my biological father was in and out of my life until i was 8, where he kinda went his own way and maybe once a year i was in contact with him,   


before he went away he had a child with his then gf , and that was that, i grew up not knowing her (he was born female so i will use ""her/she"" for past tense before he came out) i met her once when she was 5 randomly bumping into her and my dad in a store , i was a very depressed/nervous preteen so i did minimal small talk before running out and avoiding them but anyway.   


last year my ""dad"" got in contact with me via FB and we briefly talked about my sister and (will now use he) my dad told me my now brother came out at the age of 8, i also got to briefly talk to him and it was nice, he looks way more happier than when i met him when he was 5., at this point in time i wasnt out of the closet and hearing that he was trans really boosted me to come out also so i did .  


okay sorry for that ramble  


what are the chances of it, both of my dads children being trans, and my brother being ftm and me being mtf, its almost like we swapped,  


my dad still has not read the message i sent of me coming out, after he told me about my brother he seemed to disappear off facebook and i cant find him, so whenever he does go online hes gonna have a shock,  


also just to state, im turning 21 in a week and i believe my brother is 12/13 , im not sure of his birth-year

Non binary and gender fluid identities,


Why pronouns are important,


He/him lesbians and she/her gays,


Trans people being apart of the LGBT community,

I am getting depressed from heavy porn use, I watch and masturbate every night. I have stayed away from porn for almost 2 weeks now. I was reminded that my fascination with make up started before i discovered porn.

I am experimenting on my feelings but it seems that. I really enjoy the cross-dressing, how i look, the rush. I can stay dressed up as long i want but when i take it all of it feels so dysphoric.

I must penetrate myself with toys while caged and orgasm just to have a satisfying feeling. but still it feel dysphoric when i take off my make up wig and clothes.

I went as far as taking videos of myself and uploading it in porn sites. And i am liking the attention i am getting. It just gives me more excited but after orgasm, I deleted the videos.

I don't even know how to explain or write this down. I write here with full respect and I am not trying to offend anybody.

&amp;#x200B;

I met girl few weeks ago in a pub.

I knew She is a trans but I was like I should try everything in my life. So I did. 

We were drinking, kissing, huging. It was nice. 

I met her next weekend the same thing happened but this time We ended up in my room. After the thing I realised that I am not really attracted to man's genitals and that I am straight.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to set my relationship with her so We are just friends. I just do not know how to do it without offending her.

She is very nice person. 

Could you please help me ?

&amp;#x200B;

My name is Toni, I use he/him and identify as genderqueer. I am seeking help with a project I am working on.

&amp;#x200B;

I have decided to start an Instagram account called ""Another Day, Another Gender"". The goals of the project are to promote acceptance of gender diversity and expression, push back against gatekeeping and toxic ideals of appearance, and celebrate queer fashion.  

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I'd like this to be a submission-based account that has a daily feature post about an individual's gender presentation. The preferred format would look something like:

&amp;#x200B;

\[Image\]

Today's Gender is ""\[Description\]"". Thanks to \[name\] for the submission!

&amp;#x200B;

Examples I have done on my personal account include snarky descriptions, like ""TechnoBabe"" or ""Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun"". That kind of lighthearted, semi-dramatic attitude is what I am aiming for with this project. I think that too often, it feels like the conversations that happen in the community are very negative: about our dysphoria or the rate at which we suffer injustices, and I want to add some fun, positivity, and celebration to the dialogue. 

&amp;#x200B;

If you would be interested in following a project like this, please give an upvote and leave your thoughts in the comments. If you have submissions, feel free to DM the account at ""another\_day\_another\_gender"" with your picture and a clever description of your aesthetic for that day.

Okay, my friend just came out to me this morning (ftm). I already switched his ""nickname"" on fb messenger and in my contacts to the name he chose, I told him that I love and support him and that I'm happy for him, and I told him to not hesitate to correct me if I say something wrong. I know every situation is unique, but is there anything in general that I can do to make things easier/better for him? I don't believe he's going to get any support from his family. 

A few years ago, he told me he was genderfluid and started binding and packing some days, so I did some research on those topics, as well as top surgery in case the need ever arose. Are there any other topics I should educate myself on? I'd like to know as much as possible so I won't have to ask him a million questions like everyone else as he transitions.

Okay, so. I've been dating this guy for about 4 years now after meeting online. I know I know, go ahead and come for me about the whole ""catfish"" thing but we video chat every chance we get and I basically know every hair on his head. However- I've recently become a little curious about his life outside of ""our life"", if that makes sense? And since we have yet to physically meet, as he's always a bit apprehensive, I decided to do some ""digging"", if you will, on the good ole interwebs. He's always claimed to have no social media, so this seemingly posed an issue in my ""digging"". But, awhile back I had discovered his Mom's Facebook page. So I decided to take another look, as it had been awhile, and look through her friends list to see if maybe he just wasn't comfortable sharing if he had in fact had an account. What do ya know, I find an account with a name incredibly similar to his name- but twisted to a typically ""female"" name. So I click. And it's him. One of the baby pictures that he's showed me before is his profile picture. And so I scroll through the 4 photos that are available to look at and there's a picture of him at prom from 2015..in an evening gown..with makeup and straightened hair and BOOBS, like actual, physical, fleshy tetas. Now, I really don't want this post to come off as awful. And even though I'm almost positive that I'll screw up on being correct with my wording, I desperately need advice so I'm going to continue and hopefully if I get any responses \*crosses fingers and toes\*, maybe you could include any corrections if necessary? Please, educate ya girl. Okay, back to our story. This picture wouldn't have ""shocked"" me in any other scenario, but this guy has always identified himself to me as a cis male.  Here's my dilemma- my first priority with going forward is continuing to be respectful. I'm not sure why he has chosen to not fill me in on this part of his life, and hey maybe he just genuinely feels it isn't necessary information to know (which I actually really understand and agree with if that's the case). But, I'm so confused: do I bring this up with him? I mean, if I were to talk about it, how do I even begin to explain the situation to him? But, on the other hand, should I not bring this up with him? If he's chosen to leave this information out of our relationship for whatever reason, do I really want to break the respect that we've created with one another by bringing this up? But then again, am I losing a bit of self respect by not sharing with him?   


I think I also need to clarify something- finding out this information changes nothing for me. I still love him, or them or her or whomever they identify as, just the same. I still want to continue our relationship together, continue our little life together, regardless of this new information.  


I'm literally so confused as to what to do. Like I said, my first priority is to continue to be respectful to him and the way that he's identified himself to be and how he's created this relationship with me. And don't get me wrong, I know I dipped my hand in the cookie jar when I was told not to- but now that I've got this cookie..what do I do with it?  


Please, oh please, if you have any advice or words or wisdom that I can consider for this situation, I'd literally be forever in your debt. I'm doing my best to be educated and respectful toward this dilemma, but I need help going forward.

We found out he was gay in 2009. It was certainly a shock at the time because there was no inkling of him being gay. He was married with kids, alpha male, type A personality. If you’re gay, you’re gay. Certainly no one’s place to judge. Though gay aside, he was a huge asshole and no one liked him. Extremely cunning, manipulative and intelligent to the point it got him in trouble. But that’s besides the point.

A few years after we learned he was gay(I’m actually the one who found out), my other brother confessed to my mom and I that he was sexually abused by said brother when they were 17 and 12 respectively. This we learned I believe it was in 2011. We were obviously disgusted and appalled but simultaneously, not surprised it happened.

As far as our dealings with said brother, here’s how it’s gone down. Me- I cut him off when I found out he sexually abused my other brother(this would’ve been 2011, maybe 2012). Mom- last spoke to him about a year ago. Sister- not sure. Dad- brother hits him up whenever he needs something but last time they saw each other was Thanksgiving 2002.

Fast forward to last night. Mom calls me and sends me a picture from Facebook. It’s a picture of a well built woman with two extremely hideous paw print tattoos right above each tit. I tell her what I see and she tells me to look closer. I don’t understand where she’s going with it. She tells me to guess who it is. I correctly guessed my oldest brother. Now my brother is 6’7” 260 lbs so he stood out even as a masculine alpha male. Now as a woman, she’ll stand out even more.

As far as LGBT, I won’t pretend to know what it’s like to be any of the four because I don’t fall under any of them and don’t know what it’s like to struggle with orientation. And it’s certainly not my place to judge someone who is. The fact is before the transition, my brother was an asshole to say the very least, not to mention a sexual predator and coming to terms even with that was extremely difficult despite it not happening to me. Now that my brother is now a transgender woman(and obviously my sister now), I’m finding this even harder to deal with than learning he was a gay man or a pedophile.

I thought that was really insightful. 

Just this past weekend I finally came out to my family (the only people I have talked to so far), and luckily for me I have an amazing family. My parents have always said that they just want my brother and I to be happy, and they showed that. Actually, they're a little too supportive because I'm still not really comfortable with who I am, and they're apparently more happy than I am about this.

How about counselling? Have you looked into hrt? There's a place near you that hosts workshops that might help you adjust"". Too much! I wonder how many people have been so fortunate as to have to tell their parents to slow down on the transition train, definitely too few. 

Funny thing is, I'm still terrified of telling my friends of 20 years. Needless to say, having stayed a group since kindergarten, we're pretty close. And yet, it's terrifying to talk to them about this. Coming out at work will be similarly difficult. Even once everyone knows, you're still changing; still coming out. It's a weird thing to me.

Luckily even without hrt I've managed to pass in the past so I'm sure my path will be relatively smooth in that regard. Unfortunately, however, I have cripplingly low self-confidence so I struggle to do a lot of things.

373,2019-06-09 12:14:34,byjmi2,2,16,"Okkkieeeee. Is it just me?

I feel like my parents, siblings, and friends think I’m always gonna be read as trans by others (I don’t mind visibility I live in a very safe environment and gender bending is kinda cool and artsy over here).

Sample conversation with my mom:

– Hey dear, I was wondering if you’d like to go to the marshmallow gnome festival this weekend. They have free smores!

– No mom, I really don’t like smores.

– C’mon darling! They are very accepting you know!

– I don’t care, I just don’t like gnomes trying to sell me marshmallows.

– Honey times are changing they won’t bother you. I always see gay people there!

– Mom... gay people aren’t... nevermind. I’m not anxious I just don’t wanna come.

– I understand. You’re safe love. I love you. 

– Yeah... love you too. Have fun!

I swear, every single time my parents think I’m not accompanying them because the transphobic gnomes will get to me! Like people associate with me as a woman why does being trans always seem to be on their mind. I love my family for loving and accepting me and I’m so lucky to have them giving me the opportunity of a great life. But I always feel down when my parents personify me with this trans identity all the time. I sometimes would like it if I was just treated like an anonymous human being and my parents keep on reminding me that I’m different and everywhere I go I need people’s acceptance. In reality people constantly refer to me as a woman because everyone here is very liberal and I pass enough to be categorized as a woman. It seems very trivial to complain about. But whenever I go to a public place they keep reminding me how much things are different these days and back then people would attack a person like me in our area. It’s not the greatest feeling when I’m just getting sun bathed on the beach with my mom constantly reminding me how brave I am and how much no one cares that a person like me is in bikinis on the beach. It feels like I’m only gonna be an edgy gender ambiguous child to my family not their daughter. It also happens sometimes with my friends. Whenever I mention anyone being inappropriate with me or not being polite, they always think it’s directly tied to me being trans and they try to calm me down.

Hey my name's PJ  (19, born Female)

I don't know what I am, and haven't for years. 

Since... Well, since I could remember I have always dressed and acted as the stereotypical male ... I used to take my shirt off to help in the yard, felt very uncomfortable in typical female clothing, I always found  hard making connections with females in a friend sense because I just felt we were never on the same wave length. I even remember praying to God (ironic cause even as a child i didnt believe) to make me a boy..... its all wanted.

As I got older this never went away and I found it got worse when I started to get a chest, I only ever wore sports bras and the bigger that area got the more sports bras I wore... I hated/hate my chest more then anything, I just want that area gone. I have since bought a binder and it's the happiest I've been in a long time but still not great. 

I even got to the point (still recovering) of suffering with an eating disorder which I'm almost certain started because I tried to loose weight around my chest and hips.

Being probably trans or NB is something I haven't told anyone .... mostly because I don't know. I have in-fucking-sane dysphoria surrounding my chest BUT am totally comfortable with it in a sexual situation (I have a 21 year old male boyfriend and I enjoy him touching my chest in a sexual way). So in every other sense i want to cut what i have there off, but in the bedroom it's fine?

I also feel very uncomfortable about my voice and fucking love when I'm sick or have a sore throat because of the deeper sound/raspier sound I have.

I just don't really know what to do... I know that while my boyfriend would support me if i transitioned - he would no longer be My boyfriend (Which the idea of tears my fucking heart 2) and I know that I would loose my connection with my mum and her side of the family . 

And in saying that, I don't even know if transitioning is the right thing to do? I may just be NB and extremely disphoric in which case what can I do about that?

Any advise is awesome, I hope your all have a rad day

So me, my girlfriend and a couple of our friends went out to a comedy night recently. Just a small venue with around 30 people. Multiple comedians up at the front of a room doing some decent bits. All good fun. One of the comedians come on and his whole thing is off the cuff, going off audience interaction. Was all going great, loves his stuff.

Whilst he was telling some funny jokes, my girlfriend was looking over at me, laughing. And he looks at her and asks ""why were you looking over there? I'm on stage here!"". Something along those lines. And my girlfriend responds ""I was looking as Ashleigh"" (Me!). So now she's dragged me in to this, and this guy is not going to let this go.

He goes back and forth between talking about us and other people in the audience. All great, funny stuff. However I am absolutely terrified the entire time.

432,2019-06-10 15:49:07,byzg21,6,3,"I have to post something. I'm losing my fucking mind waiting on this HRT shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm fucking waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting just to find out if I even CAN start HRT with a provider's support. It's making me fucking sick with anxiety. If I can't transition medically, I'm probably going to off myself. That's the conclusion I've come to.

&amp;#x200B;

And waiting on this... it literally feels like my life is on the line, and I'm waiting to hear back. Waiting on more blood work, waiting on word from my doctor, waiting on tons of fucking shit and it feels like I'm making NO progress at all. It's killing me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know I am making some progress, but it's slowed tremendously due to waiting on this medical crap. My BMI is below normal, my hormones (natural ones) are low because of it, and my doctor wanted to check to see if I have a fucking thyroid or pituitary tumor... 

&amp;#x200B;

I was supposed to get results back today but now because of a damn storm, the clinic is closed today because they have no fucking power. What the fuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

It keeps getting worse and worse. My friend was talking about their top surgery last night and how amazing it looks and how great it is and how they have NO visible scars and while I'm super happy for them and glad that it went so amazingly well, I'm still fucking stuck in this part of my transition and unable to do anything but wait and it sucks. And I hate that frustration because I'm sure it comes out on others in some ways here and there, and I don't mean for it to come out, it just does because it depresses the hell out of me and makes me so damned sad because I'm still just...stuck. I HATE feeling stuck. But I can't do anything else now. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know if I'll be able to transition anymore. I feel like my life is on hold. AGAIN. For 2 months I've had the freedom and clarity that comes with finally accepting oneself and beginning to move on with life... And now I'm going backwards. I'm just so sad and anxious and scared that I won't be able to start transitioning. 

&amp;#x200B;

And yes, I know I can do transition socially and by wearing whatever blah blah blah. I've already been doing all those things. And a lot of this is probably just my fears and anxiety amplifying shit... But still. The fear that my eating disorder has permanently fucked up my life and made me unable to go on HRT is just...a lot to take in. I'm so stressed out by this. It would be better if I was waiting to receive my prescription or already been approved or whatever, but I haven't even had the green light yet from my doctor... That's the scary part.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was interesting.. and by interesting I mean uncomfortable. After spending the last two weeks accepting this is the path I must follow and wearing almost exclusively lady undies (lundies?) I decided today I would try to feel more ""male"".. you know, for a friend. So I wore my ""normal"" clothes (closeted, I always wear them in public) with my normal underwear and boy did I fucking hate it. Even at the start of the day when I put them on I was a bit put off and disgusted, it was a bit of a weird shock to me. I may have taken the last two weeks and ran a bit wild with the thought I've finally figured out what was wrong and finally accepted something I've always known, but it was weird to get that affirmation from just underwear. Not to mention, I discovered that I prefer and find it more comfortable for my junk to be all .. I dunno, together? Everything just sits right and sweats waaaaaay less. Why did no one tell me these things!!!!

&amp;#x200B;

Other than the underwear, I was having a lot of self doubt throughout the day. Dysphoria didn't really affect me too much, though it still did and I couldn't help but thinking, ""Maybe I'm just faking this and have a weird fetish or something. Maybe I'm just seeking attention and not really trans. I feel OK now, so maybe it was just a phase"". I keep coming back to these thoughts but the answers aren't there and the feelings eventually come back. I mean, I don't find arousal in wearing woman's clothing, just elation and comfort, so why do I keep thinking maybe its a fetish? Why is this so fucking hard? Why can't I just know and be, why must I struggle and do nothing.. 

&amp;#x200B;

The waning and waxing of dysphoria has been a hell of a thing these past couple weeks and today was definitely no exception. The recognition that dysphoria is what I've been feeling and self discovery as to why that might be has only increased these feelings. I no longer can think about much else as of late. Work has become a bit more difficult, yet I do still feel like a burden was lifted. I guess the only good thing to really come out of all this thus far is that I've been taking better care of myself and actually exercising so I can have a more female body, mainly just to lose some lb's and slim up a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

My question to you gentle viewer: How do you manage your dysphoria as it wanes and waxes? I can only do so much whilst having a roommate and being super in the closet.. I just don't know what to do. Suppose I should seek out a therapist.. yeah maybe I'll do that.

&amp;#x200B;

Oh.. and to make matters worse, I can't even look at women anymore without feeling envious over how they look and a super anxious because I WANT to look like they do... and have boobs.. and have a cute girlfriend that I can be super gay with. And the worst feeling is that I don't even know how to be woman, let along a gay women.. shit I can't even be a straight dude correctly.

I was actually super crossed at my 22nd bday last year and told two of my closest friends that I thought I was trans, and it felt really amazing to say, but then I few months later the thought scared me so I recanted that.

I think part of the reason its so difficult for me to come to terms with is because the task of transitioning just seems so terrifying and insurmountable. but everytime I see an amazing trans girl on here one of the only feelings going through my heart is jealousy.

468,2019-06-11 21:07:04,bzi6u2,0,2,"Lately I have had some experience with one of my closest friends transitioning into becoming a trans-woman. While I wholeheartedly supported her actions, I hope you can imagine it came as somewhat of a shock. We are still the best of friends right now and I always talk to her when I feel like she needs someone to talk to and we have never been on bad terms because of it. 

Personally, I have Asperger's and this makes me speak more openly to people about my curiosities then I should, this of course equates to me asking some harsher questions about how she realized becoming transgender would make her happy and if she might regret the decision later. She told me that she felt trapped in her own body because she couldn’t find a good way to interact with cis-gendered people in a way that allowed her to express herself properly. To the latter question the response that there was no way for her to regret something she desired to such a degree. Knowing her I never questioned these responses came from the heart, yet I still questioned the ultimate outcome and truth to those words.

To me this response seemed to indicate something more, I personally suffer from social anxiety and I know how it is to feel like when you’re never acknowledged. I’ve often felt as a bystander to a world that didn’t fit my description of how life should be and this left me depressed sometimes, not because I wanted it to change, but because I knew it wouldn’t. This friend relates to me on these things, we always shared that anxiety and alienation to a degree. I think her first response indicated the need to get rid of that feeling of not being acknowledged and this led me to think about how these thoughts had ultimately emerged in the first place.

I’m an aspiring psychologist and I always try to look at these kinds of problems at a more psychological level. To me it feels like the (gender roles) of male and female are composed of stereotypical views on certain types of individuals that encompass a group, In this case male and female.

People who often want to improve their musculature features are generally seen as male by the masses, certain clothes, styles of physical improvement (difference between putting on heaps of makeup and taking steroids as an overdone example) and even preferred colors seem to have some semblance of a connection to the predisposed view on these things that the masses seem to try to abide by. From a purely biological point of view this might arise from the view of biological males and females during childhood (males are more erratic and risk taking while girls are generally more emphatic and collected) not that these traits are negative in any way as these are just kids we’re talking about here. This would mean that any deviations from these views on what exemplifies male or female, would probably lead to a negative view of the person in question due to biological prerequisites that arise from the homeostasis of the norm.

I personally also feel left out of this a lot. When I was a kid up to when I was 16 I actually really liked girly shows and even watched my little pony. I also used to take nootropics and this led to a general interest in medically induced performance enhancement. I ultimately even made my own skin creams with chemicals I sourced on ebay. To people around me this was just weird as they found my explanations to be more similar to woman’s makeup. I often do stuff that doesn’t fit my gender role but only because I honestly don’t really mind how people view me. My friends stay my friends and my family will support my decisions and if my coworkers jokes about me doing something weird I just laugh it off.

Now I don’t doubt my friend wants to become a transgender, but I do wonder if something like this happens because people feel like they’re forced into a binary system when it’s actually a dynamic one.

I can imagine why someone who actually wants to dress in drag might feel like they weren’t meant to their assigned gender, even though all they really want is acceptance.

478,2019-06-12 00:58:36,bzkom5,5,4,"I'll just jump straight to it lol.

I have a few points that have lead me to this question.

Ever since I was younger I used to say to myself ""I wish I was a girl"", used to love dressing up in girls clothes makeup etc and always felt more like I can be myself around girls.

When I was younger I remember wanting to die, like literally I felt suicidal thinking to myself I'd rather die before I put my penis inside a vagina.

Secondary school for me was rough, always yearning to fit in with the popular straight boys, for some reason i really wanted to hang out with them even tho we had nothing in common.
I used to think that I wished I was a girl as it would make socialising so much easier and I could be myself more

Idk if these are a gay shame (like afraid to be a feminine guy??) or a trans thing???

So anyway about a year ago I started to do drag, this has confused me, I have becoming obssesed with looking as passable as possible and the idea of not being upsets me, I have had sexual experiences with guys in drag and I feel more comfortable to express myself sexuallly, it's not that I get off on the fact im wearing bras etc it's that I like the idea of being viewed as a girl. Idk if it's just a kink and I'm blowing it out of propoption??

I don't think I have gender dysphoria?? Id say i have gender euphoria?? Honestly im feeling really uncertain but I feel like if I was trans I would be sure? But then at the same time I feel like if I could pass as a woman in my every day life and be referred to as one then I would be happy?? Like the more and more i think about it I'd love to have curves and boobs, I've always been so envious of them. I'm just really confused.... I know I don't have to label myself but I just feel like if I could press a button and nothing in my life would be different except I happen to be a girl I would love it! But idk if it's just a fantasy and I would regret the decision??

I don't know if I'd have a sex change or even if I'd go on hormones, idk it's just such a scary concept bc I would be way too scared of regretting it.

I know this is probably a premature thought but I needed to rant.. I'm just confused (as I've said a lot lol)

let me repeat that.

TRANS WOMEN ARE WOMEN!

that is not up for debate.

There are 2 biological sexes. But gender is just a social construct that has nothing to do with biology.

So we need more words to describe transpeople and their sexuality. Since it's a biological fact that there are 2 sexes, trans women who have sex with biological males are homosexuals.

But that tells us absolutely nothing about what gender they are attracted to, since gender and biology aren't the same thing.

That's why they also need to tell us if they are ""hetero-social"", ""bi-social"", ""homo-social"", or ""poly-social"" when talking about their sexual preferences.

So a trans person should introduce themselves like this. ""Hi I'm Tina. I go by they/them pronouns. I'm a hetero-social, homo-sexual, who's only attracted to cis-men."" Or ""I'm a homo-social heterosexual trans woman who's only attracted to trans men with vaginas.""

I'm a male considering doing a transition to female with hormone replacement therapy.

Right now I'm having a good sexual life with a female partner, who is also very supportive about the trans aspects of my personality. I enjoy sex with her, and I like the, let's call it, ""heterosexual sex"".

So, one of the aspects of HRT that really frightens me is that I've heard and read that it causes erectile dysfunction. I want to transition, but I want my penis to stay functional as ever haha

Maybe I am being naive, I apologize for that.

Would you please tell me your experience in that regard? have you had the same fear? is it true that causes erectile dysfunction?

I was thinking about myself having a kink for so long. For about 8 years now (I'm 18y old now, almost 19). I mean, in my social context, a boy that want to wear a dress it's only a sexual deviance right ?.. So I learned to hate that face of myself more and more and using it only as a kink.. My family haven't helped.. I now shave my legs for two years now. Only because I like the way it feels. And because of the feminine look of it I mean.. This is so satisfying.. And the only thing my mother found to say to me it's ""what's the problem with you ??"" (And we all know how we can care about our mother, and I know she care for me.. she was trying to say ""is there any problem you want to talk about ?"" But she is clumsy with words.. I would even say very stupid. (A friend of mine who work in heavy machinery told me that she was as delicate as a caterpillar D11 if you want to laugh of bit).
I had a girlfriend, it has been a 3 and a half year relationship, she helped me in a way, but blocked the ""transidentity"" part of my reflection. She was saying ""don't think about it, I wouldn't love you if you were different"". (And I realized only 2 months ago how toxic it was, when she broke up with me, cheating on me with her ex). So I kept on the idea that I was only a sexual weirdo. 
So until very recently I have been thinking about how I feel with myself.. and I got in touch with two adorable trans girls &lt;3 I only know them for less than a week and they probably don't know that they mean world to me.. (I'm getting attached to people way too fast. That's a huge problem..). They told me parts of their story about realising that they were trans and shared me mangas and some other things that helped them find out. So recently I have read tons of things about transidenty and even if I'm not used to this subject (and I will probably hurt some of you by accident and I feel already very sorry and I want you to take my *hugs* they are free for you :3), even if that's only recently I got in touch about transidenty, it speaks to me a lot..
So I have been trying to see what I was already doing that means a lot or my vision I had of it. I'll explain..
When I first shaved my leg I wasn't talking of it to anyone. The more I did the more it felt normal to me (and it is). But I loved way more than just the fact that I had suddenly a soft skin but I also had a very feminine looking legs.. that was the most satisfying part of it to me.. I talk about it to Nami (not her real name tho) and she was telling me the same story as mine. But she was still comprehensive towards her true feelings tho..
I then looked at my day to day life and saw the way I liked to do normal things. Even tho I'm not androgynous at all in my gender expression, I quit did few ""feminine"" manner of doing things.. walking differently, the way my hands move when I speak of subjects I like, the way I'm an absolute fangirl talking about people I like or find cute x'3 let my nails growing because they are beautiful :3 finding my eyes nice because they are long.
Looking at me in the mirror, I always did it for two reasons. The first one is removing little black body hair that appears randomly on my skin and the second is the fact I only likes myself when I found feminine lines of my face.. 
But I don't feel legitimate.. I don't feel that wrong or maybe I don't realize it.. but I don't feel sick when I look at me, I do prefer to notice feminine sides of myself but I don't hate myself either.. there is trans people that are way more in need than I do.. so I don't know..

I don't even know yet what I want for myself and if I am actually transgender.. I'm telling this here but I don't know if it's the place or even if I'm authorized to tell that much.. I just.. need clearers answers than the one I've find yet. (I will see a psychologist today, it was about my depression first but then I've find something on me to focus on -that question- so I think it kinda got away with it ^^ So I'll probably talk about that to the psychologist)

Btw, I do try the she/her pronoun currently and I don't know the name I want either.. I quit liked Lily and Lizzie and Milly too (Yes I quit like I/Y x'3 tell me what you think about theses names :3) 
I'll probably ask more help in the few next day I hope it won't bother anyone :3

I think it comes down to three things:

1) They are actually trying to be inclusive (if unsuccessfully).  They are projecting and predicting a world where trans people are the norm and are treated (and mistreated) the same as everyone else. 

2) As with most cis people in the world today, they are probably still uncertain about how to interact with, represent, and include trans people in their work - but they appear to be trying.  The artist states that “she hopes that the ad will ultimately help foster empathy for the LGBTQ community”. I think it is more likely that they are trans-ignorant than trans-phobic - not an excuse, but intentions do mean something. Obviously, I hope they include more humanized trans people to provide balance and alternate perspectives.  And perhaps they should have had a conversation or two with trans people to see the response to this.  

3) Trans means a lot of different things to different people.  Of course some will be offended (and they have a right to be) by fetishization of representations that resemble themselves, but of course all trans people are different humans with one thing in common.

4) Yes, this person (character) is fetishized, but apparently that was the social commentary on mass media that they are trying to make: that the media fetishizes and screws up how we understand human interaction for the purpose of selling crap.  Dystopian fiction always shows things that are jarring or unpleasant - for the express purpose of us going, “oh... that’s terrible.  Wait... that’s only a slight exaggeration of the world right now.”  I genuinely think (and hope) that Cyberpunk 2077 may have that kind of literary merit.  And this can be positive for inclusivity and can promote discussions of gender and sex.  Equality has always been easier to communicate to audiences through sci-fi.  Interestingly, once we see it in the future, we seem to be able to see it as more inevitable and okay.

Before that, I was overweight, and whilst I was secure in my NB identity, felt that I needed to wear heavy makeup every day so that I’d look attractive in a femme/any kind of way (in hindsight, sorting out dysphoria and dysmorphia without help is a bitch). I still think makeup’s super cool, and like wearing it sometimes, but I don’t need it any more - I’m super happy with looking more andro/masc and finding the confidence to finally shave my head had been the most gender euphoric thing.

Anyway, I had a thought, and I hope I’m not offending anyone, but, with the current revolution of eliminating gender roles, and what I male or female should or shouldn’t do by societal standards, whether that’s behavior or dress or whatever, it seems like that trans community kinda feeds the old norm in that regard. 

It almost seems that they feel like they’re the preferred sex, but that manifests as dressing as the preferred sex, having names traditionally given to the preferred sex, instead of helping break those gender norms by simply being whatever sex they are and being however they want and not labeling that to a specific sex’s behavioral trait. Not saying they have to identify as a woman to wear a dress, or to walk/talk/act a certain way. You see what I’m saying?

Anyone else have really bad transition envy? I hate it. It makes me feel like a shit person when I get envious of other people. I hate it a lot. I wish I didn't feel that. 

I was listening to the Gender Rebels podcast the other day and they were talking about it, too, and how you cannot compare yourself to anyone else's timeline because each person has their own unique one and comparison really is just...terrible for mental health. And it is. I've experienced that, comparing and hating and tearing myself down over it... 

The only one, they said, you should be comparing yourself to is you. Compare yourself to how you were 6 months ago, a year ago, hell, a day ago. That is the true comparison that should be being made. 

And I get that, but at the same time, it's human nature to compare. And it sucks. It's not like I want to compare myself to others. Especially when that someone is your friend. It makes me feel like a complete asshole. It makes me hate myself, in a way. I know it's a natural human emotion but jealousy and envy make me feel disgusting and dirty and gross all around. 

But when people boast about their transition and how far along they are and how great they look post surgery and hormones etc it just...makes me feel like I'm absolutely stuck. I'm still over here waiting on fucking blood work (third damned round) to come back a-ok before I am even allowed to try hormones. It's ridiculous. Well, it's not. Logically I know that this is for the best in regard to my safety and health, and that this is part of my process, but it still sucks seeing people so far along in their transition...especially when they're younger than you. Like. Fuck. Why can't I have realized this all sooner and done this sooner? It's frustrating. And unfortunately, part of the process. 

I guess this is sort of just a vent/time-passer while I'm waiting on these damned blood results. Anyways. What's your experience with transition envy? Do you have any? Any good ways to help you deal with it?

I like presenting masculinely and I like being perceived as a boy by strangers. 
However, when it comes to small groups of people who know i’m AFAB, I’m more comfortable not wearing a binder or wearing tighter clothes, even though these things make me feel less like myself. 
Additionally, I’m comfortable with my naked body, although it doesn’t completely feel like myself either. I recently sent a picture of said body to someone and I wasn’t upset by the situation at all. I liked getting a good response from the picture, and it made me rethink everything. 
I have a good body for a female. However, I go through periods of being extremely sure that I want top surgery and not knowing (usually when people compliment my figure on the rare occasion they see it). I think I’d like my body more if I got top surgery, and there are many clothes I dream about wearing if I got it. But I know I’d be losing a part of me that quite honestly, isn’t all bad. 
So the summary is: I have a good body that doesn’t feel like me, but I can appreciate objectively and I know others can too. 
Does it make me less trans for liking my body objectively, or for sending pictures of it to people I trust? Am I trans at all? Anyone else who’s in this boat or has felt this way? 
P.S. I currently ID as non-binary but I don’t like asking people to use they/them due to social stigma, or it could be that the pronouns just don’t quite fit me. I feel masculine but it comes in strange bursts where I feel very trans and want to change my appearance. Some days I’m mostly fine. And I know the way I wrote this post makes it seem like I have little dysphoria, but I just don’t when i’m naked. The second I put clothes on and see my chest or my thighs, I’m miserable.

596,2019-06-15 03:15:29,c0st2d,15,1,"Hi! 

(Sorry if my english sounds weird, not my first language)

So, I'm a boy and I don't seem bothered by that fact nor being called ""he"". But I'm extremely attracted to ""feminine things"" and I desire a more feminine body. I already thought about take oestrogens but since I don't seem experience dysphoria I'm not sure this is a good idea. 

When playing video games I always take a feminine avatar if there is the possibility to choose a female character. I feel better this way. When watching porn (straight porn) I always identify myself with the girl (I'm bisexual and submissive). I like crossdress when I'm alone at home but my passing is meh (my body is very masculine). So I really wonder if I can be transgender even if I don't suffer in my daily life? As a kid I was really attracted by girl toys and wanted to dress as a girl.

i'm agender and would really like to get back into binding since it used to make me feel really comfortable. i used to bind a few years ago, but i ended up giving the binder away when i went through a phase where i didn't want to be trans or even think about my gender bc internalized transphobia/self hate i guess. 

i had an underworks tritop, and i really liked it. the problem is my chest has gotten much bigger just bc i was in the middle of puberty when i used a binder before, and i'm having issues with sizing. i used an xs underworks binder, and also had a small size that i found didn't bind me enough. 

right now i am a 32FF in US sizes, so there is quite a large difference in my waist and my chest size. when i size myself by doing the recommended around the chest sizing i end up with a recommendation for a larger size, but that won't fit me around the rest of my body. 

does anyone know of good binders that work well with people who have a large difference in chest and waist size? recently i've really been feeling the need to have a flat chest, and would really like some advice from anyone who has had this problem and found a good solution.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, fam, I've been having a bit of a rough day today, so I thought I would share as it seems to help.

&amp;#x200B;

Today was one of the first days that I've felt utter terror about being called He and ""possible dad in the future"". It affected me way more than I thought it would. Since I have yet to come out, I'm still a he and expect these types of comments. Overall I have not been having an issue with that, until today. Maybe its because I've becoming more and more accepting of who I really am? 

I was talking with a close friend of mine, who is unfortunately Christian. Not to bash on the Christians out there or anything, to each their own, but I mean.. we all know about Christians. Anyway, we had a bit of a thing for a bit but ultimately her religion and my lack thereof was a big big problem. I've been hinting that there is something on my mind and that I'm working out some shit so she's been trying to cheer me up. Somehow the topic of kids got brought up and she said, ""Someday you'll make an excellent dad, I just know it!"". An insurmountable amount of dysphoria and depression punch right square in my stupid man face and now I'm a bit of a wreck. I replied with a casual, ""I most certainly won't be a dad haha"". Followed by, ""Pretty positive about that"". She obviously doesn't know and was like, ""Oh, you never know you might surprised yourself, blah blah blah"".. I mean she doesn't know and I can't tell her yet. And I'm pretty sure she won't take it well when I do. I can't be upset at her for saying that either but this façade of a man I run around as is starting to break down.

Every day seems to bring me closer and closer to actual acceptance of myself, which is good. It also is bringing me more and more dysphoria and uncomfortability being around people. I mean, I'm already very antisocial and introverted as fuck, like I really need more shit to keep me away.. \*sigh\* its just been a rough day.

 So as the title says i'm kind of confused, that's how i've always feel. From what I can remember of my childhood (because I have very bad memory, and even feel like there is some years completely blank) i've always wanted to be a boy, I would be jealous of my brothers and other boys, I would like be shirtless all the time, do push ups because i wanted muscles, dreamed of having a penis, etc.. 

Then puberty, I don't have a lot of memories of this time because it was not very pleasant, but I managed to find some stuff: when I started to grow breast, I asked my mother when would it stop, and if I could have a surgery to make them smaller, when I first had my period, I was crying that I hated it, I also had a lot of trouble finding clothes that I liked because I couldn't shop in the boy section now that my body was changing, and was pressured to try makeup even if I hated it. 

I've been trying to avoid answering the questions ""am I trans?"" For a few years now, but maybe I shouldn't.. so after some thinking, I feel like I want to look ""like a man"", but not socially be one (for example I like that i'm a lesbian, and I don't see myself as a guy in a relationship, or in a group of guy friends) but every time I see myself more masculine in the mirror, I like it so much (getting a short hair cut, a binder, starting to do some exercise, completely changing my wardrobe with (almost) only men section clothes, has really helped me being more confident) and I also would like to do something about my chest, like reduction or top surgery, even if I don't hate them, maybe because i'm so used to it now, but sometimes I even wish I would get breast cancer so I get them removed without it being my decision, so if i don't like it it's not my fault (sorry if this sounds mean it's just what I really think).

So my question is, can you be trans even if you don't want to live as another gender? Like, I wouldn't want to change my name (well maybe because it's androgynous) or gender marker, or be socially ""manly"", or use ""he"" pronoms.. but I just want to change my body and appearance, is this just a ""look"" thing? Because I don't ""hate"" myself (more like ""i don't care and don't want to think about it either"" feeling) but I wouldn't mind having a male body, but I don't think I would like to be percieved as male.

738,2019-06-18 17:41:12,c25a7g,0,1,"Hello all!  

Sorry for the extremely long post!   

This is partly a question and partly insight concerning my recent struggles with gender identity and sexuality. Its mostly just ramblings about relationships, confusion and why I think this has been so difficult for me but I am also genuinely asking and wondering how to move forward.   

So, lets get into it.    

**The question**  

this is a question that is likely asked a by a lot of people in wide range of situations.   

*""How do I know if I'm trans?""*  

I am currently asking myself and others that right now, but as valid as that question is, I’ve found that there is rarely ever a straight answer.  

I’m sure any of you who have asked this have heard the typical response about how it’s YOUR journey. It’s a question only you can answer. But unfortunately, introspection in that sense is rarely an easy thing to conclusively come to terms with. People change on a daily basis. Moods and feelings are constantly affected by everything in your environment and because of this, a definitive answer is not as much of constant, tangible thing, but a fluid range of emotions that may never stop changing.  

**The discovery**  

In my experience, the question is akin to an addictive substance. Much like a drug, the first time it hits you, it’s a cathartic experience that is incredibly difficult to replicate.  

When I first came to terms with the fact that I may not be as cis as I had previously thought, it was like a wave of emotion and retrospective realizations. Many of the feelings and habits that I had developed throughout my entire life suddenly made more sense. I’ve never been like the other boys, or at least I’ve never felt like them. I’ve always been more emotional despite trying to cover it up to preserve my façade of masculinity. My feelings regarding things like feminine apparel and mannerisms as well as typically un-masculine sentiments about feminism and gender roles made more sense.  

This retrospective awareness occurred in a relatively short measure of time and brought about a new understanding that drastically changed my worldview regarding the trans issues as well as a new perspective on my own past experiences. Unfortunately, that cathartic wave of insight is not likely to happen again.  

Going forward, the journey of self discovery may never reach a peak like that again. It is far more likely to be a slow, arduous series of small decisions and self discoveries that would result in either the decision to transition into the female that I may have always been, or the decision to remain as I am now physically.  

**Relationships**  

Who is the bad guy? Is there one? It really depends on the situation. Often times, relationships fail when gender identity issues come into play. Many couples harbour resentment towards each other for such feelings, and as understandable as it is to be scared and confused, lashing out by either partner is often the main issue.   

**Time for some personal experience and story time:**  

My personal issue stems from the fact that I have been in a relationship for nearly 8 years now and I love my S/O dearly. She is the most important thing in my life and I would do anything for her. That being said, we are at sort of an impasse. We are both very open and accepting of transgender as well as LGBTQIA+ issues as we have both been exposed to it in the past. We recently came to the realization that despite our being in a straight relationship for nearly a decade, we may not be as straight and cis as we thought. I currently identify as pansexual and she identifies as Bisexual but that is something we are both still coming to terms with and that may not be entirely true for either of us.  

It’s somewhat strange that our relationship being as stable as it is makes this a relatively difficult subject to tackle. We’ve been dating since high school, I’m her first boyfriend and she is my first actual *serious* girlfriend. We are only in or early 20’s, but even as recently as we were in high school, The LGBT community was stigmatized and alienated so exploring our sexual identity was still extremely difficult when we started dating. Now that were more comfortable with it and the world is more accepting, were already together so how do we do anything? That being said, that shouldn’t be taken as if we were settling for each other in any way when we started dating, but since were so committed to each other, we’ve never had any reason to further explore our sexual identities and preferences. We currently have no real way of experimenting or exploring these feelings without potentially seeing other people but neither of us are open to that idea, but with that in mind we do know we both feel something other than straight.  

That being said, with my recent gender identity crisis, it has led to us being confused and unsure of how to feel moving forward. I MIGHT be trans, and she WANTS to be okay with that and support me, but she doesn’t know if she can handle it. In fact, I’m fairly unsure of it myself. We both grew up surrounded by people from every part of the LGBT+ community from trans and gay friends to gay aunts, uncles and grandparents so we are both very supportive and passionate about the community. But that experience doesn’t make the situation any easier when its so close to home.   

Its easy to say, “well you’re bi/pan, you should be able to like me for me regardless of my gender” but I know it doesn’t work that way. Just because someone is bi, doesn’t mean they are automatically obligated to be attracted to everybody. There is still the question of attraction to an individual and we have no idea if she could be attracted to me as a different gender which is unfortunate, but also fair.  

Despite her confusion about the issue, she has been immensely supportive. Fortunately, she has a talent for hair and makeup. I’m slightly taller but we are mostly the same size in clothes, we have generally the same style and fashion sense and we already share clothes quite often. We also go out of town quite often making it easy for me to try presenting female in a comfortable environment. Even though she’s unsure of the whole ordeal, she has still done her best to help me try things such as makeup, hair and wigs, clothing, shaving and presenting female in general. This past weekend we were out of town so she helped me with my makeup, lent me some clothes and underwear, and fixed me up with one of her fairly high quality wigs and I spent an entire day as a female in public thanks to her help. but that hasn’t made her any more comfortable with the idea.   

We still had a great time together, we basically did what we would do on any other vacation, but at the end of the day, it was still weird for her and I get why. I’ve always been her boyfriend, and despite being the same person, its still a large change that she’s not sure she could ever get used to and she’s not sure if she could ever really be physically attracted to me as a female.  

**Now for MY perspective on our issue:**   

I don’t even know what I am, and despite being pan and my sexuality covering such a wide range, when it comes to my gender, I don’t know if I could be anything other than male or female. If remain a male, I don’t see a problem with myself being a relatively femme male, but when I present female, I begin to resent my masculine features and want to be as feminine as possible.   

As much as I understand that it is up to me alone to discover my gender identity, she still plays a big part in my life. With that in mind, our relationship and her feelings serve as another factor in whether I could decide to transition or not. There is a real possibility that I could decide that I want to transition, but it might cause a rift in our relationship. In many people’s opinions, that shouldn’t factor so heavily into my individual identity, but it does. She is important enough to me that there is a significant chance that even if I do end up wanting to transition, I would decide not to in order to preserve our relationship because either gender wouldn’t be worth it without her in the picture. Many would say that repressing my feeling on the subject would be unhealthy and could severely affect my mental health, but depending how strongly I feel the need to transition, I would be more than willing to give up far more than just my gender identity to make her happy.  

I couldn’t lie to her about it either. We’re extremely open with each other, but we’re still worried that this could cause issues later on (mostly with mental health). She also hates that she’s so unsure about it and that she’s effecting my decision so heavily. I almost wish she didn’t know about my internal struggle to save her from feeling so bad about it but I know that dealing with this without her input would be wrong. She deserves to know how I’m feeling and have her feeling be known just as much as I do.  

We’ve talked about this extensively, but we feel like we’ve hit a wall. I might want to transition, but I don’t even know *how* to find out if that truly is what I want. She wants to be okay with it, but she doesn’t know if she can be.   

**In Conclusion**  

How can we move forward in this situation?  We don’t see breaking up as an option or even a possibility, but we also don’t want this to longer over us forever.   

We haven’t fought about it at all and we both see each others perspectives clearly so that isn’t an issue. We’ve even been to therapy and our counselor has told us that we’re handling this far better than most people she sees with the same issues. But that doesn’t change the fact that we’re still confused as to what we can do going forward.   

I don’t know if anyone has any suggestions, insights or even just general support, but anything would be much appreciated.

I don’t have a diagnosis from a therapist because my severe depression and agoraphobia and anxiety which are all extensions of my trans-issues make it impossible to be at all productive with my own life. IE holding a job and even brushing my fucking teeth sometimes. So no. I don’t have the official diagnosis. But I’ve felt this way since I was 3 years old. It’s one of my earliest memories. It’s been right behind me for my entire life whether I’ve acknowledged it or not. So I put in the work on my own time and made my own psychological breakthroughs and I *know* that HRT is what I need next. I’m sure you can empathize on some level. 

Anyway the appointment started with some extensive questioning as I was sure it would. As things progressed the doctor interrupted me often saying things like “be more specific” or “when you say ‘it’ [in reference to dysphoria] what do you mean?”  Like, trying to direct me to a specific statement, but it was as though he wouldn’t just tell me what he wanted to hear, but rather push me blindly toward It. I’m sure what he wanted to hear was “I’m a woman trapped in a mans body”. But that isn’t an accurate description. That’s not how I feel. I’m not interested in social transition right now at all; only if HRT leads me there eventually. I want, no, I NEED my brain function. I’m effectively useless. 

I explained that i have been totally clean for almost two years. Even explained that I STARTED using drugs in order to hide from my trans feelings. Explained before I started I said to myself “I’d rather be a dead addict than alive and trans.” 

Anyway in the end he basically told me “based on your description, nothing leads me to believe this is dysphoria over depression, or “drug psychosis” “ at which point my brain shut down and I had to fight back tears. Then I handed him the paperwork I had filled out in his lobby which stated very clearly that I was in the office “to start HRT today” at which point he seemed super confused and said “let’s book another appointment and continue talking and then maybe we can get started” 

I don’t think I believe that he means that. And the follow up was booked for two and a half months away. 

I’m afraid that I won’t survive until the next appointment. I even had the initial blood work results with me yesterday. 

For my entire life I’ve struggled with being suicidal. That became under control while I was waiting for this first appointment; but now I’m so scared that I won’t make it to the next appointment. Or worse I will make it there and he still will be convinced my severe dysphoria is “just depression” or “drug psychosis”. 
 

I don’t want to die. I want my life. I want to be who I was always supposed to be. 

But now it feels like that has all been taken away from me and I’m so fucking afraid. I don’t know if I’m here looking for advice,or just some solidarity. I’m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. And I’m sorry if I sound like an ingrate. Truly. I’m just so lost now.

767,2019-06-19 14:49:43,c2i08r,16,44,"Imagine hearing this from your partner...I did recently. 

A few months ago I moved in to my partner's house. My gender identity became a big issue for them when they saw all my clothing. They pressed me to start questioning my gender identity... It is not something I thought about too much about before.

I've always privately transcended gender norms, and I always kinda knew I was trans, but until she pushed me in that direction I never considered actually doing anything about it publicly. It has always been too terrifying for me, I'm pretty sure my family won't accept me if I come out. When I came out to my mom she told me it was a lie from the devil and it was not true...ouch.

While I am trans, I haven't transitioned yet, and I may never do so...my discomfort with my birth gender hasn't overcome my fear of rejection. I have dysphoria but I can usually cope with it. I've always admired and respected trans people who are brave enough to be themselves publicly.
 
I've always struggled with accepting myself and kept the truth hidden because most of my direct family is openly transphobic. I didn't realize before, but now I realize my partner is too. They want ""the old me"" back; the ""me"" that conformed to traditional rigid gender norms because I feared rejection.

I just want to be myself and be loved. When I finally came out to my partner, they kicked me out and demanded my house key. I really thought when I met them, I had found someone who would love me for who I was inside, not just for my external appearance. I was wrong.

So, I'm currently homeless and single, sleeping on a friend's couch. My heart is broken. I don't know what to do.

Every time I saw a trans flag, I looked over in adoration. You guys are at the front lines of the fight today, setting new trends and telling people that it's okay to be themselves.

Trans people are some of the bravest people I've ever known. When you didn't feel like the person society expected you to be, instead of laying down and giving up like so many have, you did something about it. You said that you didn't want to be cisgender anymore, and that you wanted to be who you truly feel like. You knew that there would be risk coming out as male or female, but you chose to take that step anyway. You invested and sacrificed time and money into becoming the person you wanted to be. And when it was rough, whether because someone didn't like the changes you went through, or because you were misgendered, you just kept going, fighting for yourself.

I just wanted to say thank you. You're laying down the road to a brighter future, one where people get to be who they choose. I'm sorry that some people don't seem to respect that, but many of us do.

That being said... How did you realize you were trans? Have you known it all along? Or maybe it was more like looking at the person in the mirrow and wondering who the heck they are. Like (I'm sorry but I have hard time putting that in words), I was born in a woman's body and I'd probably say I am one, but is that so? I call myself a girl and I hate it, in jokes I sometimes refer to myself ""ya boi"" or like that and it feels so much better! But I don't know if I am a man, because well, I was raised as a girl and there are obviously some ""girly"" things that I like, like the pink color (it's funny how until 50's it was actually considered a boy color and blue was seen as girly) and even in a male body I would sometimes wear dresses and makeup, because why not, sometimes even I pretend to myself that I'm a male crossdresser when dressing girly. And most of my friends are girls. But then again, I was usually perceived as the boyish one among them. Even in a dress and full make up I just look at women, then look at myself and I really feel like a man dressed up like a woman, like I'll never be able to be ""like them"", to really belong. When my father tells me to dress more girly and wear dresses, make up etc, to act more girly, internally I'm like ""oh why don't you go and do it yourself"".  I would ""borrow"" his clothes and toiletries sometimes when I was younger and damn, I wish my boobs could just vanish and I would just have a penis instead, I wish I could grow a mustache. However the though of that kinda freaks me out. I'm scared. Because what if that's just a phase in my case? What if I'm just seeking attention? What if the only, only, only reason why I hate my body is actually the overweight and that's it? What if I just don't fit certain stereotypes about girls that actually many women don't fit, and now I'm simply overthinking?

938,2019-06-23 20:01:31,c4ar90,0,2," 

It was pride this weekend and my friends and I got fucked up on a bunch of shit all day. At 11 pm, I ground up 7g of shrooms and took a point and a half of molly. I went out with my friend and as we were walking; I realized there was weird energy between us. He got increasingly uncomfortable until we went to an art exhibit and he told me he wanted to be alone. I respected his wishes even though I really wanted to hang out with him and I went home.

I hung out with someone else I knew and got to really know and empathize with them. As we talked, they turned into 6 copies and overlapped turning into a different person. I went shopping with them and as we were walking; I felt my memories go away and my thoughts almost disappear. I didn't even realize we were at the shop until I had changed into a frilly green tank top and green shoes. As my consciousness returned, I felt a crazy rush of emotions and I blurted out that I am a girl. I came out to all my friends of snapchat as a girl before I even realized I did that.

As I came down, I got terrified and confused and I felt super uncomfortable in my skin; I went to look in the mirror and my body wasn't what I wanted. I'm too tall, too masculine, and too muscular for my dream body. My friend returned from his spiritual journey and learned about self-love and fully integrated a lot of aspects of his life. He told me before that he was in love with me and I told him the same back and when he came back; I told him how much I love and need him he said we need to talk.

I sit down and he tells me he isn't attracted to me and he's confused why he's mourning for someone I never had. He said on the journey he realized that his favorite person is toxic for him and that even if I thought he was the best thing in my life; he said falling in love with me was bad to him. I was so hurt even on molly I felt like crying and I just stuck to myself and I left him alone until a little later when he said: ""Why did you storm off?"" I still love you and then the next day he does the same thing and says he loves and I'm his best friend.

After I came down, I felt increasingly horrible until a few hours later I took 2 points and 180ug of acid. I've taken 1400ug of acid and it wasn't so intense for me that I couldn't talk, I thought the cross-tolerance would ruin the tabs for me but I saw 4d tesseracts in the lights, tracers everywhere, and I saw this street light turn into a fuzzy caterpillar. Plus I didn't even realize I was high, I thought I was fully sober during the come up. My friend asked me to stay over and cuddle with him, and on the candyflip, I didn't want too but then he started crying and I couldn't help it and I held him until he fell asleep then I went to my room.

Next day I rolled again, and stacked 2-3 times, I don't know much I took but it could have been .3-.5 grams in the day. I felt a lot better around him and I almost completely forgot about yesterday because of the molly. Later in the night, we went out clubbing with friends and I put on my tank top and dosed with molly, when it hit I started to feel comfortable in my skin again and we entered the club. The bouncers at the front yelled at us and kicked us to the back and I noticed my anxiety start rising very suddenly. My friend got scared of the bouncers frisking us and gave me the molly to hide and at this point, I am levels of paranoid.

We get in and I occasionally get weird looks, basically homophobes. I start to feel more self-conscious and my breathing is getting harder and harder to control. My friend keeps holding my hand lovingly and trying to kiss me and I remember what he said yesterday and I just don't feel it anymore but he won't stop and keeps making moves. Eventually, he goes off and makes out with other guys and does his own shit. I kept watch on one of my other friends who got fully wasted and was acting up too much, I told my sister to watch her while I found my best friend.

He tells me if I want to actually have fun and stop babysitting come down to the men's bathroom and only if I want to stop being annoying. I was concerned so I went down anyway and got in line for the bathroom. There was a bouncer at the front of the door and while I was looking he put his hand down my tank top and squeezed my chest. I was so confused and scared, I looked at him like what?!? and then he did it again with a big smile and when I moved away to behind someone else he laughed and talked to his friends.

At this point, my mentality felt almost completely destroyed I realized who I am but at the cost of my safety and intimidation factor. No dude would fuck with me had I been wearing a t-shirt and used a hard face instead I had to be more like myself. At this point I finally find my friend and I tell him to come along and he says ""Hey I won't remember any of this tomorrow"" and winked. I just felt so disturbed by this point and I fully felt like I was losing my happiness and access to my true gender and feelings.

I really quickly reverted back to before the hippie flip the day before and as my friend and I are walking away, the same bouncer grabs his thigh and squeezes it really hard. We get out of the room and he tells him this and starts crying and says he is starting to feel really scared. I get him, my sister, and my friends, together and we leave to go eat. I navigate them and get them some food and they keep doing drunk shit even when cops were around or when guards told us to stop standing places.

They all kept antagonizing people and starting shit. After we get food, I get the uber and we get back home.

I take a shit ton of molly, alcohol, and weed then go to my room and pass out.

My best friend keeps texting me to not ice him out but I can't feel anything for him right now. Honestly, it was a terrible day yesterday, I told him I needed space today and that I don't know how I feel right now. I was going to take more molly today and go out but I decided to just chill out and let my serotonin machine get back to work.",trans,I came out on drugs this weekend and had falling out with my best friend,1561345291.0,"{'created_utc': 1561320091, 'id': 'c4ar90', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 2, 'selftext': ' \n\nIt was pride this weekend and my friends and I got fucked up on a bunch of shit all day. At 11 pm, I ground up 7g of shrooms and took a point and a half of molly. I went out with my friend and as we were walking; I realized there was weird energy between us. He got increasingly uncomfortable until we went to an art exhibit and he told me he wanted to be alone. I respected his wishes even though I really wanted to hang out with him and I went home.\n\nI hung out with someone else I knew and got to really know and empathize with them. As we talked, they turned into 6 copies and overlapped turning into a different person. I went shopping with them and as we were walking; I felt my memories go away and my thoughts almost disappear. I didn\'t even realize we were at the shop until I had changed into a frilly green tank top and green shoes. As my consciousness returned, I felt a crazy rush of emotions and I blurted out that I am a girl. I came out to all my friends of snapchat as a girl before I even realized I did that.\n\nAs I came down, I got terrified and confused and I felt super uncomfortable in my skin; I went to look in the mirror and my body wasn\'t what I wanted. I\'m too tall, too masculine, and too muscular for my dream body. My friend returned from his spiritual journey and learned about self-love and fully integrated a lot of aspects of his life. He told me before that he was in love with me and I told him the same back and when he came back; I told him how much I love and need him he said we need to talk.\n\nI sit down and he tells me he isn\'t attracted to me and he\'s confused why he\'s mourning for someone I never had. He said on the journey he realized that his favorite person is toxic for him and that even if I thought he was the best thing in my life; he said falling in love with me was bad to him. I was so hurt even on molly I felt like crying and I just stuck to myself and I left him alone until a little later when he said: ""Why did you storm off?"" I still love you and then the next day he does the same thing and says he loves and I\'m his best friend.\n\nAfter I came down, I felt increasingly horrible until a few hours later I took 2 points and 180ug of acid. I\'ve taken 1400ug of acid and it wasn\'t so intense for me that I couldn\'t talk, I thought the cross-tolerance would ruin the tabs for me but I saw 4d tesseracts in the lights, tracers everywhere, and I saw this street light turn into a fuzzy caterpillar. Plus I didn\'t even realize I was high, I thought I was fully sober during the come up. My friend asked me to stay over and cuddle with him, and on the candyflip, I didn\'t want too but then he started crying and I couldn\'t help it and I held him until he fell asleep then I went to my room.\n\nNext day I rolled again, and stacked 2-3 times, I don\'t know much I took but it could have been .3-.5 grams in the day. I felt a lot better around him and I almost completely forgot about yesterday because of the molly. Later in the night, we went out clubbing with friends and I put on my tank top and dosed with molly, when it hit I started to feel comfortable in my skin again and we entered the club. The bouncers at the front yelled at us and kicked us to the back and I noticed my anxiety start rising very suddenly. My friend got scared of the bouncers frisking us and gave me the molly to hide and at this point, I am levels of paranoid.\n\nWe get in and I occasionally get weird looks, basically homophobes. I start to feel more self-conscious and my breathing is getting harder and harder to control. My friend keeps holding my hand lovingly and trying to kiss me and I remember what he said yesterday and I just don\'t feel it anymore but he won\'t stop and keeps making moves. Eventually, he goes off and makes out with other guys and does his own shit. I kept watch on one of my other friends who got fully wasted and was acting up too much, I told my sister to watch her while I found my best friend.\n\nHe tells me if I want to actually have fun and stop babysitting come down to the men\'s bathroom and only if I want to stop being annoying. I was concerned so I went down anyway and got in line for the bathroom. There was a bouncer at the front of the door and while I was looking he put his hand down my tank top and squeezed my chest. I was so confused and scared, I looked at him like what?!? and then he did it again with a big smile and when I moved away to behind someone else he laughed and talked to his friends.\n\nAt this point, my mentality felt almost completely destroyed I realized who I am but at the cost of my safety and intimidation factor. No dude would fuck with me had I been wearing a t-shirt and used a hard face instead I had to be more like myself. At this point I finally find my friend and I tell him to come along and he says ""Hey I won\'t remember any of this tomorrow"" and winked. I just felt so disturbed by this point and I fully felt like I was losing my happiness and access to my true gender and feelings.\n\nI really quickly reverted back to before the hippie flip the day before and as my friend and I are walking away, the same bouncer grabs his thigh and squeezes it really hard. We get out of the room and he tells him this and starts crying and says he is starting to feel really scared. I get him, my sister, and my friends, together and we leave to go eat. I navigate them and get them some food and they keep doing drunk shit even when cops were around or when guards told us to stop standing places.\n\nThey all kept antagonizing people and starting shit. After we get food, I get the uber and we get back home. One of the girls invites a random guy from outside into the room and they all get more fucked up. By this point, I am through emotionally and all the happiness and certainty in who I am is gone. I take a shit ton of molly, alcohol, and weed then go to my room and pass out.\n\nMy best friend keeps texting me to not ice him out but I can\'t feel anything for him right now.

Im a girl (mtf) living in the south, I’m still young and live with my family so my job is just temporary for added income to buy goodies for my hobbies and stuff. 

I’m working in construction with my step-dad as his work partner and while the paychecks are fat I often find myself on the brink of a breakdown. I feel so stressed out at work from the dysphoria. My day drags on at a snails pace. I feel angry and sad constantly, I can’t fall asleep from the sheer dread of tomorrows work day. Having to force myself to act as masculine guy is eating away my morale, its soul crushing.

I find my stress and anxiety eating up my free-time, I’m constantly looking at the clock wondering how many hours I have till I have to go back to that hellhole of a trigger. I’m so absolutely terrified to even ask for a day off let alone quit, I’ve been in this job for only a month-ish and do not want to seem lazy, or weak. No one knows I’m trans besides my best friends and mom so I can’t tell people whats bothering me. I just tell my coworkers I’m tired or sick as an excuse. I know my parents will be passive aggressive about me quitting if I do, and my mom will just be mean about anything I say. I’m also the only atheist in my family which is horrible, on top of me being the only non-straight person in a Hispanic family.

So, how do y’all deal with workplace dysphoria?

I attract many CIS females in clubs that a ton of guys give me props for since I am usually found attractive, I like the fact that I am different. Fuck society.    


But I wish I had these desires and thoughts inside me but NEVER acted on them before or yet.. Because when I meet a super hot or beautiful trans girl, I want to tell her and genuinely KNOW, that I never kissed a trans girl before her. I am just a typical, heterosexual dude. BUT she is that pretty that I will kiss her and maybe make love or Fuck the shit out of here and make her feel like the gorgeous, young woman she is.

But me kissing two trans girls. One was native american, the other Filipino, it would not make me unique to her.  I will just be some guy with a fetish.  If I told her I never even kissed a Tgirl before, she will feel so special, like, ""Wow he never even kissed a Tgirl before but he thought I am so beautiful that he kissed me. Im proud""  instead of, ""Oh hes just a guy with a fetish"" which im not.  

So afterwards it was interested sure, But I wish I never did it.. It takes away from everything. My first trans kiss won't be magical to ME or to the Trans girl. I will just be a guy who already kissed a trans girl before. It won't be like the first time magical moment that I prove to her I am not like the rest of the guys.

I think about how dangerous world is, and fragile we all are. We can get in a fight and break our hand or get brain injuries so easily, this isn't a video game. It is so exciting.. Life.. Human Emotions.. How easily we can die yet kill.

But I don't know if it fits here either. I don't think I qualify as trans. I just need somewhere to put all this, so I hope you'll bear with me.   


I'm confused. I never thought I'd say that. Biologically i'm a man, I know that. But I have feelings I don't really understand. I've always had feelings I don't really understand. I like girls clothes, I like makeup (the idea of it anyway. I like it on other people. I've never had any or done it myself.) I like the idea of being a cute girl and being feminine. I remember my sister playing dress-up sometimes with me when i was a kid. She'd put me in an old dress of hers and do my makeup and i'd feel so good. Even then I loved how it felt to be girly.   
But i'm also not hugely dysphoric. I don't hate my body. I don't hate my penis. I don't feel sick when I look at myself. I'm fine with being a man. It doesn't bother me, I don't feel wrong in my own skin.   
But at the same time sometimes I wish I had been born a girl. I wish I could have grown up playing with dolls, and wearing dresses, and having sleepovers with girls. I wish I had long hair, and a feminine body. I wish that I had a soft sweet voice. There's this scene in the movie 'Synecdoche, New York'. The main character is about to have sex with a woman and she takes off her clothes and he doesn't understand how she can be so comfortable naked. He says something to the extent of ""maybe it's because you have a beautiful body. Maybe that helps. Sometimes I wish I was pretty like that."" She asks him ""You want to be a chick?"" and he pauses before saying ""Sometimes I think I would have been better at it."" She comes up to him, and puts her hand on his back, and calls him pretty. And he starts to cry and says ""Thank you. Thank you for saying that."" That scene touches something deep in my heart. Sometimes I wish I was pretty. I'll never be pretty. Nobody will ever look at me and call pretty. Just writing that is making my eyes water.  
But it's not like I feel that way all the time. Sometimes I wish that I was handsome. But I wish it in a different way than when i'm wishing to be pretty. I wish I was handsome because I want women to like me. I want women to look at me and think i'm attractive. I'm not attractive, I know that. I can get dates but never by my looks. Women get used to me, and like my personality, and that gets me dates. But I wish that a woman would look at me and just want to jump my bones. But that'll never happen, especially not if they knew about any of this. People aren't exactly attracted to those who suffer from an existential identity crisis.   


Sometimes I think about transitioning, but never seriously. It's just a thought that I entertain occasionally. I think 'Well if you want to be a girl you can be, you could spend the rest of your life as girl.' and then I think 'No I can't. I'm a man. I'll never be a girl. I'll never have the experience of growing up as a girl. I'll never be seen as a girl by others, or by myself. I'll always see myself as a boy playing pretend.'   


And it's not like i'm young. I'm in my mid 20's. And i'm a big guy. I'm 6'4, and i'm growing increasingly bald everyday. My voice has been extremely deep my whole life. I have no feminine features. I crossdress sometimes and look at myself and just get sad. I look gross when I try to be fem. I can't pull it off at all. I would never be attractive as a woman. And i'd never have the experiences I longed for. I'll never get to be a young woman. I could, at best, be a woman for (the rest of) my adult life. But that doesn't feel like enough. Ill never have the experiences cis women had and that makes me feel like i'd be even less of a woman than them.  


And then there's all the fears with transitioning. I'm slightly bi I guess, but I mainly love girls. Like, 98% of my sexuality is towards women. I can see a guy and go, oh he's hot. And I have an attraction for some penises I guess, but i'm really picky about them. But at the end of the day, I like my sexuality. And transitioning can change it. I don't want it to change. I don't want to be less attracted to women. I don't really want to be more attracted to men. Not that there's anything wrong with being attracted to men, mind you. But i'm happy with my sexuality where it's at. I want it to stay the same. I want to spend my life with a beautiful caring woman. And what if it changed my personality? I like who I am as a person. I don't want to become someone different mentally. I only want the physical changes.   


And I don't think I could ever find love or affection from a woman as a woman. Not from the type of women I like anyway. I like really pretty feminine women. And I know i'd be ugly if i transitioned. I'd never be able to date or be with someone beautiful. Not to mention the facts that only something like 4% of people identify as lgbt, so my dating pool would be even smaller. And then i'd have to find women within that smaller dating pool who not only liked women but were okay with someone who wasn't always a woman. It'd be really hard to find someone who met those criteria and who I thought was beautiful and who had a compatible personality.  


And i'm terrified of the surgery to get a vagina. I'm terrified that sex wouldn't feel good, and that i'd never be able to be sexually satisfied again. I like sex right now. Like I said, I don't hate having a penis. I enjoy having sex with women as a man. What if I hated it as a woman? Or what if I were to regret it? What if I changed it and then went ""nope, this isn't right."" And I know I could keep my penis, I don't have to have that surgery. But that lowers the amount of people who would want to be with me even more. I'd be even less likely to find love. I don't want to spend my life alone. I'm alone now and it's terrible. I'm so damn lonely. I want someone in my life. I'm much more likely to find that as a man.   


I don't know. I don't know anything. I'm not really serious about any of this, I guess. I feel like a jackass, like i'm intruding into the space of people with issues I don't have. Like i'm playing around with a label that doesn't belong to me. I'm sorry if this post is awful. I feel kind of awful for making it. I can't imagine myself ever changing my gender, not really. I know i'll be a man for the rest of my life. But sometimes I wish I could just snap my fingers and become feminine. I wish I could be someone else. I wish I had been born as like, a cute lesbian girl.

My voice has been extremely deep my whole life. I have no feminine features. I crossdress sometimes and look at myself and just get sad. I look gross when I try to be fem. I can\'t pull it off at all. I would never be attractive as a woman. And i\'d never have the experiences I longed for. I\'ll never get to be a young woman. I could, at best, be a woman for (the rest of) my adult life. But that doesn\'t feel like enough. Ill never have the experiences cis women had and that makes me feel like i\'d be even less of a woman than them.  \n\n\nAnd then there\'s all the fears with transitioning. I\'m slightly bi I guess, but I mainly love girls. Like, 98% of my sexuality is towards women. I can see a guy and go, oh he\'s hot. And I have an attraction for some penises I guess, but i\'m really picky about them. But at the end of the day, I like my sexuality. And transitioning can change it. I don\'t want it to change. I don\'t want to be less attracted to women. I don\'t really want to be more attracted to men. Not that there\'s anything wrong with being attracted to men, mind you. But i\'m happy with my sexuality where it\'s at. I want it to stay the same. I want to spend my life with a beautiful caring woman. And what if it changed my personality? I like who I am as a person. I don\'t want to become someone different mentally. I only want the physical changes.   \n\n\nAnd I don\'t think I could ever find love or affection from a woman as a woman. Not from the type of women I like anyway. I like really pretty feminine women. And I know i\'d be ugly if i transitioned. I\'d never be able to date or be with someone beautiful. Not to mention the facts that only something like 4% of people identify as lgbt, so my dating pool would be even smaller. And then i\'d have to find women within that smaller dating pool who not only liked women but were okay with someone who wasn\'t always a woman. It\'d be really hard to find someone who met those criteria and who I thought was beautiful and who had a compatible personality.  \n\n\nAnd i\'m terrified of the surgery to get a vagina. I\'m terrified that sex wouldn\'t feel good, and that i\'d never be able to be sexually satisfied again. I like sex right now. Like I said, I don\'t hate having a penis. I enjoy having sex with women as a man. What if I hated it as a woman? Or what if I were to regret it? What if I changed it and then went ""nope, this isn\'t right."" And I know I could keep my penis, I don\'t have to have that surgery. But that lowers the amount of people who would want to be with me even more. I\'d be even less likely to find love. I don\'t want to spend my life alone. I\'m alone now and it\'s terrible. I\'m so damn lonely. I want someone in my life. I\'m much more likely to find that as a man.   \n\n\nI don\'t know. I don\'t know anything. I\'m not really serious about any of this, I guess. I feel like a jackass, like i\'m intruding into the space of people with issues I don\'t have. Like i\'m playing around with a label that doesn\'t belong to me. I\'m sorry if this post is awful. I feel kind of awful for making it. I can\'t imagine myself ever changing my gender, not really. I know i\'ll be a man for the rest of my life. But sometimes I wish I could just snap my fingers and become feminine. I wish I could be someone else. I wish I had been born as like, a cute lesbian girl.   \n\n\nI\'ve never told anybody any of this before.

Since I finally did it today, literally a few minutes ago, I think I can give some tips now. This will be divided into three parts:  The Pull-up, The Psychological Barrier, and the Shot.

&amp;#x200B;

# The Pull-up

1. **The Testosterone bottles are small, so make sure to get more ordered by your endo.** I do weekly injection shots now, and each bottle (depending on what amount you start on, I'm on .13 right now) holds about 2-3 shots. 
2. **How do I tell the difference between the T and air?** It's actually easier than you think! The Testosterone is lightly discolored, but it looks clear to the ""untrained eye"". You can also see a ring separating the air from the medicine, so that too is helpful.
3. **Take in more medicine then you need before going to the actual amount.** This will help with making sure there are no air bubbles picked up when drawing up. For example, if you have, say, my dosage, which is .13, you would go to .15 before you go down to the actual amount.
4. **Remember to Disinfect!** Always have those disenfectant wipes (the tiny chlorine smelling ones, you know, those ones.) on you. Disinfect the top part of the bottle (which is puncturable) before drawing up. Just a precaution.

# The Psychological Barrier

1. **This is something I dealt with- heavily.** The psychological barrier, as I call it, is a barrier that prevents you from going anywhere near the injection site. It sucks. Its anxiety, whether it be from questions such as: Will it hurt? will it go in easily? or from a fear of needles. So how do you get over it?
2. **For the first few shots, get help from parents or your endo.** This will help you get used to the feeling of the needle inside the injection site. Just a precaution!
3. **Next, go into a room, alone.** if you need help still, get a parent or an endo. In my experience, having people watching me stopped me from preparing myself about the injection. It made me more anxious. You might not be the same.
4. **Get as close as you possibly can to your injection site.** This definitely helped me today. I slowly put the needle on the skin, not enough to break it, but began to poke and prod around the same area. It helped me understand that: ""Okay, this is what it feels like to put the needle on my own skin"". Keep going away and back to the injection side with the needle, getting closer and closer. Soon enough you'll be able to inject.

# The Shot

1. **What does it feel like?** I first thought it would be like putting a wooden stir stick (the tiny, rounded off things you use in cooking) into a pan of cornbread. you know what I mean? But it really isn't. Its a glide, like the injection point doesn't exist.
2. **Does it hurt?** Not at all, if you do it correctly. As long as you're putting the needle in- **straight** in, you'll be fine. The bleeding, if you get any, wont be anything major and will stop quick. There might be a little pinch before going in, and a little pain after the shot, but you'll take it like a champ.
3. **Take deep breaths.** Keep your hand steady, take deep breaths, and stay calm. You'll do fine.

So I'm trans MTF, and had been 100% certain of that for somewhere between 9 and 16 months (I really suck at timelines). I don't entirely know what really snapped me into this mindset, or helped me spill my own beans, or however you want to word it.

My whole life I'd just been one of the guys who hung out around a fluid group of people. Sometimes I was with the guys, sometimes with the girls, and sometimes with a mix of the two, but I was always just a guy back in my childhood. I didn't really know that any of this was a thing, much less that it was okay. I spent my life, up until a few years ago, certain that I wanted to grow up to be something manly (but not overly manly) like a sniper for the military. Then again, I've always been pushed towards so many things by stereotypes, that I assumed I had to be muscular. I remember always growing my hair out, less so because it felt girly or right than because I hated having it short. Hell, I used to make fun of myself for being *too* girly.

Coming into Middle School, I started wearing more feminine clothes, stopped wearing shorts, and hating myself for my masculine-looking physique. I don't work out much, and back then I didn't do it at all, but I've always had a little bit of a strong looking upper body, and that's made me kinda self-conscious recently. In Middle School was where all of the ""God you're so girly. What are you, fucking gay?"" kind of shit started. I got tired of it quick, and, being a bubbling crockpot of testosterone, would often resort to violence, which just kinda reinforced my whole ""You're always gonna be a guy"" outlook I'd developed before. For a while during this time, I just wanted to be a trap, a futa, shemale, whatever you personally don't find offensive.

Now, being in High School, I'm suddenly not sure. I'm about to be a sophomore (10th grade for the few who didn't know) and had spent the whole Freshman year sort of ""adjusting"". I went by a different name, I dressed differently, and on occasion I'd even try to speak in a different voice. It felt right. I felt like my entire life before had been a lie, and somehow, some way, I had just disillusioned myself completely. I was entirely in the female mindset and I loved it. The best part? Probably 85-90% of my peers accepted it, and only a couple of individuals bullied me over it. Even with them, it felt fucking amazing. 

Probably a week and a half ago, however, I got a haircut. I'd had something between an undercut and a mohawk, and I wanted to grow it all out. I got it all buzzed off, down to half an inch everywhere. When I was still in the GreatClips, it looked alright. It wasn't overly masculine, I reminded myself, since some girls have short hair too. The problem arose when I got home. After finishing with my nightly routine, and staring myself down in the mirror due to the new look, I nearly passed out. I'd just stood up, so nothing was out of the ordinary, but this time I started fighting with myself in my head.

To put it loosely (and try to not fake diseases I don't have) it was a sort of battle between myself and my old outlook of masculinity. I won't go into the details of what happened, but I came out of the night unscathed, and somewhat more in my feminine outlook, but still with remnants of my old self. More recently, I've been less interested in... ""Helping myself out""... yet when I've been doing things, I've been relating, once more, with male characters more often.

I don’t really know where to post this, how to phrase it, and to be completely honest I don’t know entirely how I feel. I’m terrified for sure and possibly even a bit excited, maybe anxious is a better term for how I’m feeling? I’m not sure how to start this, maybe some background would help. My name is Trixie, I’m twenty-one and have transitioning using HRT since I was seventeen. I’ve always FELT utterly feminine and have believed and been told that I was passable long before I ever started hormones. I wasn’t too sure what to expect from HRT but It seemed like a necessary step in my transition. I didn’t really notice a whole lot of changes in terms of my physical appearance other than a pore less complexion and unnaturally soft skin. About a year into HRT I had my hormone regimen alerted in hopes of significant physical changes, this was all done under the direct supervision and direction of a licensed Endocrinologist. On top of a common Antiandrogen and synthetic Estrogen I was given an additional Antiandrogen and Progesterone. Initially I noticed no changes however about a month or two in I noticed I was constantly feeling like I had some sort of synthetic morning sickness, I was constantly nauseous, dizzy and ALWAYS thirsty (solely in the traditional sense unfortunately) I also noticed my interest in men waned, well let me clarify. I was plenty interested in men, I just didn’t have an urge to sleep with them. I was on hormones for two years before I met my first love interest, I was nineteen years old and nearing my second year anniversary on HRT. We spoke for eight months and eventually dated around for two months give or take. At this point in time I had no experience, I am not exaggerating when I say NO experience. I was nineteen years old when a man held my hand for the first time, nineteen when I had my first kiss and nineteen when I first had any sort of an intimate experience. I won’t dive too deep into detail but I was unable to finish the race and while my partner made a clear triumph he did express disappointment that I was unable to match his success. I chucked it all up to nerves, I eagerly tried as much as I could, pushing my boundaries, stopping short of “going all the way” Unfortunately after a lot of trial and error that seemed less and less to be the case.  Not to long after that he broke up with me, I couldn’t help but feel that my inability to Climax spearheaded his decision to end things with me. Not to long after I had a follow up with my Endocrinologist and complained about the constant feeling of nausea. It came to light that I was almost double where I needed to be at in terms of HRT levels and some major changes were to come. I was embarrassed to bring up my problems in the bedroom and ultimately decided against it since my hormones were going to be fiddle with anyways. I was taken off Progesterone completely, and one of my antiandrogens was fully removed, the remaining HRT regimen I was on was literally cut in half in hope of eradicating my faux morning sickness. I was ecstatic about the prospect of this change but unfortunately I was less then ecstatic about the results. I decided to give myself time to grieve my first relationship but also give my body time to adjust to the change. I repeated my actions of my first encounter with my then second partner, again avoiding “going all the way”, I was admittedly scared at this point. What if I did go all the way and still nothing? Would I then have to admit to myself that I’m broken. You’ve probably came to the conclusion that, that was indeed the case. (At least one of us got to come! That after all is the big issue) I very fortunately no longer felt sick, but other than that the only other thing that changed was my skin texture. I experienced for the first time the occasional blemish and random dry spot. That relationship quickly floundered and at this time I was certain my inability to climax was the issue. I very stupidly decided to take matters into my own hands and started playing with the dosage of my HRT to no avail, alas my skin suffered the consequences and my sexual appetite reaped absolutely no reward. I decided to do the only rational thing I could think of, ignore the issue completely. I’m older now and the prospect and fear of being alone if getting more prevalent. A few months ago I started seeing someone, someone I was really hoping to go the distance with. This was the end of a very long dry spell. I finally did it, at the age of twenty one I went “all the way”… and nothing. My partner expressed his disappointment, he had completed the race and was pretty bummed that I hadn’t. I was heartbroken, and well broken-broken? We tried multiple times, eleven or twelve times over the course of three weeks. Always the same result. I came clean to a partner for the first time, I told him that this has been an issue since I started HRT, that I was completely content with pleasing him and it wasn’t anything he was doing.  A week after our last encounter I was… is there a nicer way of saying dumped? I don’t believe it was solely based on my short comings ( the wordplay writes itself) but I can’t help but believe in my heart of hearts that it did play somewhat of a significant role in the decision making process. This scared the shit out of me, I’m soon to be twenty-two with no real relationship experience under my belt. I was twenty-one when I had a third date for the first time, I’ve yet to have a relationship span over two months, I can count the number of first dates I’ve had on one hand and count the number of partners I have on one hand with two fingers to spare! I’m terrified to be alone and in the state that I’m in I’m unable to participate in an adult relationship. I’ve decided to, at least for the foreseeable future stop HRT. I’m not detransitioning, I’m just halting the chemical part of my transition. I’m still Trixe, still a beautiful trans woman and still for the most part hopeful. I’m scared, scared that this won’t change a thing, scared that it will change but I’ll suffer the effects of stopping HRT, that my hair will fall out in clumps or that I will rapidly grow facial hair. I haven’t found any other trans women in my shoes, so I’m entering in this completely blind. I don’t have any one to talk to about this issue, I have a fairly large social media following but no one to really talk to. No close friends and definitely no family who will listen judgment free.

I very stupidly decided to take matters into my own hands and started playing with the dosage of my HRT to no avail, alas my skin suffered the consequences and my sexual appetite reaped absolutely no reward. I decided to do the only rational thing I could think of, ignore the issue completely. I’m older now and the prospect and fear of being alone if getting more prevalent. A few months ago I started seeing someone, someone I was really hoping to go the distance with. This was the end of a very long dry spell. I finally did it, at the age of twenty one I went “all the way”… and nothing. My partner expressed his disappointment, he had completed the race and was pretty bummed that I hadn’t. I was heartbroken, and well broken-broken? We tried multiple times, eleven or twelve times over the course of three weeks. Always the same result. I came clean to a partner for the first time, I told him that this has been an issue since I started HRT, that I was completely content with pleasing him and it wasn’t anything he was doing.  A week after our last encounter I was… is there a nicer way of saying dumped? I don’t believe it was solely based on my short comings ( the wordplay writes itself) but I can’t help but believe in my heart of hearts that it did play somewhat of a significant role in the decision making process. This scared the shit out of me, I’m soon to be twenty-two with no real relationship experience under my belt. I was twenty-one when I had a third date for the first time, I’ve yet to have a relationship span over two months, I can count the number of first dates I’ve had on one hand and count the number of partners I have on one hand with two fingers to spare! I’m terrified to be alone and in the state that I’m in I’m unable to participate in an adult relationship. I’ve decided to, at least for the foreseeable future stop HRT. I’m not detransitioning, I’m just halting the chemical part of my transition. I’m still Trixe, still a beautiful trans woman and still for the most part hopeful. I’m scared, scared that this won’t change a thing, scared that it will change but I’ll suffer the effects of stopping HRT, that my hair will fall out in clumps or that I will rapidly grow facial hair. I haven’t found any other trans women in my shoes, so I’m entering in this completely blind. I don’t have any one to talk to about this issue, I have a fairly large social media following but no one to really talk to. No close friends and definitely no family who will listen judgment free. I don’t know any other trans women at all so at this point I’m grasping at straws for support and understanding.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Transitioning off of HRT?', 'created': 1561724728.0}"

     My first step was realizing the difference between sex and gender, which I didn't understand at all at the beginning of my journey. However, I eventually realized that yes, ones body is separate from ones mind. I realized this, internalized it, and then had a better understanding of gender 

     My next and final step was actually a couple weeks ago when I had a realization that changed everything. You see, I had decided by the end of last summer that I was not trans. It was a painful thing to constantly question if I was or wasn't, and I eventually decided that I must not be trans, and that I must not be a girl. I don't think I was ever fully satisfied with this conclusion though. I don't think I was ever fully happy with this because I think some of my feelings of wanting to be a girl may have actually been real, but just that they weren't strong enough to make me want to change how I identified.

     Very recently, I had a realization. Whenever someone would say that gender is a social construct, I simply wouldn't understand them, I just couldn't understand where they were coming from, but now, I think I do. I now understand that my brain, my conciousness is not male, it's not female, it's not objectively anything really. It simply is as it is. The universe does not care how I think of myself, it'll just continue doing what it's doing, it'll keep my brain structurally the same as it's always been.

     When I realized this, everything changed. I realize now that I can both occasionally want to be a girl, and also not be a girl at the same time, because in reality I'm not any of these labels at all, I simply am how I am.

     I would also like to say that I'm not trying to convince anyone who reads this to feel different about how they identify or anything, I respect how everyone identifies, and even though I have come to this realization I still in the end identify as male myself.

I was thinking of starting to transition to female on my 18th birthday, but idk. \nThere's some other factors too. One of my other problems is my body self consciousness. I'm already chubby and kinda ugly as a dude, plus I have broad shoulders and a kinda deep voice. Idk how I'd be as a girl, I think I'd look even worse if I use femininity as a yard stick to measure my looks. \nI just see all these gorgeous trans women and I feel like I could never be like that.

""Am I trans even if some days I feel feminine?""
Yes, you are. No one has to constantly be masculine or feminine. You don't owe anyone conformity. You don't have to buy in to the mannerisms of a useless binary.

""Am I trans even if my birth name feels as valid as my chosen name?""
Yes. Names never meant much to you, anyway. Out of all the words you've identified with in your life, in your writing, in your heart, why do you have to pick one now? You do not.

""Am I trans even if I can't imagine myself on T? Getting surgery? Physically transitioning?""
Yes, for the same reason you are still trans on feminine days. Just because you are comfortable in your body, most days, does not mean you are fake. You should be proud and happy with the fact that you are, at least, comfortable with a vagina. 

I am trans. I am a boy. I am both Andrew and Alyssa. Even if I don't mind being clocked as female. Even if I never look masculine a day in my life.

1185,2019-06-30 04:36:09,c7945y,4,22,"A year ago today, I decided to transition.

Last year, the evening before Chicago Pride, I knew that I couldn’t keep it in any longer. 

In a cheap amazon shirt and some poorly done make up, staring at the image of a chubby, beard shadowed man - I confronted a painful truth: relegating myself to the stuffy, picket-fence life that I had begun to build for myself would always be a gilded cage, that keeping my true self locked away in a chest of women’s clothing in the back of my closet would slowly eat away at me for as long as I lived.

It was the night that I decided that there was a better way. A truer way. A way that I could live with. A future that I could actually look forward to. 

I set a modest goal: by Pride 2019 I would come out to just one of my closest friends. 

Here I am. One year later. The eve of Chicago Pride. Full time. Legally and socially living my true self. 

In the interim has been what was indisputably the hardest, scariest, most difficult year of my life. There were MONTHS where I told myself “just make it to the end of one. more. day.” Days where I had to fight the thoughts telling me it was too much to overcome, too difficult to triumph over. 

I’ve had to battle demons in my own mind. The demons of internalized transphobia. The demons of internalized sexism. The demons of internalized shame. 

I’ve had to fight to make my space. Throwing elbows and asserting myself in a way that I’ve never had to before. I’ve had to seriously hurt people that I love to do it. I’ve had to sacrifice relationships with family and a partner whom I loved dearly.

I’ve had to face my fears on a daily basis. The fears of discrimination, of abuse, of abandonment. I’ve had to face the reality of all three as well. 

But I overcame. I triumphed. I fought and I fought and I wanted to quit but I never did. And now I’m me.

For the first time in my 26 years on planet Earth I AM ALIVE.

I’m in a life that I own. With a *name* that I own. Bit by bit I’m beginning to finally identify my BODY as my own. 

If me one year ago could see a glimpse of the life that I have built for myself today I would be in complete and utter disbelief. It was *unfathomable* to me a year ago. 

I felt inspired to put these words down tonight, for myself, but also for those of you in the shoes that I was in on this night last year in the hopes that my story may resonate within you. 

THIS COMMUNITY, both on Reddit and out in my real world community SAVED MY LIFE. 

I love you all - happy pride!

It's something that I was not aware of at the time, and rather tried to avoid. For most of this confession, I'm putting myself in my shoes back at this time.

&amp;#x200B;

Timeline: This was around 2010-2011, where the LGBT really started the beginning stages of being accepted at schools, but before the Q was officially added I believe. 

&amp;#x200B;

Premise: I grew up being called gay by bullies and the likes most of my childhood, because I wasn't as inherently masculine as the other boys. This was before I even understood sexuality. But nonetheless, being called all kinds of stuff put me in a very repressed mindset, and I projected a lot following middle school, and into high school. 

Situation: There was this schoolmate in high school and I saw them on occasion in the hallway. I went to a performing arts high school, so it was way further ahead in terms. of LGBTQ acceptance. So me being willfully detached from identity, I assumed they were a cis boy, but gay. But one day, they came in dressed up. A simple black dress, heels, but no detailed or heavy  makeup look. I believe they had light nude lipstick on, and earrings.  They were sitting with their cis female friend. And our school was accepting of people but that was still a foreign concept. Now looking back, I don't know if they were crossdressing, or if they were trans. I simply didn't know. But still.. I saw them. It caught me off guard. They were sitting with their Cis girl friend in the spot they always did before school started for the day. People would walk by and comment but not at them, just with their own friends but it was loud enough for both of them to hear. Most of it was mocking to varying extents. I could tell they were starting to feel uncomfortable, and their cis girl friend was drawing their attention back to her so they wouldn't have a panic attack. Cis girl friend directed her friends eyes back to hers, to focus. But their eyes wandered and hit my direction. And I just stared. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to add, I naturally have a resting bitch face that I cant help. And I think it came off intimidating at the time. Because at the time I'm a black AMAB and I dressed hella masculine at the time and projected such. I always projected anger, or hype bro energy to keep from being angry. But the stare wasn't intended to be a bad thing. I was just attracted to them. Like I'm pretty sure my egg cracked at that moment. There were several times it could've cracked growing up, but mix being just a young kid, and later being a repressed teen, I swept that all under the rug.  Back to this individual. They were fucking gorgeous. I felt all kinds of shit. The kind of stuff I would feel about cis women at the time, when I had a crush. The heart fluttering. Dry mouth because I was nervous. It was a legitimate off-guard moment, and I let it down, and only the surface of what I was feeling could show. I was confused, and in that moment, all kinds of shit started flowing back:

\- The time I wanted to be Sailor Moon for Halloween and my bio-dad called me a faggot and forced me to be Ghostface instead. Jealous of all my female classmates. 

\- The time I asked for more pink and lighter colored t-shirts, and the authority figures in my life telling me I don't want that.

\- And all the times I was called gay or sissy in middle school. Every day. Before I even expressed sexuality..

&amp;#x200B;

All of it came back. I don't know how long I stared but they both eventually just started and got up and walked away. Me staring and the looks other people gave was most likely too much. All I could do was. stare, and when I really came back to, my friends nearby were laughing, about what they saw. I didn't talk to them much the whole day, but I had to revert back to hiding it all. It took a few days to put all of it back in so I could go back to being a toxic trash bin. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to 2014. 3 years after. we graduated; When I officially could not hold much of it in anymore without experimenting and alleviating some of the dysphoria. It all came back to me, after not thinking about it for years. One of my best friends, a cis female, was open about it. She was the first person I told everything to. And she never judged me. Amongst several other things over the course of days after coming out to her,  I thought I was just telling a basic ass account of high school life but I was drunk as fuck and cried my eyes out about it because I realized how hurtful even just a STARE can be. I felt like shit. They probably didn't know that I wished I was their friend that they came out to, or just a friend in general.  I can't find them. Not on facebook, not in my yearbook, nothing. Nowhere.  
I knew their name at the time, but I can't find a trace and it fucks with me because sometimes it feels like they weren't really there, but I know that's not the case. I just have to keep searching. 

&amp;#x200B;

So to this person, in the very small off chance that you're in this subreddit, and you can put all these pieces together:

**I am truly sorry. I wish I was as brave as you at the time. I still wish I was. I'm not there yet. But I could've been there for you. Even if I used my masculinity at the time to make sure no one fucked with you. You were so beautiful. You had a smile that I hadn't previously seen on you all the times I walked past you and your friends' chilling spot before school.** 

**I wish I could've encouraged you or complimented you. I wish I could've asked you out.. I wish I could've just been there, even as a friend. I wish you could've taught me about identity sooner. I wish I knew I was going to crack like this. I wish I wasn't so afraid of my family and friends, and the repercussions of coming out in my situation. I don't know if you've been through family abuse. But I should've risked mine to let you know you're not alone. The one time I stare without speaking my mind, was the worst time to not do so. You played a part in me finding myself. If you see this, I hope you know that, and I hope you can forgive me.**

After that the sleepovers stopped and we became less close. It really hurt me because I thought they would be excepting.  

I got into a serious relationship with a male soon after and about a year later at 17, I moved in with him. (My family was displaced and living with my grandparents, my mom allowed me to live with him with contingencies) He had talked about marrying me and he was my first great love. Then he allowed his best friend to move in. His best friend happened to be my date rapist. I told him this and he didn't believe me. I stupidly stayed with him as he promised nothing would happen. His friend however got angry with me all the time and ended up getting in my face violently yelling. My boyfriend was right there and did nothing. That's when I finally left. 

Not even two weeks later I am going to senior grad night and I see Tee getting out of my ex's car. I was hurt to say the least, Tee and I weren't close but they did know about what had happened with my ex, and why I left. I confronted Tee and they claimed it was nothing. A year later they were married. 

Now I'm getting married next year and over all that happened and I reached out to Tee through Instagram. We have been lightly talking when Tee said they were depressed so I wanted to help as much as I could. We talked almost every day. Only a few weeks later they came out as transgender female to male. After that Tee hasn't talked to me. 

I really want to stay in touch and become friends again but I'm not sure if I should reach out again or how. I'm also having a hard time navigating through pronouns and the name change and my own feelings. I feel selfish to have any feelings about it at all but all of our friendship Tee was a she, now that he's a he I feel more hurt that they distanced themselves after I came out. I want to make clear I am in full support of anyone in the LGBT community.

Verse 1
/////////

Mommy’s touch, first contact with the world. Pure of heart from the start, I was an innocent baby girl.

My little baby eyes were closed, completely free of judgement. Wrapped around my mothers arms, I truly know I am human.

A single tear of happiness, rolls down her pretty cheek.
She worked so hard, and now she’s feeling weak

After all this pain, and after all this joy.
Congratulations, it’s a beautiful baby boy.

A gentle kiss now, this must be from daddy. “Oh my beautiful son, I’ll promise, to keep you healthy”.

“You’ll have a courageous heart, The will to face your fears. And to little baby me, this was gibberish to my ears.

“We’ll get him toys, paint his room blue. And we’ll even have to tie his shoes.”

And little me, couldn’t even confess.
That daddy I’m not like the rest.

////////////
Chorus:
////////////

Couldn’t try or even talk.
To explain the nature of my heart 
I can’t speak, Or can’t express.
The pain that would make my life a mess
A heart of gold, so i’ve been told. 
A boy that doesn’t quite fit the mold
***
So i’ve been told

\\\\\\\\\\\\
Verse 2
////////////

Baby girl now six years old, at school where she’s enrolled.

She got picked on by other boys, for playing with girly toys.

Feeling hurt deep down inside, cause she hates having to hide.

Her true self feeling ashamed, about saying her own damn name.

Hating her boyish clothes, uncomfortable I suppose

Just wanting to wear a dress, without no one to impress.

Little me, couldn’t understand.
Trying to find who I really am

A boy who’ll love, a boy who’ll cry.
A girl who’s life would be all lies.

***
To hide...

////////////
Chorus:
////////////

Couldn’t try or even talk.
To explain the nature of my heart 
I can’t speak, Or can’t express.
The pain that would make my life a mess
A heart of gold, so i’ve been told. 
A boy that doesn’t quite fit the mold
***
So i’ve been told

////////////
Verse 3
///////////

Little girl now all grown up, still playing with her makeup.

Still unsure of this whole mess, still envious of her mom’s dress.

No she doesn’t have a clue, No one told her what to do.

To fix her fucking brain, to no longer feel pain.

All she wants is to feel love, for the life she keeps dreaming of.

Mom and dad don’t be ashamed, for something I overcame

It’s my life i’m fighting for, all the signs I can’t ignore.
...

\\\\\\\\\\\
Bridge:
///////////

Please just listen to what I’m saying
Even if at first glance, it sounds insane
Who I am inside my brain
Doesn’t really fit my name
I’m completely done, playing these games
Hey dad i’ve got something to explain

////////////
Chorus:
////////////

Now when I try to talk.
To explain the nature of my heart 
I can speak, I can express.
I went and bought myself a dress.
My heart of gold so i’ve been told,
A girl that doesn’t quite fit the mold
...
So i’ve been told.

Do you have things that you sometimes crave and feel amazing physically, but always end up being triggering? For me, it’s being penetrated. Sometimes I just really crave it and want it, I’m not sure why, it never ends well. I haven’t been sexually active for too long, my dysphoria and other issues prevented me from perusing a sexual relationship with a woman for a long time. I never asked my previous gf to penetrate me, infact it was a hard boundary for me. My new gf is amazing and sex with her is out of this world, so I thought I’d give it a try. I have penetrated myself with toys during masturbation, and while it was mildly triggering I figured doing it with my gf might somehow be different? 

It was different. It was worse. But then in someways better.


We have a strap on and a couple dildos to go with it, very rarely used as she doesn’t really love being penetrated either. very occasionally she’ll ask for the smallest one we have and grind on it on me, but that’s rare, if she wants to grind she usually just straddles me and grinds her clit on my dick. Which is not really relevant to this, I’m just stalling...
 

Anyway, I asked her to use the strap on (and medium sized dildo) on me a few nights ago. I was just really craving it. She did, she was gentle and sweet until I asked for it less gentle and less sweet. She worked my dick with her hand while she fucked me, and during the experience everything was fine. It felt amazing, and I had and incredible orgasm. Typically during masturbation where I penetrate myself this is where I start to come down and get all kinds of negative feelings. This time was no different. I didn’t want to seem ‘weak’ so I tried to push through, I asked if I could use the strap on on her, she said yes.

This is where I feel like a huge asshole. She was so gentle and sweet when she started with me, I was less so. Maybe in my head I thought I could prove I was man enough for her if I fucked her hard enough. She took it for a bit, and then asked me to stop and told me I was hurting her. I felt terrible. It all came crashing in, the shame of getting off while being penetrated/fucked by her. And then not even being able to do her right. 

I pretty much lost it, I wound up crying/bawling myself to sleep. She was really sweet, held and tried to comfort me. Which itself was a bit of a mind fuck. It was nice being in her arms but didn’t exactly help me feel manly (I know there isn’t anything wrong with crying, but in that moment it was hard) 

We had a good talk the morning after, I explained my feeling about everything that happened, she listened and accepted my apology for the way I behaved when I hurt her. She was really understanding and were still in a good place. This feels like something I should talk to my therapist about, and I will. I just find it weird that I crave it occasionally, love it during the act but then feel nothing but shame and regret afterwards.

Okay so to the questions:

1. I read that its not uncommon for nb people to choose to go by gendered pronouns like he/him instead of they/them. Can i ask to those of you that choose to do so, and to those that don't, what if any is your reasoning?

2. How often do yall think about your gender expression? For example, as a guy im constantly policing my own language and thought processes to tamp down the inherent sexist thoughts i was raised on as a dude, and i know my girl friends do the same from the other way, but how do yall handle things like that?

3. How do you define your attraction? Since gay/lesbian is same sex attraction, bi is same and other, etc, how would you define a relationship with a binary person? 

4. What, if any, story tropes have you read about nb people that you really didnt like? Any that you really did? Anything I could include in the story to make thia character's life more relatable/recognizable as a non-binary experience?

14,2019-06-20 06:48:24,c2soir,12,4,"hi. before reading this, please remember to be very critical and skeptical of me. i want some harsh opinions. this is a struggle for me and i want a firm yes or no, not ""everyone is valid"" (which, of course, everyone is, but you get the idea).

i am 18. i have had gender dysphoria all my life, in ways i was too young to begin to understand until about age 11. i came out as trans male when i was 12. i socially transitioned that same year. when i was 13, i began to question myself. i dont know what kicked it off, its been too long to remember. i came out as agender at age 13, which my parents were confused by but ok with. i went by a gender-neutral name, but everyone just took me for a girl, called me she/her, etc. this made me massively dysphoric, and i retreated back to presenting as male, using a male name, and using he/him.

from about... age 15 on, i began telling myself i would come out as nonbinary after i got sexual reassignment surgery (which yes i still do want). at age 17, i began thinking about it more and more. it started nagging at me. i hesitantly asked my 3 closest friends to use they/them pronouns for me and call me a shortened, gender-neutral version of my legal (male) name. they agreed. i started T about 4 months ago.

i have been very, VERY hesitant to claim the label of nonbinary/agender for multiple reasons. my friends are very iffy about the validity of nb people and i honestly just feel stupid talking to them about it. one of them told me i am just a gnc man, but someone else pointed out i do nothing that would be considered gnc for men (aside from keep stuffed animals, though im no pillar of masculinity either). i also feel like i am appropriating the label of nonbinary. i know some dysphoric nb people who have been out for longer and i feel like im stepping on toes here, especially because they have such dysphoria about it. 

in case you are interested in my dysphoria... i have a lot of dysphoria about my genitals, had top surgery at age 16 cuz of dysphoria, and am dysphoric about my lack of body hair. i also have what i would call ""external dysphoria"" about my hips, voice, and height. what i mean by ""external dysphoria"" is that i dont mind them in and of themselves, but the fact people can use those clues to tell i am AFAB makes me super dysphoric because i dont want to be seen as female ever. being called she/her gives me gender dysphoria no matter the circumstance, being called he/him is fine and i dont mind, being called they/them is heavily preferred and gives me ""gender euphoria"".


TL;DR: basically, being called...
female= horrible, awful, cant stand
male= okay, i dont mind, i could live like this
neither= best, preferred, ideal

16,2019-06-20 15:13:25,c2x8a5,1,3,"Hello friends 🍄

Yesterday, after about a year and a half (but also like lifetime??) of fighting with myself, I finally came out as NB. I did it in a casual way as that's what felt right to me. Literally just a picture of me smiling that has my name and pronouns, but it felt so right and good and that's all I wanted it to be. SOOOOO many of my amazing friends showed support, 10/10 said ""well duh!!"" (In a nice way, it was very comforting!) 
Well, I've brought it up the idea of NB to my parents several times, and every time we discuss it they mock it HARD COREEEE. My parents aren't bad people, I think they're maybe just old. Anyway, my mom saw my post (we don't live together) and called me screaming and crying and saying she couldn't believe I didn't have a sit down talk and all that with them. I apologized for hurting her feelings, but every time I tried to explain why I felt uncomfortable she got more upset and said she couldn't believe I was making her feel bad about this and all that. I'm sorry I'm not very good at explaining things, I half tuned out because it was just so....sad. so many people in my life are happy for me and today is my first day being out as NB, and I feel like myself and comfy in my identity for the first time. 
Anyway, it's hard because after my parents reaction I sort of just want to go ""haha I guess it was a phase!!!"" Even though it's not and it doesn't feel that way at all. No one in my life has made it seem like a burden except my parents, and that hurts like a motherfucker.

I'm here from [Winning Writers’](https://winningwriters.com/), a resource website for writers. Part of our mission is to find and promote voices and themes underrepresented in publishing, including (but of course not limited to) racial, cultural, national, religious, gender/sexual identity, body positive, neurodiverse, and [dis]abled. We are interested primarily in the representation of the voices/themes in the poetry, rather than the identity of the writer. 

Right now we're running a writing contest with diversity at its heart. [The North Street Book Prize](https://winningwriters.com/our-contests/north-street-book-prize) for self-published books offers a grand prize of $3,000, six second prizes of $1,000 each, and six honorable mentions of $250 each, as well as marketing consultation and other prizes for grand- and second-prize winners. Categories include mainstream/literary fiction, genre fiction, creative nonfiction and memoir, poetry, children’s picture books, and graphic narrative. Excerpts and critiques of all winning entries will be published at winningwriters.com. The contest is international and the deadline is June 30. A reading fee of $60 funds our judging process. The North Street Book Prize is listed on [Poets &amp; Writers](https://www.pw.org/writing_contests/north_street_book_prize)’s “Grants &amp; Awards” page as a reputable contest.

Hello! My name is Clover. I'm bi-gender, assigned male at birth. So, I guess I'm also Bryan.

I like my male body, and feel blessed. But for years I've suppressed another part of me out of fear and shame. This other part of me is distinct and has a very gentle, soothing, feminine energy. Without knowing it, this other part of me would break through and express herself in different ways. I've always pretended to be a girl online when playing MMORPGs, or in general just typing to people. It got so extreme that I've been in committed relationships with men who genuinely fell in love with this other part of me, thinking that I'm a woman irl. It also got to the point that whenever my hands would even touch a keyboard or a phone, I'd take on this other more feminine side.

I finally reached a point where I couldn't take it anymore. I realized I had been lying to myself and that I'm just not who I thought I was. I admitted to myself there's a woman inside of me, and came out to my therapist. Since then I've come up with a female name(Clover), changed my gender identity, and have slowly tried nurturing this other side of myself. I'm also an artist and have done some artwork of Clover, I'll post some of it below.

A point that this brings up. How do you all Identify yourselves? The reason I feel I'm bi-gender is because there are two distinct personas that I switch between to express two distinct sides of myself. When you talk about your other ""persona"" do you refer to them in the third person(as if they were another person) or do you simply refer to them with ""me, myself"" pronouns? I'm trying very hard to NOT sound crazy to people. But this is such a strange and confusing gender identity, that I worry all the time I've lost it and am finally going crazy.  
Anyways, thanks so much for listening. Any help. love, allies, words of support or anything at all would help. I feel so scared and vulnerable right now. More than I ever have. I could really use friends.

But I'm not sure, the more I think about gender and the more I learn means I just end up feeling more confused than anything.  I look in the mirror at this AMAB, very masculine body of mine and wonder what I'd look like as a woman.  And then I realize I don't hate the male body that I have.  Its fine, its attractive, its got a lot of good qualities.  I like having a dick too.  And so then I stop wondering what I'd look like as a woman.  

Then I wonder what I'd feel like as a woman.  What would it feel like to be a woman who is with other women?  What would it feel like to be a woman with a woman?  And then I flip back in my head and I'm like, ""I'm a man and I wanna have sex with her as a man"".  I wanna use my dick to fuck her and I want her to suck it.  

And I'm just like, so weirdly conflicted between wanting to be sometimes man and sometimes woman.  I like being a man in my day-to-day life.  I have rarely, if ever, wondered what it would be like to be a woman out in the streets.  I like being seen as a man, I take photos with my cousins and dress up in masculine ways.  Sometimes I dress more gender-neutral, but I scoff at the idea of wearing a dress or makeup.  

I don't like the idea of medically transitioning and growing breasts.  I don't like the idea of losing my ""masc"" so to speak.  I like it and I want to keep it.  I don't like female pronouns (had some friends try them for a while on me and I often have this disconnect when they refer to me as ""she"" like its not about me).  So here I've been just sort of idling by as a regular old man for the past half year or so since I've come to terms with ""nonbinary"" as a label for myself.  And the only thing I can say is that I don't know what I want.  Even still, I don't know what I want.

I can't relate to many transwomen's stories, but I relate a lot to Ash Hardell.  I relate a lot to Jeffree Marsh. 
Sometimes when I imagine myself as having been born a ciswoman, I end up thinking I'd like to be transmasculine.  And I have no idea why I can come to that conclusion about myself.  My dysphoria isn't killing me inside like it did once I first took the label ""trans"" onto myself.  It's just sorta like I'm ""aware"" of it without suffering from anything.  

Its hard to tell exactly what I am or who I want to be anymore.  When I picture myself, ""What would I like to look like in 10 years.""  I picture a man with long hair, feminine glasses, a beard, and smiling at a friend.  I don't picture myself as ""woman"".  Not really.  Its as though being either gender as we know and expect them to be is becoming less of a possibility for me.  And its a weird feeling because I've lived for so long as ""man"" that I just sort of default to it, while also sometimes waking up and feeling ""woman"".

Straight to the point, do these feelings sound like dysphoria? The more I read about what dysphoria feels like, the more I feel like maybe I've had some experience with it. It's strange, because I wouldn't consider myself trans. I have some issues with how women are expected to look, dress, and act, but I don't feel discomfort in my actual body.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never liked dressing traditionally feminine--wearing a dress and heels with a nice sweater, or even a pantsuit with a feminine cut. Formal occasions weren't great for me, especially as I got older and realized I could wear suits (but didn't because of my parents), and by the time I was 16 or so, really couldn't stand wearing dresses, or even some of the also feminine alternatives offered to me (jumpsuits, for example). Part of that was because I felt bad about not standing up for myself, but the other part was that I felt gross. Like, I felt like I was too big and too masculine to be wearing a dress--same with whatever basic black flats I had on at the time. I don't shave my legs, but I also hated the sight of my hairy legs coming out the bottom of the dress...it just wasn't right. I didn't really like having my picture taken because it would always be the worst version of myself staring back at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It also happened with my hair; It took me a long time to get the courage to cut my hair when I was younger. Until I buzzed it all off, I couldn't stand to touch it very much. I pulled it back and wore hats as often as I could get away with it (my mom always insisted I not wear a hat too often because it would make my hair fall out). Another reason I hated formal occasions was because I would be expected to make my hair look nice, which of course meant ""feminine"". People would fawn over how long and pretty it was. The more people paid attention to it, the more I wanted to pull it back and put on a hat. One of the hardest things was resisting the urge to just cut it off whenever I was home alone--I waited until I graduated, at my mother's request.

&amp;#x200B;

This might sound really weird, and this is theoretical, I'm putting feelers out there for info so maybe this is stupid question... but I recently learned that trans guys actually experience changes down there and the clit grows into what looks like a penis. What interested me more was that these changes are among the first to happen. I'm wondering if I could take T for a week or two, get the bottom growth I seek before anything like hair/voice set in, and get off T while still enjoying some sort of benefit to my new bottom growth after my hormones return to their normal levels. Would I get enough growth in the first couple weeks for it to look obvious from a distance? would it still get erect?

  
And no, this isn't some clit-enlargement fetish, I don't want to pump.

&amp;#x200B;

""Why do you want to go on T then go off it?""

I've been struggling with my gender identity, I'm already kind of androgynous in terms of expression (I'm a bit femme in terms of body-type), I look like a tomboy. Sometimes I feel like a sexy sexy girl, and sometimes I feel like a handsome cute boy who wears sweaters and glasses, like a more delicate Jon Watson. I glimpsed myself in the mirror once when my shirt was off, and the way my neck was turned seemed very masculine and I was like ""wow... I'm kinda hot"". And it's moments like that when I consider trying out transitioning.

I don't think I need hormone therapy or anything cause I'm still questioning and this is all very theoretical still (I haven't even decided to get a therapist yet)... I think I'm more nonbinary or genderfluid, if I'm even that... sometimes I think I'm just a boyish cis girl. 

I've held a dildo to myself and while it felt good, like scary good, I don't like the idea of things hanging down there, it's why I don't have a lot of bottom dysphoria, I got the ""compact"" package, and right now I'm eyeing that clit as a win-win. I get a dick, but it's not huge and expensive, and I don't have to jump into the other changes from T until I decide I'm ready. 

&amp;#x200B;

My problem with T is the changes that come with it, the hair growth, the hair loss, the voice, I don't want that, at least I don't think I do. Ideally I'd be one of those boys who can't grow a beard or body hair and whose voice barely cracks. I feel like the changes I want are too small for testosterone aside from the bottom growth.

I don't know what dysphoria feels like for most people, but for me I have three different kinds. 

one. (pronouns, and maybe my name?)... I don't feel it right away, it slowly builds and builds till I can't keep it in anymore. I just start crying the next time I feel safe, and if I'm in public I'm really really quiet. I will only answer yes or no questions. 

two. (appearance)... this one I feel right away. I'm a morning person, so I wake-up happy, making it so there is a time frame that I need to put on make-up, otherwise I just turn into a sad sack and won't have the will power to put any on later, or do anything practical.

three. (sex organs)... I feel a detachment from them like they are not mine, and never have been, it's the same feeling that I think any person would get if there was a tile pattern but it was messed up by one tile. Just ""that's not suppose to be there, it needs to be fixed, now"". it also gives me restrictions in clothing. in my mind at least, body parts should not move unless directly told to by me, the circumstances don't matter, they just shouldn't.

52,2019-06-09 14:11:18,bykl08,4,10,"Hello my fellow fabulous humans! Firstly, thanks to everyone who has engaged in my prior posts (which were quite depressing at times) - it is because of your positive reinforcement I am now more than comfortable being and presenting the genderqueer identidty I feel! As they say where I live Wales, Diolch yn fawr Iawn Pawb!

Anyway, onto the crux of this post. It occurs to me that a lot of the 'trouble' and confusion I had around my Gender identity was that there honestly isnt much information on anything past the LGBT of the the LGBTQ+ community. When I was growing up and could feel that I didnt belong being labled a 'boy' but at the same time I also didnt feel like being a 'girl' I was just left confused - was it a phase? Was it normal? Was my lack of wanting to feel masculine part of being not straight? And would I even be allowed to present feminine when I also fancied girls? That confusion and isolation created a lot of confusion and self hatred for me - as I know it has for many others.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel a lot of that could have been curbed by there being a lot more freely available information on people who identify as Genderqueer. Equally for cis people who have never heard of Genderqueer the more open and public the information is the less likely we are to be met with confusion or derision. As such I feel a Genderqueer Awerness Day might be a good thing.

There is of course the Non-Binary People's Day every year on July 14th but I myself would consider myself non-binary as a secondary thing, to be honest I only really use it when Im explaining what Genderqueer is (if that makes sense?). I would rather see another day, alongside Non-Binary People's Day, that specifically focuses on people who Identify as Genderquuer so this specific self identification can be celebrated and have its awerness spread.

I met a gay guy last year, and we’ve become really good friends. When I first saw him I was really taken, but I realised he was gay, and I’m usually good at just turning off that kind of thing when I realise someone’s unavailable, so I turned it off. “I can appreciate women who are pretty,” he said. “Like I think you’re really cute.” He calls me cute when we’re high, sometimes. Probably just the drugs talking. I like to hear it either way.

Much later on, I came out to him as non binary - more, he figured it out. God, he took it well; made a real effort to be cool about it, once he got through his apologies.

I’m starting to realise I didn’t really manage to turn off my crush on him, and last week we shared a bed after getting home drunk from a night clubbing, and in the morning as he slept I watched the rising and falling slope of his shoulders down to his waist and thought, “This is so unfair.”

I had to take my binder off as we slept, and in the morning when I put it back on I thought, “I don’t want to do this - I don’t want to bind - I don’t want to bind just to walk to do the few minute walk to my apartment, but I don’t want anyone to see my chest.”

I’m starting to wonder if I should begin a medical transition. When I was a teenager, that seemed urgent, then it took a back seat, for reasons I don’t really remember. Time, fear, or the fucking effort of it, maybe. But I don’t know what I want. I don’t know what I want separated from other people. I don’t want to come out to the guys at work, on my Facebook, my digital footprint wiped over unsuccessfully like rocks on the beach as the tide comes in. I don’t want that awkward first stage of transition. Dating would be even more of a nightmare than it already is.

But I don’t want this personhood, either.

God, he took it well; made a real effort to be cool about it, once he got through his apologies.\n\nI’m starting to realise I didn’t really manage to turn off my crush on him, and last week we shared a bed after getting home drunk from a night clubbing, and in the morning as he slept I watched the rising and falling slope of his shoulders down to his waist and thought, “This is so unfair.”\n\nI had to take my binder off as we slept, and in the morning when I put it back on I thought, “I don’t want to do this - I don’t want to bind - I don’t want to bind just to walk to do the few minute walk to my apartment, but I don’t want anyone to see my chest.”\n\nI’m starting to wonder if I should begin a medical transition. When I was a teenager, that seemed urgent, then it took a back seat, for reasons I don’t really remember. Time, fear, or the fucking effort of it, maybe. But I don’t know what I want. I don’t know what I want separated from other people. I don’t want to come out to the guys at work, on my Facebook, my digital footprint wiped over unsuccessfully like rocks on the beach as the tide comes in. I don’t want that awkward first stage of transition. Dating would be even more of a nightmare than it already is.\n\nBut I don’t want this personhood, either.\n\nI’ll probably delete this post in the morning. I just had to get this out of my head and I’d like and comments, similar stories or struggles, if you have the time.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'A Bit of Heartache', 'created': 1560323531.0}"

I've hated nail polish and makeup (excluding a strange eye shadow phase) I also gravitated to more genderless things as a child. I never really went through a princess phase or anything. 

family members have tried to get me to be more girly but it's never worked and just made me more uncomfortable. 
I've always felt more comfortable in leggings and loose shirts and so thats all I wear. 
I've also never been a huge fan of my chest, like I understand that I have boobs (they are small) but have never really cared for them. recently I started wearing singlets and loose tshirts, I look flat chested. I feel more me when I do that. I've also taken a liking to the name alex as I love how it's not gendered. my name is pretty gendered (will not tell you what it is as its pretty uncommon)
I also have times where I think about having a penis but then the feeling completely fades. 

I like she/her pronouns or they/them pronouns, but hate he/him pronouns. 

most of the time I do not feel like a boy but I also do not feel like a girl.

My first thought was - ""Oh no, here we go again.""

I said I wanted to talk to her in person about it later, and text was a terrible way to have The Talk.


Today we talked and she wants to pass more androgynously so we went on Amazon and found a couple binders and she's going to talk to her hair stylist (also queer) about what she can do there.

I am extremely anxious about it and trying to get past feelings of shame about all of it. I want to explore and experiment with what feels right (specifically dressing/behaving as a female, but not in public) but I want my wife to be on board with me. She is bisexual and a very accepting person so I'm not really afraid of her not accepting it. 

I guess my concern is that I won't express myself well especially since I don't fully know what it means for me yet either. Also I want her to know that I am still fully attracted and devoted to her, regardless of what I'm founding out about myself. 

Does anyone have advice or tips for this situation?

Thanks in advance!

16,2019-06-03 22:11:12,bwgsig,2,8,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to lay out my situation and am curious about opinions. Sorry this will probably be very long because I want to get everything out there. I'm currently thinking about seeing a counselor because I've been feeling kinda confused lately. I've always been interested in CD/sissy porn since I was a tween, the latter of which I know this community finds disrespectful. I believe it to be a fetish currently and previously, but crossdressing is a little bit more than just that I feel since it's more of a lifestyle. This has always been the porn that has fascinated me the most, I like the feminization aspects of it and the idea of transformation. I've just always found the idea of being able to switch back and forth between genders to be really hot and fun. I remember when my mom told me that I was a boy and I was disappointed because I wanted to be like her. She was my idol and my dad wasn't as emotionally in touch with us as children. However, I never had much of a problem being a boy and I did boy things and enjoyed them. I can't say I really wanted to do girly things growing up or be a girl but I do remember one time my sister and her friend put some jewelry on me with a game they were playing. 

So fast forward to now and I am finally living alone. I've always had urges to crossdress and I finally cracked and started exploring that about a month ago or so. I find it really fun and like how it feels. However I start to feel kinda stressed and worried if I do it for long periods, like dressing up all day at home. I'm not sure if the stress is dysphoria or just feeling like I need to spend more time as a guy because I've been overindulging quite a bit since I've started. The main source of conflict I feel for me is that I've been jealous of girls in how they are able to be vulnerable, talk about anything with their friends, generally have more social support, get to wear sexy outfits, and generally have an easier go of it at dating and sex. I still haven't had sex or a gf and that's been a big source of angst and frustration. I'm fairly passive and have always had trouble approaching and leading girls. Perhaps it will get better with practice but I'm still in my mid twenties and still don't feel comfortable. I do feel like it'd be easier to be a girl in that way and socially, and my dating and social life are my biggest sources of frustration and I know they'd give me the most happiness. 

Just recently I went on a trip with family and my mom and sister used that gender swap feature on snapchat, and it seemed to really intrigue my mom how she looked as a man and my sister didn't like herself as a man. When they saw what I looked like as a girl my mom said I looked pretty and my sister said I couldn't make a prettier girl than her after she saw my picture. Since I've started crossdressing and getting into sissy stuff I feel like it's escalated fairly quickly, probably because I've held it in for so many years. I ended up trying some things I thought I never would do even a couple months ago. I tried a little makeup and made a grindr and am considering experimenting with other CDs and men so that I get to experience what it's like to 'have sex like a woman.' Which I know there is no universal way they have sex but just to see how it feels and so it validates my feminine side. I've never actually been interested in men before so that's what makes me feel like it's just a fetish. I'd like to see what it's like to go out to a LGBT bar dressed up because I think it'd be fun. I've also considered that I might be gender fluid. I've been getting a lot of attention on grindr and guys liking my pictures and thinking I look good. It definitely feels good to get attention in that way because typically most guys don't get that kind of attention from girls. 

I've also noticed that after I cum from masturbation the desire starts to go away, which further makes me think it's just a fetish. However, today I still ended up dressing. I just recently read about something called Nonhomosexual Autogynephilic Transsexualism and I can relate to the concept of autogynephilia but I'm not sure what this sub's opinion of it is and if it's a real thing. I never really thought I was trans growing up but I have considered it. I’ve actually considered making my body more fem more the time being, which is weird because I’ve always wanted to be muscular. 

Thanks for reading and sorry it's so long. I'm just concerned because lately I've been getting addicted to crossdressing and sissy stuff and I'm sure I have a porn addiction, but I believe the desires will always be there. I'd just like a relationship with a girl but I doubt she'd be ok with this side of myself unless she was bisexual possibly. If I do get deeper and deeper into this stuff, sleep with guys, and really enjoy the whole lifestyle I feel like it could lead to transitioning somehow possibly. But that would be like making your fetish your entire life if you didn't truly think you were a girl and I'm sure I'd regret it and I don't think I'd be able to deal with everything that goes into transitioning anyway.

I’m a female (14), and have been one ever since birth. Life’s been normal for me in terms of gender... until now that is.

For the past 4 days my gender has been... strange. I feel more masculine all of a sudden. I also still feel a bit feminine and it changes a lot through the day, somewhat adding a little stress to my life, which is normal because I have severe anxiety and literally anything can scare me, haha.

When I was younger, I did wonder what it was like as a boy. Hell I even wanted to turn into one for a day to see what it’s like. But I assumed this was normal behavior for kids my age and gender so I didn’t question it. It faded away and came back sometimes, but again, didn’t assume anything was wrong. I added this paragraph here just in case it helps.

Anyways, back to present day: I feel more masculine than feminine often. To be honest, I really do wanna be a guy. I wanna dress as one, look like one, and be called the pronouns. But at the same time I also wanna be a girl. My body feels wrong sometimes and it bothers me.

Now I do wanna put makeup on to look more masculine. I really do! Problem is my mom knows that I am not a fan of makeup. I have tried two times recently but I rushed because even though my mom was gone and probably wouldn’t walk in on me putting some on I still feared of when she’d come back. I want to put on the makeup and not be questioned about it, but as I’ve stated before: Mom knows I’m not a makeup fan. And she does not know that I’ve been struggling with my gender identity lately. (Or knows my sexuality either, which is pan/bi asexual if you were curious.) My family isn’t seriously religious or anything, it’s just anxiety.

So could you guys maybe help me with my gender crisis? I did originally ask on r/genderqueer but my post got deleted for some weird reason so I came to this sub next because I think I am genderfluid. Thank you for reading my ramble!

56,2019-06-08 02:03:10,by2s8v,1,9,"So.. I used to make fun of gender-fluid people because I didn’t understand at all. I thought that doesn’t make sense whatsoever. My ex of a week ago said “maybe you’re gender-fluid OP.” I was confused. 

When I was about 4 years old I would tuck my penis in and be like “mommy look, I’m a girl!” My little sister wasn’t born yet. How the fuck would I know what a girls anatomy looks like? I would play house with my cousins but sometimes I would would want to be the girl dog (or whatever animal we were pretending to be) to give birth to the little ones. Weird. 

At around 12 I had to move into my grandads house with my mom and sister because my parents got a divorce. 

One day, I don’t know why, I had this idea “I wonder what a dress feels like!” So I put on a dress, stockings, heels.. It felt good. I used to run home from the bus so I could dress up. I knew it was wrong. I knew it wasn’t what boys should do. I did it anyway. 

One of the first orgasms I ever had was from acting like I was being bent over the bed and being fucked. Why the hell would I think that way? At 13? With no other sexual interaction whatsoever? That’s where it started. 

I would dress up every chance I got and then.. I just kinda stopped.. I saw some girls and I was like damn... They’re hot. I started dating girls and having a great time, completely disregarding what has been going on. 

I was having a great time and then there was a knock at the door. “Hey! You forget about me?” 

It was around 20 when that happened. I would only let that side out every now and then. In secret. 

The divide took place. I am now two people in one body. I am OP but there is also op. I am two separate identities in one. 

I don’t know if I’m gender fluid. I am not unhappy with my current body. I am not unhappy that I have a penis and enjoy fucking women but I do love the thought of being a woman and taking dick.

I used to make fun of gender-fluid people because I didn’t understand at all. I thought that doesn’t make sense whatsoever. My ex of a week ago said “maybe you’re gender-fluid OP.” I was confused. \n\nWhen I was about 4 years old I would tuck my penis in and be like “mommy look, I’m a girl!” My little sister wasn’t born yet. How the fuck would I know what a girls anatomy looks like? I would play house with my cousins but sometimes I would would want to be the girl dog (or whatever animal we were pretending to be) to give birth to the little ones. Weird. \n\nAt around 12 I had to move into my grandads house with my mom and sister because my parents got a divorce. \n\nOne day, I don’t know why, I had this idea “I wonder what a dress feels like!” So I put on a dress, stockings, heels.. It felt good. I used to run home from the bus so I could dress up. I knew it was wrong. I knew it wasn’t what boys should do. I did it anyway. \n\nOne of the first orgasms I ever had was from acting like I was being bent over the bed and being fucked. Why the hell would I think that way? At 13? With no other sexual interaction whatsoever? That’s where it started. \n\nI would dress up every chance I got and then.. I just kinda stopped.. I saw some girls and I was like damn... They’re hot. I started dating girls and having a great time, completely disregarding what has been going on. \n\nI was having a great time and then there was a knock at the door. “Hey! You forget about me?” \n\nIt was around 20 when that happened. I would only let that side out every now and then. In secret. \n\nThe divide took place. I am now two people in one body. I am OP but there is also op. I am two separate identities in one. \n\nI don’t know if I’m gender fluid. I am not unhappy with my current body. I am not unhappy that I have a penis and enjoy fucking women but I do love the thought of being a woman and taking dick. \n\nI’m unsure.

I'm a biological girl (AFAB) but I've been questioning my gender a lot recently. For most of my life I was pretty certain that I was female, maybe because society just told me I was or something, but in the last few months I started to discover that there are more genders than just male/female and I started questioning whether I'm really cis or whether I might be genderqueer/non-binary.

Once I actually started thinking about it, I realised that I don't really have that many 'female' traits and that I do have quite a few 'male' traits. I often don't feel like I belong with other girls and prefer to be around guys/non-binary folk. But this fluctuates a lot - some days I'm more feminine and on other days I'm more of a guy. This led me to think that I might be genderfluid.

The main thing that throws me off though is that I don't really know what defines being male and what defines being female. I don't fit the stereotypes of a girl (I don't like make-up, shopping etc) but does that necessarily make me a not-girl? What if I'm just a girl with different interests and personnality traits? And the other thing is that most genderfluid people I've talked to on the internet say that they've felt that way since early childhood.

84,2019-06-11 03:24:39,bz7e7i,11,42,"I'm AFAB and in my late 20s. I had identified as a lesbian for almost 12 years until last year. Last fall, a ton of suppressed dysphoria came up. It was intense. I had to come out, but didn't know what label to apply. I said I was genderfluid at the time. This sub helped me out a lot.

I'd had a few times before in which I felt distinctly masculine, dressed masc, and questioned my gender starting in my teens after coming out as lesbian, but dressed femme most of the time. Even in my femme phases though, I'd often fantasize about having an AMAB body or dying and reincarnating as a cis guy. My dream deep down was to be a cis guy who could express both masculinity and femininity and was emotionally integrated and free of toxic mindsets. (I'd long been repulsed by macho male egos.)

Those fantasies were a personal secret of mine until about last year. In fact, as far back as childhood, I recall feeling like I had a big ugly man inside me. I was really ashamed of my masculine energy because I was raised to see it as unacceptable and be super girly and cute. One of my intense subconscious fears was of it bursting out to the horror of other people. 

For most of my adult years, I felt very tight and uncomfortable in my skin. This I chalked up to trauma and aftereffects of meditation experiences. (Those were there too.) I felt like I wanted my conditioned identity to die for years often daily, especially in recent years. A huge amount of that weight was lifted as the suppressed dysphoria came up. It was a shock.

My gender hasn't fluctuated in the past eight months and probably won't.

Even just calling myself nonbinary and just using they/them pronouns hasn't felt masculine enough.

I now call myself a guy and go by he/him or they/them. It feels really good!

I had identified as a lesbian for almost 12 years until last year. Last fall, a ton of suppressed dysphoria came up. It was intense. I had to come out, but didn't know what label to apply. I said I was genderfluid at the time. This sub helped me out a lot.\n\nI'd had a few times before in which I felt distinctly masculine, dressed masc, and questioned my gender starting in my teens after coming out as lesbian, but dressed femme most of the time. Even in my femme phases though, I'd often fantasize about having an AMAB body or dying and reincarnating as a cis guy. My dream deep down was to be a cis guy who could express both masculinity and femininity and was emotionally integrated and free of toxic mindsets. (I'd long been repulsed by macho male egos.)\n\nThose fantasies were a personal secret of mine until about last year. In fact, as far back as childhood, I recall feeling like I had a big ugly man inside me. I was really ashamed of my masculine energy because I was raised to see it as unacceptable and be super girly and cute. One of my intense subconscious fears was of it bursting out to the horror of other people. \n\nFor most of my adult years, I felt very tight and uncomfortable in my skin. This I chalked up to trauma and aftereffects of meditation experiences. (Those were there too.) I felt like I wanted my conditioned identity to die for years often daily, especially in recent years. A huge amount of that weight was lifted as the suppressed dysphoria came up. It was a shock.

I’m AFaB (Assigned female at birth) and on the days when I feel like a guy, I want to embrace it. I want to dress like one and pass as one. However, as I’ve stated before, I’m in the closet. I do have a few clothes a guy would wear and a few unisex shirts, as well as a bunch of hoodies. Most of the stuff in my closet is more girly, which can be a struggle for me when I try to find something a bit more masculine to wear. I do wear hoodies a lot anyway, so that would probably help.

Now I would bind, but to be fair, I kinda have a flat chest already. I do use the double sports bra method (wear one normally, wear another one backwards on top) to help a bit more.

I have a hair appointment coming up as well, and I typically get my hair cut to around the bottom of my chin. I want to try and get a shorter hairstyle, but I don’t wanna be suspicious to my mom. (Although I did bring up “I might try getting my hair cut shorter” at the doctor’s office, and she asked  “Like a pixie cut?” and I shrugged.) I think it’d help me with my internal conflict.

Anyone have any tips? All help is appreciated!

137,2019-06-17 00:21:53,c1gzhv,8,7,"Hi there! Sorry in advance for the incoming wall of text.

For a long while now I have been looking over matters of identity and such. Trying to determine who, and what I am. I'm not talking months, I'm talking on and off for years now. 

A long time ago, I thought I felt more like a girl, but had no real thought behind why, I even bought a few dresses and other feminine things that I loved (never wore dress out, but would paint my nails). Fast forward a few years and I met a person who later discovered she was trans. She encouraged me to explore who I was, and to try and figure some stuff out, at least more so then I was. ((She heavily was pushing the 'you are trans like me' narrative though, partly because I think she didn't want to go through all of that alone.)) 

And for a while I tried thinking of myself as a woman, internally using more feminine nouns and terms. Had a name picked out and was generally feeling good about myself over all, even if I still didn't want to fully call myself a woman or start any sort of transition since it was still all sort of murky for me.

Then, at some point during it all, the thought of the feminine nouns and terms I was internally using didn't feel right, it almost made me feel sick. I would look in the mirror and think ""Beautiful doesn't fit, I am a lot more handsome"". Which just lead to even more confusion over all then when I had, at that time, started my whole quest for internal acceptance and understanding. 

Eventually the whole back and forth between feeling Masculine and Feminine became too much of a headache, and I decided that I am just me. People can call me whatever they like, and I largely didn't care for a good long while.

Then I read a post online from someone asking about gender, differances between certain things, etc etc. With one of the answers being to try thinking of yourself and how you feel as the opposite gender, if you opened your dresser and found specific female clothes, people called you by she and her, etc etc. The commenter said that thinking of the opposite gender of what they are didn't feel right for them, which is how they could tell they were male. It caused me to break down crying and going on a several hours long thought about the whole thing again. 

And largely, I don't know where I belong, so I want to revisit this topic and put the matter to rest finally. Several people say that gender fluid fits me best since I keep switching between feeling more of 1 or the other based upon the day. With no real set pattern involved. 

And, I want to learn. Hear stories about people who are genderfluid, how their daily lives tend to be, etc etc. Get some understanding that ""this could be normal"" or whatever.

I'm afab, 23, living with my partner,  and in general I'm a bit confused with everything lol.

But also, I used to distinctly feel feme or masc on certain days but right now... I don't know what I want really. Like I don't want to be fem, but I also have a hard time being masc in public, especially since i don't have much dude clothes. I'm just really self conscious haha, and accidentally heighten my voice when talking to people as a guy, ruining the illusion. 

I just ordered a cheap temporary binder until I have more money, and I might get some clothes over the weekend :) . Although he is supportive,  I am having a hard time with my partner. He's okay with it and makes jokes to try and make me feel more comfortable talking about it. Me coming out to him went surprisingly well, from me previously coming out to my parents about being bi, which was a disaster.

I just don't know how to explain it. I've read up a lot but it's really difficult to articulate this.

But, on one hand, I love my face, my legs and my sex, but I just hate my breast and feel that they have nothing to do on my body, I would like to change that, I honestly don't bear them. 

Is it ""normal"" to only want to change one thing? did this happened to anyone else? or is it just some kind of 'crise' ?

But, on one hand, I love my face, my legs and my sex, but I just hate my breast and feel that they have nothing to do on my body, I would like to change that, I honestly don\'t bear them. \n\nIs it ""normal"" to only want to change one thing? did this happened to anyone else? or is it just some kind of \'crise\' ? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hope I don\'t bother you, thank you all for the answers and have a nice evening :)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEmma', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Feeling kind of lost', 'created': 1560988736.0}"

So I'm genderfluid afab, and im just having a hard time even as a girl, dealing with my chest.

I do get top dysphoria like crazy when I'm identifying as male, but not really when I'm female... but I still don't really feel happy about my chest.

I think it's partially because when ever I've read something with genderfluid people/characters they have had top surgery or have a flat chest or talk about being female but not feeling the need/want for a chest.

All of which are valid opinions to have!

It just makes me feel like... maybe I shouldn't or can't be be genderfluid since i have a chest...

I have a binder, but top surgery is out of the question for me since I apparently have some uh strong negative reactions to the thought of surgery and it isn't healthy for me to even think about, but anyone I see who's genderfluid is either amab or afab with top surgery.

It just makes me feel like I'm not doing enough or I'm not good enough or I don't belong. I've been feeling that people would prefer with with surgery, that people would prefer me as a trans-male

I just,,, dont feel like I'm fully accepted within the LGBT community maybe...

idk i just want to like my chest, at least when im female

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what I'm hoping for by posting here. I suppose reassurance? Also if any of you know of any media/stories of any kind who are genderfluid and afab maybe that would be good for me too see? I don't know, I may just delete this post after a while.

My dysphoric or feminine-feeling periods tend to come in waves of a few months at a time. I'll feel very strongly feminine and freak out about transitioning for a few months, but the feelings eventually fade, and I'll spend a few months feeling more comfortable presenting as a guy, and then maybe the cycle repeats itself. 

I will say, I don't exactly feel non-binary. I've never really identified with the more... ambiguous(?) modes of presentation. Is a strictly binary gender fluidity a thing?

I am physically male and predominantly identify as male gendered. However I do sometimes slip into what feels like a female gender at times, more often when I'm at home alone with my girlfriend and am feeling a bit sassy or sweet or playful.

Lately I've felt a need to express this female side more. My gf bought me a silk robe, which totally helps, and sometimes she puts a headband on me. But I started thinking about making some kind of avatar of my female self.

So here's my queation: are there any good apps out there that anyone uses to create representations of yourselves in different genders? I'd love to have something on my phone I can look at and say ""this is me right now.""

I enjoy being male, for the most part, but something also makes me feel like I want to be female. I want to be able to dress more feminine, and a lot of it comes from my newly discovered pansexuality. After coming out to myself, it’s heightened my feelings of wanting to be another gender.

TL.DR: Finally came out to my soon-wife (and for myself) as genderfluid, bisexual and she accepted me.

After more than twelve year self-delusion I finally came out a few weeks ago to my fiancée after in eight years together. But first, I have had to come out to myself.

I assigned as male, but before my tenth birthday, there were many sings I am not as like as the others. To keep it short, I find interest in girly clothes and sometimes I found it please when someone misspelled my name into a female name. In my country, we don't have gender-specific verbs and pronouns, and sadly, there are zero unisex given names (by the law, every given name must be used on only one gender). So, sometimes I found myself happy, when someone unintentionally changes just one letter, and formed my name into a female one.

I have to add, I had a lovely mom&amp;dad, but with strict gender stereotypes. They fulfilled the concept of man and female. Dad worked hard for the living, and in his free time,  he goes crafting something in the garage or go for fishing or working out, while mom stayed at home, and only do the house chores and take care of me. Anyway, before I could name my self what I am, I already filled with gender expectations. I didn't dare to show off my femme side, and somewhere, I felt abnormal.  To add up, they were a bit homophobic, but really far not drastic. They just said ""*They are different.""*  but don't put any effort to explain it to my younger-self, probably because of fear.

&amp;#x200B;

At my 13 years-old age, I did something bad.  I lost all of my friends from a mistake I made. This was a terrible and bad mistake, and I lost all my social connection and every day, I thought everyone laugh on me. I was humiliated, but this is not because of gender, I just did something really inappropriate.

I slowly fall into a deep depression for three years, without anyone who knows how many things hurts me. I really looked for love, any kind of love. I don't want to be dramatic, but I wrote my final later with my wills and I was ready to jump and sliced up by a train. I hated everyone who had fun on me, and I wanted to show them, what they did with me.

Within the depression, I found out, I need love. I know, I can't survive this on any other way. And soon again, I had to accept, I am so deep, I didn't even mind it's boy or girl (I hade narrowed minded with only two genders).

&amp;#x200B;

This was much harder and longer, but after an eternity, I found a girl who helped me, and does so today.  But my identity next to my girlfriend is just... I'm not the *man* she looked for. When she was away I lurked after her clothes, imagining myself as a girl. Sometimes I looked her do her makeup and when I saw she is happy as she is, I know something is not good with me, because I wanted to be in her place. Sometimes  I didn't want to be the Nordic Viking kind man she wants. But sometimes I tried hard, try to work out hard, but it wasn't me.  Now I know, most of the time I wanted to look, androgynes, but without proper information, I don't even know this is a thing. I wanted to look like both ways, and be anything/anyone who is I.

Before I met my soon-wife there was some special events where costumes and cross-dressing was accepted and hell... I really liked that. I felt my self first time full, but you already know, how much I fear from humiliation. So despite my feelings, I dropped the skirts and the makeups and be what I not really is.

My soon-wife in past eight years sometimes asked me serious questions, but without any bad intent. She wanted for me the best, and sometimes, she knew I hiding something. Maybe she feared that I don't love her. Most of the times, I handled this easily but once I decided, it's enough, and I need to know what is that I feel.

I had a hard two weeks of thinking. I had no fear. I know my soon-wife loves *me*, and the worst I can do is lie to both of us. From her perspective... previously she said, she loves me, but if I am into guys, it's not wrong, just tell it, because she does not want to live decades together if it isn't the best for both of us.

&amp;#x200B;

So there comes you, dear r/ genderfluid reditors. In the two weeks, I found out I was genderfluid all the time. I'm most of the times happy with how I'm, but on other days it's felt like stuck in a wrong body.  To state, I don't want to transition. When my femme side is up, the best I wish for a walk in public as female without others know this is not my assigned.  I wish the word accept me as a female in those days.

I want to live my femme side, but... simply I can't.

It was far in the past, but I still have fear from peoples. I look way to masculine. I'm 184cm hight (approx 6 feet), wide in shoulders and have some muscles, and I have a far deep voice.

I had to accept, I can't live as femme at public.

Finally, I wrote a novel about myself, about everything that led me here. The whole story was more than 40 full A4 pages, so I wrote out everything, each and last secrets and unspoken things. And I put my fate into my soon-wifes hand.

40 page is a lot, but finally, I was able to introduce my true self and tell the whole story, how I found out I'm bisexual and genderfluid. She knew many things before, but now, every last piece placed to the correct place.

She loves me, but I little hurt her with my secrets. We are really close to each other, and after 8 years this was a bit too many secrets. I spotted for her, these things not secrets before her, these were secrets before myself. She loves my manly side, and I can't blame her for being androsexual (as we know, she is cis-straight with some bi-curious intent, but she is in love with Viking types utterly). I told her, I know who I'm and I don't plan to do anything about it. I told her, I accepted myself, and least finally, I know what I feel. And I told her, maybe I change one or two little things, but my body type and social fears won't let me live my both side.

A weak ago, while we shopping in a mall, she just walked to a watch shop. We can't afford a nice watch right now, but she told me, I can have one at my irl cake-day. And the best thing is, she told that *we'll find something nice black or white, maybe rose-gold like... something which always fit for you.*

It hit me in the heart. I felt accepted and I know it's not much just a unisex watch, but this will my best birthdays gift ever.

&amp;#x200B;

My dreams always were vivid about my identity, but for sure, yet, I borrowed them. After I came out, my nighttime dreams just lost control. Almost every dream have some reference for me as femme. But most of the time, I fight against my fears. I fight against the world, which will never accept me as femme, and dream about hiding myself from my mom&amp;dad, whos probably will never know who I am really is.

After I spoked my dreams out to my love she casually offered me, if I wish, we can go and buy some clothes for me.

I know this is as hard for her as for me... She is more than kind.

To end my story, I refused her offer, because honestly, I'm not ready for this.

I like your stories, and it gave me strength... so I hope, I can do the same for someone.

I hope one day I can represent myself with pictures, but yet, this is my first big step.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you all!

But first, I have had to come out to myself.\n\nI assigned as male, but before my tenth birthday, there were many sings I am not as like as the others. To keep it short, I find interest in girly clothes and sometimes I found it please when someone misspelled my name into a female name. In my country, we don\'t have gender-specific verbs and pronouns, and sadly, there are zero unisex given names (by the law, every given name must be used on only one gender). So, sometimes I found myself happy, when someone unintentionally changes just one letter, and formed my name into a female one.\n\nI have to add, I had a lovely mom&amp;dad, but with strict gender stereotypes. They fulfilled the concept of man and female. Dad worked hard for the living, and in his free time,  he goes crafting something in the garage or go for fishing or working out, while mom stayed at home, and only do the house chores and take care of me. Anyway, before I could name my self what I am, I already filled with gender expectations. I didn\'t dare to show off my femme side, and somewhere, I felt abnormal.  To add up, they were a bit homophobic, but really far not drastic. They just said ""*They are different.""*  but don\'t put any effort to explain it to my younger-self, probably because of fear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt my 13 years-old age, I did something bad.  I lost all of my friends from a mistake I made. This was a terrible and bad mistake, and I lost all my social connection and every day, I thought everyone laugh on me. I was humiliated, but this is not because of gender, I just did something really inappropriate.\n\nI slowly fall into a deep depression for three years, without anyone who knows how many things hurts me. I really looked for love, any kind of love. I don\'t want to be dramatic, but I wrote my final later with my wills and I was ready to jump and sliced up by a train. I hated everyone who had fun on me, and I wanted to show them, what they did with me.\n\nWithin the depression, I found out, I need love. I know, I can\'t survive this on any other way. And soon again, I had to accept, I am so deep, I didn\'t even mind it\'s boy or girl (I hade narrowed minded with only two genders).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis was much harder and longer, but after an eternity, I found a girl who helped me, and does so today.  But my identity next to my girlfriend is just... I\'m not the *man* she looked for. When she was away I lurked after her clothes, imagining myself as a girl. Sometimes I looked her do her makeup and when I saw she is happy as she is, I know something is not good with me, because I wanted to be in her place. Sometimes  I didn\'t want to be the Nordic Viking kind man she wants. But sometimes I tried hard, try to work out hard, but it wasn\'t me.  Now I know, most of the time I wanted to look, androgynes, but without proper information, I don\'t even know this is a thing. I wanted to look like both ways, and be anything/anyone who is I.\n\nBefore I met my soon-wife there was some special events where costumes and cross-dressing was accepted and hell... I really liked that. I felt my self first time full, but you already know, how much I fear from humiliation. So despite my feelings, I dropped the skirts and the makeups and be what I not really is.\n\nMy soon-wife in past eight years sometimes asked me serious questions, but without any bad intent. She wanted for me the best, and sometimes, she knew I hiding something. Maybe she feared that I don\'t love her. Most of the times, I handled this easily but once I decided, it\'s enough, and I need to know what is that I feel.\n\nI had a hard two weeks of thinking. I had no fear. I know my soon-wife loves *me*, and the worst I can do is lie to both of us. From her perspective... previously she said, she loves me, but if I am into guys, it\'s not wrong, just tell it, because she does not want to live decades together if it isn\'t the best for both of us.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo there comes you, dear r/ genderfluid reditors. In the two weeks, I found out I was genderfluid all the time. I\'m most of the times happy with how I\'m, but on other days it\'s felt like stuck in a wrong body.  To state, I don\'t want to transition. When my femme side is up, the best I wish for a walk in public as female without others know this is not my assigned.  I wish the word accept me as a female in those days.\n\nI want to live my femme side, but... simply I can\'t.\n\nIt was far in the past, but I still have fear from peoples. I look way to masculine. I\'m 184cm hight (approx 6 feet), wide in shoulders and have some muscles, and I have a far deep voice.\n\nI had to accept, I can\'t live as femme at public.\n\nFinally, I wrote a novel about myself, about everything that led me here. The whole story was more than 40 full A4 pages, so I wrote out everything, each and last secrets and unspoken things. And I put my fate into my soon-wifes hand.\n\n40 page is a lot, but finally, I was able to introduce my true self and tell the whole story, how I found out I\'m bisexual and genderfluid. She knew many things before, but now, every last piece placed to the correct place.\n\nShe loves me, but I little hurt her with my secrets. We are really close to each other, and after 8 years this was a bit too many secrets. I spotted for her, these things not secrets before her, these were secrets before myself. She loves my manly side, and I can\'t blame her for being androsexual (as we know, she is cis-straight with some bi-curious intent, but she is in love with Viking types utterly). I told her, I know who I\'m and I don\'t plan to do anything about it. I told her, I accepted myself, and least finally, I know what I feel. And I told her, maybe I change one or two little things, but my body type and social fears won\'t let me live my both side.\n\nA weak ago, while we shopping in a mall, she just walked to a watch shop.

I always called myself a tomboy, but that changed since the dysphoria started, I hate my body for real, but I'm almost sure I'm not trans (like 100% want to be a dude), because sometimes I feel okay being a girl, I feel more feminine from time to time but that's a bit rare in comparison to the times I feel masculine.  


The major problem I've been having apart from the dysphoria is the relationship with my boyfriend, we've been together for a long ass time and I love him a lot, but he's obviously straight and this doesn't really help me with my dysphoria cause whenever we get intimate it just makes me more aware of my body, he knows I see myself as genderfluid, and he's aware of my problems, I also suffer from depression and anxiety, and he's always been there for me and never once pressured me regarding sex, which we rarely have because of my dysphoria, the only times we have anything is when I'm feeling feminine, which again, is rare.  


I can't break up with him, we've been together for almost a decade and I love him too much.
