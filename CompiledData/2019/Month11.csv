killing time for a while, i pulled out my phone outside some random Dunkin donuts to figure out how far I was from the theater. my guard was down. first mistake. out of nowhere, some random guy on the street starts trying to talk at me. Not to me, at me. again. ive learned from all the other times that i should just ignore it, but it still startled me. 

without thinking, i took off my headphones (which I wear for exactly this reason, but apparently he didn't take the hint) and asked him what he wanted. second mistake. he yelled, ""YOU'RE A GIRL, RIGHT?"" i was only 2 feet away, but he yelled as if I was across the street. naturally, i froze. this shouldn't be complicated. but suddenly years of stress and confusion started bubbling up and i honestly didn't know how to respond.

stunned, i croaked, ""I don't know."" third mistake. actually, i do know. i know better than anyone. but in that moment, i wasn't answering his question. i was answering a more pressing question in my head, ""how do you explain being non-binary to a stranger?"". i really don't know. 

he paused, confused by my answer.

I've known I was non-binary my whole life, and after holding it in for 33 years I just couldn't take it anymore and came out to my wife.  We have 3 kids and I have a crazy career.  Her stance is that my ""queerness"" has no place in our family life and none of our friends or family can know. Furthermore,  she has been very clear that if anyone finds out she will immediately file for divorce. 


This leaves me in an impossible situation.  I'm relegated to taking overnight trips here and there and occasionally heading into the city for an evening so that I can have a little time to be out as my true self- but I feel so isolated when I do this. Not only am I away from everyone I love when I'm out, but I feel like I can't make any friends or build relationships because I'm living a double life and I'd just come across as a phony. 


I wish so much I could be my true self in my family,  social, and work life but I just can't. And I can't bear the idea of losing my family.  So what the hell do i do? Should i just accept that being able to be my true self is just not in the cards for me? And just suffer through the rest of my life?  


I really need some guidance,  has anyone been in a situation? I've been an emotional wreck over this since coming out 9 months ago- battling depression, anxiety,  and panic attacks.  I want so badly to be my true self,  and I want so badly to hold onto my family and friends.  What do I do? Where do i turn?

64,2019-11-01 17:53:02,dq7ra7,8,3,"The Labor of Being Transgender is a t4t art project and pseudo letter writing campaign featuring letters written by transgender people about the difficulties we experience on a daily basis due to our gender identity. They exist in the form of a stereotypical greeting card and are paired with decorative, delicate, yet powerful imagery. These are our letters to people that participate in this unwelcoming society, in microagressions, and in violence towards the trans community. This body of work is healing for us as a community, and it exists primarily for us. We are putting these experiences in writing for ourselves so that we can in common conversation acknowledge the daily labors we perform, and process the daily violence of our lives as a community.

https://forms.gle/e2YxFvmD8c3Kc2nt7

That is a link to the Google form to submit letters through. I am looking to have as many participants as I can for this project and this is my last ditch effort to get some more responses before I have to install my exhibition on the 15th of November. If you have any questions about the project feel free to ask them here or to DM me. I just really want to spread the word about this in these last few weeks.

My name is Jessica Taylor and I am currently reading for my doctorate in counselling psychology with the University of West England. My email address is [Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk](mailto:Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk) (for verification). I'm a (binary) transwoman and am looking to explore non-binary individuals experiences of their bodies. To this end I have obtained permission from the mods to post my survey [here](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Tgy71QzzRx6eW1?fbclid=IwAR03ttpvsz_oygS0MC6SZNG24SDkm9ZdRuwjoQIJUwVBEp3z_y4YWj8cosU).

I have previously worked with the non-binary community to explore their experience of being non-binary (without the focus on their bodies), with this work being published in the *International Journal of Transgenderism* (a copy of which is available, upon request, to anyone over at my [researchgate page](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jessica_Taylor73)). This current research is aimed at getting more of a non-binary voice into the research on non-binary identity, so any interest would be welcome.

The survey itself is qualitative in nature - so it's all about the collection of rich descriptions (in other words, if you choose to complete it, write as much as you can muster!) and you don't have to complete it all in one sitting - you can come back to it anytime within a two week period. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have, or to make any further amendments here if the mods feel them necessary.

117,2019-11-02 17:16:03,dqn6rw,5,18,"So I realized I was gender nonconforming/genderqueer/nonbinary about four years ago. I always knew I wasn't trans, but I've never felt ""female"", more just nothing. I have the words now to explain how I've always felt.

This realization happened in the course of a fight with my spouse. A child at a school I worked at was outed by a volunteer parent made employee mid year and she sent a staff wide email saying that because of a trans gender 7 year old going to our school all of the girls were at risk of rape in the bathrooms. Never mind that the kid was using the single stall bathroom in the nurse's office to make herself more comfortable.

I was livid. My husband asked what was wrong. I explained and he got mad at me. ""I agree with the coworker. That family is abusing their kid and they are going to grow up messed up.""

I got even more angry, said I felt like that as a kid, and I feel like I grew up messed up. Apparently this threatened his fragile masculinity and he screamed at me. We had never fought like that and haven't since. I've definitely wanted to leave since then, but can't yet.

So that was a long introduction. I've been working at a different school for the past two years with two great guys. It's very small. My older coworker explained he doesn't care for the transgender stuff because he doesn't believe in gender norms anyhow. He feels masculine, but has performed ballet, and humans are kind of dumb for ascribing gender roles to the things we do anyhow. I can respect that because I feel much the same way. We talked after I came out to him.

My younger coworker was more sheltered and was talking about arguing in a college class that gender is set by chromosomes and there is a binary. I discussed and shared a lot of resources with him, but he got uncomfortable and shut down. He didn't bring it up for a while. Then he was helping me set up my classroom this summer and mentioned his fiancee's sister was going into 9th grade. She was coming out as nonbinary and he and his fiancee were struggling at being supportive. I told him I was nonbinary and we just talked a little bit, but it made me feel so happy!

I spent a weekend with them at a MagicFest event. I noticed one of the organizers had their pronouns under their name tag. However they physically presented as male and had a feminine name and she/her pronouns. Apparently the Magic the Gathering community and Wizards of the Coast has a lot of trans and nonbinary people and my older coworker mentioned this later. We started talking about the organizer and I said it made me happy to see them use their desired name and pronouns.

My coworkers were like, ""Yeah, that's fine, but why? Why go to the trouble if you aren't going to try and look the way you say you feel on the inside? It's weird.""

That was several weeks ago, and at the time we were walking and I am slow and can't articulate my thoughts well while moving. Nobody owes them ""passing"" and that's what they were alluding to. I present female because my stupid body would be hella uncomfortable to really try to ""pass"" as male. I'm not male. I'm not female. I'm just me and I wear what feels and looks nice. Plus, a dress is one less piece of clothing to not get dirty.

I don't know if I should or how to bring this back up, but it's been in the back of my mind. I love and trust my coworkers and think they will understand and be supportive over time. I told my husband I've felt like separating since our fight and he said he doesn't understand why I don't feel female, but he loves me, and is sorry he screamed at me. He doesn't get it, but if calling myself nonbinary makes me happy he just will ignore it.",NonBinary,Should I bother to try and bring it up?,1572740163.0,"{'created_utc': 1572714963, 'id': 'dqn6rw', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 18, 'selftext': 'So I realized I was gender nonconforming/genderqueer/nonbinary about four years ago.

I\'ve definitely wanted to leave since then, but can\'t yet.\n\nSo that was a long introduction. I\'ve been working at a different school for the past two years with two great guys. It\'s very small. My older coworker explained he doesn\'t care for the transgender stuff because he doesn\'t believe in gender norms anyhow. He feels masculine, but has performed ballet, and humans are kind of dumb for ascribing gender roles to the things we do anyhow. I can respect that because I feel much the same way. We talked after I came out to him.\n\nMy younger coworker was more sheltered and was talking about arguing in a college class that gender is set by chromosomes and there is a binary. I discussed and shared a lot of resources with him, but he got uncomfortable and shut down. He didn\'t bring it up for a while. Then he was helping me set up my classroom this summer and mentioned his fiancee\'s sister was going into 9th grade. She was coming out as nonbinary and he and his fiancee were struggling at being supportive. I told him I was nonbinary and we just talked a little bit, but it made me feel so happy!\n\nI spent a weekend with them at a MagicFest event. I noticed one of the organizers had their pronouns under their name tag. However they physically presented as male and had a feminine name and she/her pronouns. Apparently the Magic the Gathering community and Wizards of the Coast has a lot of trans and nonbinary people and my older coworker mentioned this later. We started talking about the organizer and I said it made me happy to see them use their desired name and pronouns.\n\nMy coworkers were like, ""Yeah, that\'s fine, but why? Why go to the trouble if you aren\'t going to try and look the way you say you feel on the inside? It\'s weird.""\n\nThat was several weeks ago, and at the time we were walking and I am slow and can\'t articulate my thoughts well while moving. Nobody owes them ""passing"" and that\'s what they were alluding to. I present female because my stupid body would be hella uncomfortable to really try to ""pass"" as male. I\'m not male. I\'m not female. I\'m just me and I wear what feels and looks nice. Plus, a dress is one less piece of clothing to not get dirty.\n\nI don\'t know if I should or how to bring this back up, but it\'s been in the back of my mind. I love and trust my coworkers and think they will understand and be supportive over time. I told my husband I\'ve felt like separating since our fight and he said he doesn\'t understand why I don\'t feel female, but he loves me, and is sorry he screamed at me. He doesn\'t get it, but if calling myself nonbinary makes me happy he just will ignore it.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Should I bother to try and bring it up?', 'created': 1572740163.0}"

I'm in my late 20s and AFAB. I'm positive that I'm not a trans man. I think I may be non-binary but I'm not sure. I grew up as a  ""tomboy"" And have always been interested in more ""masculine"" hobbies. But I also love makeup. I have days where I want to dress more masculine and days where I want to curl my hair and wear floral dresses. My very curvy body prevents me (in my own mind) from ever presenting more masculine, but I often think  if I were thinner or had a less curvy body, that I would love to present more masculine on occasion. I naturally have a deeper voice and more than average body hair.

At least since I was in middle school I've day dreamed about having a penis but never wanting it to replace my vulva/vagina. I either think of having both or wishing so badly that it was possible to take a pill to change my body at will. Sometimes with the thought of changing my genitals and sometimes with having a complete male body for a day. I've always had high libido so I've always chocked this feeling up to being nothing more than a sexual fantasy.

I've read about how some non-binary individuals have body dismorphia or get very bothered if someone misgenders them. For me, I don't feel that I completely hate a part of my body - I just wish I could add to it or change it at will. And as far as gender goes.. ""I don't really care"" is the best way I can describe it. As stated before, I don't feel like I could (currently) successfully represent as masculine, but if I were to and someone called me ""he"" it might make me a little giddy? But I have no real issue with Being called ""she"".  When I hear someone call me ""she/her"" I do have this small moment in my mind that is hard to explain. It's almost like it takes me a second to realize it's me that they're talking about. My brain - ""She who?.. Oh! Me. Right."" But it doesn't irk me or upset me. And I'm completely fine with ""they"".

I imagine that I would be cool, in general, with she/they pronouns. And I wouldn't be bothered by ""he"" if I ever felt like I could present myself that way. But there's a part of me that feels like a ""fake"" because I'm AFAB, and in a long term relationship with a cis man. I already struggle with feeling valid because I'm pansexual but am ""straight presenting"" as far as my relationship goes. And I for sure look female.

I guess I'm just wanting some sort of insight? Validation? Seeing if there are others that feel the same as me?

141,2019-11-03 00:31:51,dqt4w7,2,16,"I recently watched The Good Place 4.4 (Tinker Tailor Demon Spy). 

Janet has long been one of my favorite characters with how she’s apparently some form of nonbinary / doesn’t experience gender the same way (most) humans do, and how she corrects Jason and others when they call her a girl, always replying with “not a girl.” 

~~When she failed to do that in this episode, I said it when I expected her to say it, then shrieked and hit my partner, sitting next to me on the couch. Then Jason revealed that she wasn’t actually *our* Janet but a Bad Janet, and I just went “see see i knew something was wrong! She didn’t say ‘not a girl’!” I feel so vindicated!~~

I’ve been starting to identify with Janet a bunch bc I’m AFAB and my gender presentation is usually on the femme side (though sometimes androgynous). So I’ve also been feeling a bit resentful about how Jason continually misgenders her and calls her a girl. But now I’m starting to think it might be more of a running gag between them, because ~~this episode showed that Jason clearly knows and acknowledges that she’s not a girl, so maybe with them it’s evolved into more of a continual joke, or like a “call and answer” style catchphrase, rather than a misgendering that’s either intentional or accidental and her correcting him.

For context, my upbringing is such a common ""Trans"" experience. I had a gender neutral name and I loved it for that. My favorite color was green because it was for both ""girls and boys"". I had a really stereotypically gender-neutral taste in hobbies+interests (dogs, drawing, video games). I used to always wonder why I was put into female situations all the time, but never questioned it hard because ""I'm not a dude, right?"" and had to be taught I was a girl and wondered where the ""third option"" was for bathrooms as a five year old. 

I got really uncomfortable with my chest and I didn't like the fact I wasn't allowed to cut my hair as a kid. I started loose binding when I was 13 with layers and sports bras. I even thought I was a trans guy at one point because the idea of me being a girl for the rest of my life felt uncomfortable, only to further realize that being treated as a dude didn't feel like me either. 

Even though I didn't have the ""I wanna be a boy"" or ""what if I'm a boy"" thoughts, I did have basically a trans-nonbinary childhood. I just never saw myself as a boy or a girl. I felt null and unaligned from the idea of gender, but I knew for other people gender was important to them (and it is for me too, even with my inability to relate to binary genders). 

This was confusing and I got into trans youtubers. I found a couple trans-medicalist youtubers and have been following them for a while. They kept iterating how you need dysphoria to be trans while also mocking nonbinary people. I felt conflicted but continued watching because well... many nonbinary people express their gender so differently to how I do and sometimes what other nonbinary people do would make me feel dysphoric. I unfortunately adopted this mindset that too many people appropriate the nonbinary label just because they're GNC and that you need dysphoria to be trans. 

But today I watched this video where there was a trans woman that had transitioned over ten years ago and she had to go through a lot to get to the point where she is now. She explained how much easier it is for trans people to access resources now than it was for her, and how truscum tend to promote this definist fallacy that cis people will accept them just because they are able to explain their identity in a way that might make sense to a cis person. After I finally got that explanation instead of just hearing the common ""truscum are awful uwu""  or ""you don't need dysphoria to be trans."" It finally got explained to me in a way that makes sense. 

I see it a lot like how you don't need Major Depressive Disorder to have Depression. People with depression as just as valid to seek therapy or other resources to alleviate their mental illness. If you don't have what qualifies in the medical field as gender dysphoria, but transitioning will ultimately better your life and/or you feel more comfortable just knowing there's a word that describes your experience with gender, you're nonbinary enough.

Are you a parent or prospective parent? Do you identify as non-binary, gender-nonconforming, genderqueer, and/or gender fluid? If so, you might be able to participate in a paid Harvard study examining the experiences of GNC parents. **Confidentiality is guaranteed, and $20/hr compensation is provided for a casual interview.**

This is a qualitative study that will examine the attitudes and experiences of non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer parents. The research will answer the question: how do GNC individuals navigate their parent identity, and how to they share the roles and responsibilities of parenting?

Sociologists have extensively studied parenting and gender inequality in home. Moreover, literature has positioned the differentiation of motherhood and fatherhood as a driver of the gender binary. However, this research has focused primarily on cisgender and heterosexual parents or cis gay/lesbian parents. Non-binary, gender nonconforming, and genderqueer individuals remain a population of parents that social science research has ignored. This work will fill this gap. By studying the attitudes and experiences of individuals who do not identify as strictly male or female, this work will contribute to a greater sociological understanding of gender, parenting, and the binary.

i’m stuck on how to come out as i know flat out telling her i’m non binary will probably lead to some confusion on her half, however its the most direct route. on the other hand, i could tell her i’m trans, which is not 100% accurate but it’s something she’ll understand easier as she’s much more familiar with the language.

i guess my point is i’m at a loss at what to tell her. i should also mention that she is not the brightest person i know, and anything too difficult may confuse her.

thing is, i know very little about the whole subject, and im kind of a bit paranoid of googling all this stuff, i would love to know more from other nonbinary folk - how does 'low' or 'temporary' doses of HRT work? i'm not quite sure i understand, but it sounds like it might be ideal for me, to have low-dose T (or however it's referred to)? what happens when you stop? etc.

i want my voice to change, i want facial hair, i want my body in general to be more androgynous. while im fine with my boobs, i did use to bind them, so having less of them really isn't a concern to me. i don't fully understand bottom changes either but i don't think i'm terribly bothered by them. all i know is i really don't want to go FULL T, i want to be androgynous, not necessarily masc-passing, you know? but especially as of the last 6 months this urge to go on HRT has been getting to me, even triggering dysphoria i was previously fine with, so i wanted to come and ask on this reddit?

additionally, has anyone had experience with HRT within the UK? i am part of a LGBTQ+ group in my city, but i haven't had the courage to talk to a counsellor about it just yet, as i don't know exactly what it is i'm looking for. any advice at all would be really helpful, any anecdotes or even just explaining HRT to me like i'm 5 (jk.... or am i?)

for more context i am 20, turning 21 in april. while in the UK, our public healthcare is a bit of a mess right now, i am eligible for free prescriptions (under a HC2, a form of benefits), i'm not sure whether that would apply to HRT but i'm throwing it out there just incase. thank you for any responses, in advance!!",NonBinary,AFAB NB - Seriously considering HRT?,1572950463.0,"{'created_utc': 1572925263, 'id': 'drtm2j', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""hi there! my name's V, i've identified as nonbinary for about 8 years now and my presentation has really gone all over the place, but something thats always been a bit of a constant is i feel i want some kind of HRT. \n\nthing is, i know very little about the whole subject, and im kind of a bit paranoid of googling all this stuff, i would love to know more from other nonbinary folk - how does 'low' or 'temporary' doses of HRT work? i'm not quite sure i understand, but it sounds like it might be ideal for me, to have low-dose T (or however it's referred to)? what happens when you stop? etc.\n\ni want my voice to change, i want facial hair, i want my body in general to be more androgynous. while im fine with my boobs, i did use to bind them, so having less of them really isn't a concern to me. i don't fully understand bottom changes either but i don't think i'm terribly bothered by them. all i know is i really don't want to go FULL T, i want to be androgynous, not necessarily masc-passing, you know? but especially as of the last 6 months this urge to go on HRT has been getting to me, even triggering dysphoria i was previously fine with, so i wanted to come and ask on this reddit?\n\nadditionally, has anyone had experience with HRT within the UK? i am part of a LGBTQ+ group in my city, but i haven't had the courage to talk to a counsellor about it just yet, as i don't know exactly what it is i'm looking for. any advice at all would be really helpful, any anecdotes or even just explaining HRT to me like i'm 5 (jk.... or am i?)\n\nfor more context i am 20, turning 21 in april. while in the UK, our public healthcare is a bit of a mess right now, i am eligible for free prescriptions (under a HC2, a form of benefits), i'm not sure whether that would apply to HRT but i'm throwing it out there just incase. thank you for any responses, in advance!!"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'AFAB NB - Seriously considering HRT?', 'created': 1572950463.0}"

I feel a bit defeated and kind of understand why no one made the effort to introduce actual gender neutral pronouns into our language. That shit is way harder than it should be.

309,2019-11-06 03:38:21,dsam8x,6,8,"Hi, this is my first reddit post so bare with me please. Later on in this post I am going to be talking about a bad experience I had in response to coming out as a nonbinary lesbian, which may be distressing.

I’ve identified as a cisgender lesbian for the past few years. I’ve always felt very solid in being a lesbian, but this past year I’ve had some realizations about my gender identity. While I’m still figuring a lot out, I came to the conclusion that I identify as a nonbinary lesbian. I do still feel aligned with womanhood to a certain extent, and while I questioned this for a long time, doing some reading about women-aligned nonbinary folks gave me a lot of clarity. I was happy to find a label that I felt described me well. I told a few trans friends of mine who live in different cities and they also provided me with a lot of guidance in figuring things out. 

From there I thought the next step would be to tell my girlfriend. We’ve been dating for a little under a year and she means the world to me. I’ve always been careful in assessing the quality of our relationship and it has always felt very healthy. She is cisgender and generally describes herself as either bisexual or queer, though she identified as a lesbian for a long time. She is generally very aware about social issues so I did not think coming out to her would be a problem. Today I told her that I think I’m nonbinary. I think she was surprised at first, but she said okay and told me that she supports me. I then told her that I’m still figuring everything out and that I still feel like a lesbian. At this point she had some reservations. 

She is of the mindset that you can either be nonbinary or a woman and that there is no overlap between them, so it doesn’t make sense to claim to be a nonbinary lesbian. She was “irked” (her word) at the idea of nonbinary people “appropriating” (also her word) lesbianism because to her, it’s something inherently tied to binary womanhood. She said that she felt like claiming to be a nonbinary lesbian was like getting something that was a benefit of womanhood (ie the joys of being a wlw) without having the responsibility of womanhood (ie protecting other women). I tried explaining a lot of different things, including that  I would never stop protecting women, that nonbinary isn’t just a third gender, and that I still experience oppression under misogyny. Her response to the last one was that because I’m nonbinary, it’s oppression in a different way, and thus doesn’t mean that I should be able to claim womanhood if I don’t fully align with it. I think it’s important to note that she could not provide a clear definition of womanhood. She said the whole thing was a matter of community. She was respectful and never blatantly demeaning, but the whole thing was very distressing to say the least. I’m not out to anyone else in my town, so I’m kind of desperate for support here.

Later on in this post I am going to be talking about a bad experience I had in response to coming out as a nonbinary lesbian, which may be distressing.\n\nI’ve identified as a cisgender lesbian for the past few years. I’ve always felt very solid in being a lesbian, but this past year I’ve had some realizations about my gender identity. While I’m still figuring a lot out, I came to the conclusion that I identify as a nonbinary lesbian. I do still feel aligned with womanhood to a certain extent, and while I questioned this for a long time, doing some reading about women-aligned nonbinary folks gave me a lot of clarity. I was happy to find a label that I felt described me well. I told a few trans friends of mine who live in different cities and they also provided me with a lot of guidance in figuring things out. \n\nFrom there I thought the next step would be to tell my girlfriend. We’ve been dating for a little under a year and she means the world to me. I’ve always been careful in assessing the quality of our relationship and it has always felt very healthy. She is cisgender and generally describes herself as either bisexual or queer, though she identified as a lesbian for a long time. She is generally very aware about social issues so I did not think coming out to her would be a problem. Today I told her that I think I’m nonbinary. I think she was surprised at first, but she said okay and told me that she supports me. I then told her that I’m still figuring everything out and that I still feel like a lesbian. At this point she had some reservations. \n\nShe is of the mindset that you can either be nonbinary or a woman and that there is no overlap between them, so it doesn’t make sense to claim to be a nonbinary lesbian. She was “irked” (her word) at the idea of nonbinary people “appropriating” (also her word) lesbianism because to her, it’s something inherently tied to binary womanhood. She said that she felt like claiming to be a nonbinary lesbian was like getting something that was a benefit of womanhood (ie the joys of being a wlw) without having the responsibility of womanhood (ie protecting other women). I tried explaining a lot of different things, including that  I would never stop protecting women, that nonbinary isn’t just a third gender, and that I still experience oppression under misogyny. Her response to the last one was that because I’m nonbinary, it’s oppression in a different way, and thus doesn’t mean that I should be able to claim womanhood if I don’t fully align with it. I think it’s important to note that she could not provide a clear definition of womanhood. She said the whole thing was a matter of community. She was respectful and never blatantly demeaning, but the whole thing was very distressing to say the least. I’m not out to anyone else in my town, so I’m kind of desperate for support here. \n\nThe problem isn’t inherently in me being nonbinary, but rather in me being a nonbinary lesbian.

312,2019-11-06 04:03:26,dsawba,3,6,"Hi  all, just got a throwaway account to post here (not much of a reddit  person, but excited about the community). I'm sort of in the midst of  questioning my gender identity &amp; I guess I'm just curious if others  have had my experiences/see if there are some common threads?  Anyway,  this is kind of a long essay, so buckle up! I really hope some of y'all  take the time to read it though. TL;DR older afab person identified as  butch for a long time, now wondering about being genderqueer, would love  to get advice and guidance (or even just support and recognition) from  people who've experienced similar things! 

I'm  afab and have been a ""tomboy"" pretty much my whole life. I'm in my  early 30s and when I was growing up, in high school and college and  such, i was exposed to binary trans identities (in fact, my best friend  from high school transitioned FTM shortly after we graduated) and LGBTQ+  identities, but genderqueer/NB wasn't really a ""thing"" so much. In  college I pretty comfortably fell into the box of being a butch bi  woman, and gave myself permission to lean hard into the butchness after I  graduated. Recently, i've come to realize, mostly from knowing and  interacting with some younger queers, that if I had been born five or  ten years later, and grown up with this current generation, that I think  I would have identified as genderqueer. I feel like I fell into being a  butch woman because that was the best word I had to describe myself at  the time, but now maybe there are better words?

Only  now, have I started to really think about my relationship with my  gender. At first I was like, I can't be genderqueer, I'm definitely a  woman. But then I asked myself why I thought i was a woman (a question  which, believe it or not, I have never before felt comfortable  addressing) and I realized that the only times I really feel a strong  allegience to my gender at birth are when i feel discriminated against  or bullied because of my sex. Essentially, I only ever feel like a woman  when I realize I'm afraid to walk somewhere alone after dark and my cis  male friends aren't, or when I am at my job (in a very male dominated  field) and someone makes a sexist remark. This last part is especially  complicated for me, because this female solidarity has been very  important for me in getting through the training process at my job and  dealing with harrasment, and that kind of solidarity is something I  wouldn't want to give up if I embraced a genderqueer identity. But, when  I look inside myself, I really don't feel any particuar way about  gender. I don't feel like a woman at all. I don't feel like a man  either. If someone were to say to me, don't think about how others treat  you, just think about yourself, how do you know you're a woman? My  honest answer would just be, I don't.

After  a few months of such questioning, I started experimenting a bit with  presentation. I have always been quite butch, but never done much to  hide feminine elements of my body, and whenever I've had to go to a  formal event, I've worn a dress. In fact, I've always hated formal  events because they require navigating female formal wear, which has  always generated terrible feelings that I now recognize may have been  dysphoria. This summer, i went to a friend's wedding in a suit and I  felt glorious. I felt really handsome, like I looked good, a way I never  feel when I wear a dress. After a month of experimenting with sports  bras, I bought my first binder and found I enjoyed the look some days,  but not others (I'm small chested to begin with, but the way the binder  reduced my chest to nothing felt amazing on days when I wanted it). I  also started letting my body hair grow out, which I've been less  comfortable with (perhaps because it pushes my look over the androgenous  line and too far into male territory?).

Also  an NSFW addition \[mods please tell me if this paragraph doesn't abide  by group rules, I'll delete it--not meant to be explicit, just a part of  my experience that's been really important\] I started having strap on  sex, and holy fuck it's awesome. I've used a strap on before in several  previous relationships, but its always been one that's colorful and not  really dick shaped (#feminism lol). Even though I've been wearing it,  it's always been for my partner's pleasure if that makes sense, just  like, a more efficient way to use a toy, not a part of me. Well, this  summer I invested in a dick of my own, that looks about the same color  as my skin, and I...absolutely love it. Its not the only way I enjoy  having sex, but using it, solo or with my (cis male bisexual) partner  when I'm in the right mood has been amazing.

So,  all this to say, I'm excited about this journey. I still sometimes  wonder if I'm allowed the label of genderqueer. Am I just a butch woman?  I think a lot of this self doubt comes from being a bit older than most  of the people I see using the genderqueer label, and from feeling like I  just want to be me, and I don't want it to be like...a political label.  Also, I am all for other people using they/them pronouns, but I just  can't wrap my head around it for myself. Perhaps after 30 years of  thinking she/her, it's just a habit I won't be able to break? I've heard  from others that you don't need to use they/them pronouns to be NB or  genderqueer, but it still really makes me sad when I'm in ""woke"" spaces  and we go around and say our pronouns and I feel like saying ""she/her""  will imply to everyone else in the circle that I'm comfortable being a  woman (\*yes I know about the Contrapoints controversy kicked off by a  similar statement, and I'm in no way saying that pronoun go arounds are  bad, just that for me in particular, at this stage in my journey, they  are the opposite of validating!)

Anyway,  advice/thoughts/encouragement is welcome!

323,2019-11-06 08:26:10,dsdfv1,2,11,"This was posted on the Milk! Records Facebook page, which is home to my favorite musician, Courtney Barnett. Evelyn Ida Morris is a non-binary artist signed to Milk!. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbi-YkZ3ZtY) is a link to the song that's discussed.   


""Evelyn Ida Morris' cover of courtney barnett's tune ‘Nameless, Faceless’ from the forthcoming 'Milk on Milk' compilation is out now! Here's some words from Evelyn on the track...

“Courtney's song Nameless Faceless stood out as an obvious choice for me, mainly based on its content. I have really strong feelings about that fear that women have to carry. That silent, creeping fear that most women - especially trans women and women of colour - suffer through their whole lives. I had tried writing about this in a song maybe four years ago, when there was yet another incident of violence against a woman walking through a park in Doncaster, nearby where I grew up. I didn't release it, because I had struggled to make the topic feel like something I was proud of proclaiming in a chorus - which I think Courtney's song does beautifully. Before I knew I was non-binary, it was tricky proclaiming anything related to women because I didn't feel like I succeed at being a woman. It struck me that singing along with Courtney's song while also proclaiming my status as ""in-between"" was the perfect way to show my support to women, and to engage with the feeling that is inherent in my gender identity: that being a woman is a dangerous feeling for me. It is impossible for me to extricate the feeling of terror around having a body that is assigned female from the feeling of danger related to toxic masculinity - that moment we all experienced when we were little children, when suddenly we are told we can't take our shirt off in public, that we need to cover our bodies so that we are safe.

I know that I'm trans, but I'm not sure yet where I fit in on the spectrum. I think Morris's words  describe why I feel more non-binary than binary.

Records Facebook page, which is home to my favorite musician, Courtney Barnett. Evelyn Ida Morris is a non-binary artist signed to Milk!. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbi-YkZ3ZtY) is a link to the song that\'s discussed.   \n\n\n""Evelyn Ida Morris\' cover of courtney barnett\'s tune ‘Nameless, Faceless’ from the forthcoming \'Milk on Milk\' compilation is out now! Here\'s some words from Evelyn on the track...\n\n“Courtney\'s song Nameless Faceless stood out as an obvious choice for me, mainly based on its content. I have really strong feelings about that fear that women have to carry. That silent, creeping fear that most women - especially trans women and women of colour - suffer through their whole lives. I had tried writing about this in a song maybe four years ago, when there was yet another incident of violence against a woman walking through a park in Doncaster, nearby where I grew up. I didn\'t release it, because I had struggled to make the topic feel like something I was proud of proclaiming in a chorus - which I think Courtney\'s song does beautifully. Before I knew I was non-binary, it was tricky proclaiming anything related to women because I didn\'t feel like I succeed at being a woman. It struck me that singing along with Courtney\'s song while also proclaiming my status as ""in-between"" was the perfect way to show my support to women, and to engage with the feeling that is inherent in my gender identity: that being a woman is a dangerous feeling for me. It is impossible for me to extricate the feeling of terror around having a body that is assigned female from the feeling of danger related to toxic masculinity - that moment we all experienced when we were little children, when suddenly we are told we can\'t take our shirt off in public, that we need to cover our bodies so that we are safe.

during todays conversation, she told me that she has been trying, when talking about me, to just not use pronouns at all, instead referring to me as ""her oldest,"" or just by name. i didn't know this before, and it's definitely progress. 

however, she also said that she's feeling a strong emotional resistance to using they/them. she understands it intellectually and said that when others (coworkers, etc.) ask her to use they/them pronouns, she does, but that because i am her (adult) child and she's always known me as her daughter, she's feeling a sense of loss. she said she would keep trying, but kept adding that i can't expect it to happen soon (even tho i told her i know it will take time, so it just felt like a cop out). 

i'm at a loss at this point. how do i convey to her that it's really important for her to push thru the resistance? (for context, theres a complex in our relationship about me asking too much/not considering her feelings, so that complicates things).

373,2019-11-07 08:50:56,dsv35n,3,1,"I’ve found myself urging to date someone, I’ve been cold at night and it’s making me really bummed and depressed the next day - after all, in the past year I’ve learned so well that being single is really beneficial for my psyche. So why on earth am I having these feelings again when I was so peaceful in the past months?

Situation is not fun. It’s going to be a full year I didn’t have a date. I’m pan, but I’m also demi/gray ace so from my side it’s not all about sexual attraction, on the contrary I’m longing for something way more romantic. And also I’m super traditional when it comes to fidelity/monogamy. What are my prospects as such, and on top of all that being a non binary person?

Cis guys - Gay guys always chat me for a fun conversation in dark clubs before they realize I’m gender fluid and also not interested in anonymous sex so they dump me right there. Staight guys won’t even approach me because I’m not nowhere near to the female binary (nor I want to be at least not right now). So that’s a no.

Cis girls - I’ve had most «success» so far, but it’s equally a struggle as with guys. Lesbians won’t even talk to me and straight ones dump me right away when they feel how feminine I am (or as soon as they find out I’m on hrt). Bi girls, maybe. But I always feel they still like the traditional gender roles (roles that I absolutely despise). During my last dating urge back in spring I’ve talked to this person for one month, that was allegedly bi, before she finally dumped me saying she wants a «guy to have kids with». Another one decided «she wants a guy and a girl on the side». Ain’t nowhere near a fit.

Trans girls - I feel like they won’t ever talk to me, I feel like (maybe I’m wrong) that they are attracted to binary people only. Which is fine, but it’s no fit, also all the ones I met so far are poly, a big no go for me.

So why on earth am I having these feelings again when I was so peaceful in the past months?\n\nSituation is not fun. It’s going to be a full year I didn’t have a date. I’m pan, but I’m also demi/gray ace so from my side it’s not all about sexual attraction, on the contrary I’m longing for something way more romantic. And also I’m super traditional when it comes to fidelity/monogamy. What are my prospects as such, and on top of all that being a non binary person?\n\nCis guys - Gay guys always chat me for a fun conversation in dark clubs before they realize I’m gender fluid and also not interested in anonymous sex so they dump me right there. Staight guys won’t even approach me because I’m not nowhere near to the female binary (nor I want to be at least not right now). So that’s a no.\n\nCis girls - I’ve had most «success» so far, but it’s equally a struggle as with guys. Lesbians won’t even talk to me and straight ones dump me right away when they feel how feminine I am (or as soon as they find out I’m on hrt). Bi girls, maybe. But I always feel they still like the traditional gender roles (roles that I absolutely despise). During my last dating urge back in spring I’ve talked to this person for one month, that was allegedly bi, before she finally dumped me saying she wants a «guy to have kids with». Another one decided «she wants a guy and a girl on the side». Ain’t nowhere near a fit.\n\nTrans girls - I feel like they won’t ever talk to me, I feel like (maybe I’m wrong) that they are attracted to binary people only. Which is fine, but it’s no fit, also all the ones I met so far are poly, a big no go for me. \n\nNon binary folks - Honestly hardest one to meet, literally NOWHERE on dating sites and when I go out I’m so fucking shy to talk to a fun enby, and then I come up as a clumsy introvert, always a debacle. \n\nSo can someone please tell me what am I getting wrong here?

375,2019-11-07 11:38:27,dswimp,4,1,"This may sound quite odd but I don't have any friends I'm comfortable to talk about something so personal to me...

Starting off, I'm a 20M Asian gay guy who I can self-describe myself as softly effeminate, reserved and soft-spoken. Recently, I've been having growing feelings of the desire for people, mainly guys, to treat me as a straight female. The best I could explain it is with how some women wanting to be treated by their male friends like fellow 'bros' or 'homies', it's a reverse sentiment for myself, wanting my male friends and also guys in general to see me as a woman.

As a guy, I never hold many traits that I could consider masculine and I feel more comfortable being in touch with traits considered feminine. For one, I crave deep-rooted intimacy with my male friends and extremely affectionate with guys in general (when receptive or asked). I feel like I want to be nurturing, supportive... loving (not to reminisce a 1950s handmaids tale mind you). A guy I talked to online a while ago had once told me that: ""I have a mindset of a female"" (when I inquired why guy friends don't do platonic cuddling and I argued they should) and a good (straight) male friend to tell me that ""I make him warm and cozy"". Seeing it as a complement personally, it warms my heart and maybe it makes sense.

Strangely, I don't have any active desires to do makeup, crossdress or go out of my way to physically look like a woman as far as by undergoing an MtF transition but I like to being referred to as the woman especially when it comes to any preferred pronouns as ""she"" etc. (I don't mind with male pronouns). I've also started to give myself a name for my female persona... wanting to be called Cassie or Cassandra).

It may seem I'm purely romanticizing the woman experience by having guys fawn over females, but with my feminine traits, I'd want to use it to melt a man's heart, to make him more emotionally vulnerable and having that reciprocated when it comes to sharing personal things, whether it'd be just platonic or romantic. Right now, I feel wasteful in that I'm not making good use of my feminine traits, and not completely allowing myself to be easily comfortable around guys because I'm hiding a part of myself and when I do reveal it, guys tend to steer clear like I have a plague. I've never associated myself with the culture of bromance for obvious reasons and because of that, any underlying intimacy is light. It didn't feel fulfilling to me, I want something to transcend beyond just bromance and at the core of it, I desire guys whom I can completely trust without hesitation and be nurturing to them, to make them feel all gooey on the inside. In return, I want to be safe, feeling protected and the feeling that I matter to a guy.

To give a sense of the level of intimacy, I'm very open-minded and comfortable with... putting my head on a guy's chest... playing with his chest hair and listening to his heartbeat and deep breathing, being kissed on my forehead from time to time, sitting on a guy's lap to holding hands (which the same straight male friend asked me once and I didn't think anything of it)

I feel like I’m being treated like a woman by the cis men I work with.

Women being historically treated badly by men is just a historical facet society has always dealt with and is trying to fix, I understand that. But the environment in which I work in is somewhat known for cis men treating women badly. 

People tend to assume I’m cisgender because I’m pretty short and present femininely. Therefore, I feel like I’m treated with the disrespect they would project on women, and it’s really troubling for me. 

This is not to say I identify as non-binary in order to escape the mistreatment of being AFAB. Women must be entirely supported and treated well at all costs. But I can’t help but feel dysphoric when cis men treat me like this because I know they’re assuming I’m female.

433,2019-11-08 08:19:33,dtcfg8,8,1,"Cw: Non-binaryphobia(?), Christianity, dysphoria, abuse, depression, self-hatred

I had an actual discussion with my boyfriend about my identity in a phone call today. It was interesting because when I brought it up briefly in person, he seemed reserved and didn't actually want to tell me anything. He just had this face of disappointment. He told me he didn't really want me to change my body if I ever came to that decision. But now that we REALLY talked about it, he tells me that he's not buying into the whole ""more than one gender"" thing, that he's old school and proud. I have my own reservations about that but that's neither here nor there. What really got to me is that he said I was just confused, just tomboyish. I told him that part of my identity is partial agender and partial feminine, that it's not about being more boyish and less girly - I just wish I could be less gendered period. Then he says I'm not agender, I'm androgynous but that's not how I see myself as. Then he said that I was born a girl, I am his girlfriend. It hurt me so much but I'm still not 100% sure about using shey/shem/sheir pronouns so it's not like it matters.

If my boyfriend were any other guy, I'd have dumped him on the spot. But we truly love eachother, even despite... this. He told me straight up that he would support me as much as he could. So then I asked him pointblank if I were to get surgery, would he dump me. He said that he wouldn't mind as long as the surgery didn't turn me into an alien and made me look completely different where I was unrecognizable. He likes my body as it is but *I* don't. Unlike most people of his viewpoint, he doesn't want to disown me. He still loves me despite my dysphoria and not understanding non-binary. He said that he doesn't need to understand, he just refuses to accept the ""bull"". He thinks society has confused me. He believes God made me as I am. I'm a Christian but even with our beliefs in God, we don't see exactly eye to eye. Still, I DO believe that God doesn't make mistakes; hence why I still partially identify as female. But that doesn't change the fact that I am dysphoric about my body and feel like a prisoner in it.

Realistically, surgery is WAY too big of decision to make right now but the main issue of my dysphoria is weight so I'm hoping once I've got that under control, I can take care of other stuff. My other problem that is related (but not directly) is libido. It's part of my dysphoria and why I see myself as agender but I'm hoping that exercise will dim it enough to stop being a problem. And if it doesn't... Then I'm gonna have to find another solution or go straight for chemical castration. I'm too large to bind but if my breasts prove too unhealthy for my small frame and back, then I definitely want to get a reduction if I can. I'd like them gone period but that might be asking for too much anyway (not to mention it'd upset my boyfriend).

I wish I had never brought it up to my babe but I'm thankful for having someone in my life that cares about me. I'd rather have him than anyone else; I'd been waiting for him to return to me after we broke up years ago. We needed a fresh start and I wasn't as dysphoric about my gender back then. But now that I had this discussion, I'm questioning whether or not I'm truly non-binary or if I'm just clinging to demigirl as a way to visualizing my dysphoria; there's so much about my body that I'm dysphoric about that goes beyond gender. It's just made me even more confused - which makes me think he's right. I don't know what to do. I'm at the point where I just want to call myself body dysphoric, abandon all the stuff I identified as, and be done with it. I hurt so much and I'm at a loss. I'm just in a perpetual of self-loathing and have been for years (having an abusive stepmother who, among other things, forced femininity upon me as well as called me worthless didn't help). Even after I've moved far away from her, my own mother is just as deadset on her beliefs as my boyfriend but is a bit more accepting than him. I feel so alone (even though I'm surrounded by so many folk so feel as I do) and outnumbered. I'm just trapped; trapped inside a body that isn't mine. I told my boyfriend that and all he could say was that we would one day be in new bodies when God returns. I mean, I believe that but that doesn't help me in the moment.

Sorry if I'm rambling a bit, I just had to get this out, and this subreddit seems the right space. I still have difficulty finding the right words, as you might notice. 

I only recently accepted that i'm probably non-binary. I think i knew before, I just couldn't acknowledge it, if that makes sense? Instead I told myself at 17 that it doesn't matter what I am, as long as I am myself and do what I like. Well, it turned out that I liked to wear more masculine clothes, and present more androgynous. A month ago i cut my hair short, and I actually feel much more myself.

But the more I accept that I'm not a girl, the more I am getting bothered by the fact that others still percieve me as a girl. I get more aware of my body and often feel uncomfortable with the more feminine parts. Have any of you experienced the same after discovering that you're non binary? How did you deal with it?

I also don't really know what to do now. I have some friends I probably can talk with, but I don't really know how to approach this subject.

I have this sudden desire to pack and bind and I'm soooo confused  


Figured out I was nonbinary about 3 years ago. Mostly suffer from social dysphoria - don't want to be perceived as a woman, or femme, or female. Don't want to be perceived as a man, or masc, or male. Don't perceive my body as gendered, so not a lot of body or genital dysphoria. I mean it'd be fun to have all the bits, but I don't feel like I'll die if I don't have them. I don't have any chest dysphoria that I'm aware of. Mostly I have strong 'PLEASE DO NOT BINARY GENDER ME' feels that can be really really rough. Like 'I cannot leave the house or wear the skirts I love cause people will think I'm a woman so I wear a pronoun badge at all times so I can stand to public' rough.  


So mostly I use just 'nonbinary' cause my answer to 'are you a binary gender' is a huge 'NO' but wondering lately if what I'm describing is closest to 'agender' if I'm gonna be specific. I use genderqueer too cause messing with/fucking with gender is a big part of my presentation I guess? Ugh why is it all so complicated bleh.  


But although I am the first to be like 'presentation isn't gender, there are no masculine or feminine things, you can be nonbinary with any presentation' etc, I've usually had a strong knee jerk 'yerk' about being perceived as masc, and a real stubborn resistance to this whole idea that I gotta lean masc in order to be perceived as nonbinary. 

Buuuuut I have to admit a whole lotta butch women and nonbinary folks are like, presentation goals a bunch of the time for me (K.D. Lang anyone? Oomph what a fox). I am a confused enby I guess. I love my waistcoats and frock coats and swashbuckling shirts, and don't see them as masculine.  But I love my skirts and corsets and refuse to see them as feminine. I have no problem with the bits I have, but also enjoy strapon play and am no stranger to queering sex/sexuality. My partner is nonbinary too and I'm mostly attracted to other enbies and GNC folks. I'm processing a lot y'all. I wish everything didn't come with a load of gendered baggage.  


I've never before felt any urge to bind, or pack tho. I like to be what I call 'cutesome' or 'enby dapper' a bunch of the time but these are not feels I've had. Now yesterday BAM 'hey I wanna bind and pack, that'd be fun and kinda hot, here's a groovy image of swaggering about town being all dapper' comes into my head and I'm kinda '???!!!!!??????Ahhhh? Brain where did that come from? WHY. What is going on? What has changed?'   


Like I know neither of these things (to my mind) are inherently gendered. I can be an agender enby and want to do these things. I'm just surprised cause there wasn't even a hint of this kinda desire and it's got me befuddled... Well idk. I do know I was attracted the idea of doing the Drag King thing once upon a time (I sing) but my less-enlightened brain was like 'that's for binary people' (which I know is wrong, now, but that's newish for me) so I wrote it off. Perhaps this \*has\* been a thing and I've just put it on the 'nope' pile in my brain, and now it's working it's way back out?

450,2019-11-08 19:39:05,dtkjk2,2,1,"No flair because the “Yay” tag feels horribly out of place considering context but I guess this is still technically a win, albeit one nestled in sad circumstances.

Came out earlier this year and posted about it on Facebook before coming out to my parents. I love my parents but they made my coming out really...really weird.

They expressed support when I came out over Whatsapp one evening (I still feel like a coward for not being able to tell them in person despite all of us being adults, but frankly I was so scared), but later sat me down for a talk about things that just went *so badly*. Not in a bigoted or dangerous way, but they chose the worst timing for the talk and were clearly struggling with the concept of my not being female. My dad wouldn’t even hug me when I started crying and my mum told him to hug me.

I cried all the way to work and then just kept crying most of the day. Things have been “fine” since  but the subject of my gender or wanting to transition hasn’t come up since. I can’t take the emotional turmoil of a new conversation and nobody’s cared to check in with me on what pronouns or name I want to be using.

Very sadly, a friend of the family died about a week or two ago after years of health problems. We went to his funeral today. He and his wife were good friends of my parents, and their kids thusly became friends with my sibling and I. We’d go and visit the family or they would come to us maybe once a year, before us kids started growing up and had uni, shift work and boyfriends.

Keeping in mind that nobody save for my (Ultimate Of All Allies) boyfriend and one or two good friends gives a single shit about recognising my gender, at the funeral today one of the daughters thought to ask if I was now going by the name I originally came out with on Facebook. It was very awkward...I was caught totally off guard could feel the curious eyes of her other companions on me as I stuttered that I’d changed my mind on the name, but I’m so touched that she thought to check even in her moment of grief.

When I spoke with her mother/the wife of the deceased, she told me she missed seeing me on Facebook, and also asked about what name I was going by. She hugged me tight and told me that she understood and would always love and support me no matter what. I definitely started to get wet eyed all over again.

That talk I had with my folks ruined me on the name I’d chosen for myself and essentially threw a brick in my path since I now feel like I can’t transition while still as home for sake of causing friction. It hurts a lot that I didn’t get that kind of open-armed response from them. But it means so much to know there are people close to my family who do support me. That gives me hope that maybe things will improve in future, if my folks can see that other people have no problem with it...

I’m scared for all the times and ways I’m going to have to come out to people in the future, but I’ll hold our friends’ acceptance close to my heart and draw strength from it knowing that I’m not an unimaginable freak to everybody and that I have people I can turn to if I need it (even if they live hours from us, alas).",NonBinary,Bittersweet experiences at a funeral,1573267145.0,"{'created_utc': 1573241945, 'id': 'dtkjk2', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'No flair because the “Yay” tag feels horribly out of place considering context but I guess this is still technically a win, albeit one nestled in sad circumstances.\n\nCame out earlier this year and posted about it on Facebook before coming out to my parents.

I won't go into long details in a post, but I am realizing I'm uncomfortable with my genitals. Is there any other person who made genital and or top changes without a full on medical transition? (I can't come out to family as enby)

I came across some porn actress's subreddit a while back when trying to search about this and she was using t gel to get bottom growth, but wasn't taking enough to induce other changes (body hair, voice changes etc...). That sounds perfect for now.

From my understanding being nonbinary essentially comes down to ""I use they/them pronouns, I wear whatever I like, don't deadname me, please. and it's not your business to question or comment any of the above other than telling me how fabulous I look in this outfit"" and that's pretty straightforward to learn, If it's anything more or less than that feel free to correct me.

I'm not sure how to tackle the social pressures of being Non-Binary, my stories normally just pretend that everyone is fine with everyone else's gender/race/sexuality because those stories main themes come down to ""don't be a bigoted asshole"". However, since N-B people are rarely addressed in media, would it be more helpful if my story opened up an opportunity for people to be informed about N-B people and how some comments/questions that you think are neutral are actually offensive, Or would it be enough to show people just not being that kind of asshole to begin with?

So what should I do? should I go down the ""don't be a bigot"" route (nothing wrong with it but it should be a given at this point) or should I just assume that my audience already knows what a bigot does and just write my story as if everyone knows what appropriate and inappropriate to ask people except little kids?

I've also searched the wider internet as well as this community and I haven't seen people ask quite this type of detail, which might just be that I did a bad job searching for it.

I'm an AFAB person, I currently identify as a lesbian. I know of nonbinary lesbians so I have this vague knowledge that that's possible/an option. I've dated binary cis and trans women. I would date nonbinary people basically so long as they didn't feel like misgendered by my label and weren't, say, a demi boy or gender fluid and sometimes a man.

If asked on a form, I normally say that I'm a cis woman. I tend to be she/her'ed by people and that doesn't feel bad. I have been he/him'ed by people and that also doesn't feel bad. I haven't really been they/them'ed before but I imagine that would also feel fine. If I am described as a woman by other people, I'm fine with that.

However, as I've been around more progressive groups I find that I really hate saying that I ""identify"" as a woman. It feels to me like gender is a coercive system used to control people. Within that system, I guess I'm a woman bc whatever, but I don't feel like it's an inherent truth in my bones or something. If I hadn't been coercively placed here I wouldn't be here but I guess I am here now.

Like I find myself getting distressed answering that my pronouns are she/her, but I also know that I've seen cis people told not to do the ""any pronoun is fine"" stuff. and if I did that, overwhelmingly I would still be she/her'ed probably.

It's like if you had a shitty person controlling your life for a while and they filled your wardrobe with a single outfit. And technically you could make a different outfit or alter the ones you have or whatever. But it would be a lot of work, so you haven't and you might never do any of that, bc you don't actually care that much about the outfit. But for some reason every day you go out, you felt forced to say that you chose that outfit even when it's not true.

Heads up that I live in Massachusetts, one of the most liberal states in the US, so you may face more issues. On mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.

I first brought up wanting to try HRT during my yearly doctor appointment in June. The nurse said they didn't handle HRT stuff, as well as laughed when I mentioned wanting to get sterilized. She did run some blood and thyroid tests that came in handy a couple months later, but overall it was a really dissapointing appointment. I'm honestly happy I plan on moving across country for grad school and will have to get a new doctor.  After that experience I was pretty put off and decided to wait until school started up in the fall to try again.

Once I got to school I decided to try the local Planned Parenthood. If you have a Planned Parenthood near you DEFINITELY go through them! The women on the phone was wonderful when I made the appointment, was super respectful and made sure she was using the proper pronouns and name for me. Honestly the worst part was the my appointment was October 24th, as their HRT doctor was booked until then. So another couple months of waiting.

Onto October 24th. I had to take the day off of classes, and really recommend telling your teachers beforehand that you have a serious medical appointment. They tend to excuse you without asking questions if you phrase it like that. My partner took me since I was nervous and I wanted the support. Once we got to the Planned Parenthood they had the both of us step through a scanner before letting us into the actual clinic. The receptionist took my ID, insurance card, and double checked my preferred pronouns and had me wait for only a few minutes before I was seen.

The appointment itself took about an hour and a half. They took vitals before walking me through all the options of how to take testosterone, and after we chose gel form, explained where to apply it and when. Never was I questioned on my transness or validity of my gender identity. Both the nurse and doctor were respectful the entire time. Since my doctor had run most of the blood and thyroid tests that PP would have run they allowed me to just bring up my online medical records and looked them over there. They didn't have to do any testing that day and I left with prescriptions for birth control and Testogel.

This was honestly the hardest part. My insurance (Aetna) required a prior authorization and denied it when they found out I wasn't binary trans, saying it wasn't an FDA approved usage. Luckily mom had already been switching insurance and November 1st moved us all to Blue Cross Blue Shield, which meant I needed to have Planned Parenthood refile a prior authorization. But this time it was accepted eventually! The next hurdle was the CVS, for some reason they didn't contact me that the gel was ready and I only found out when I called today it had been filled Saturday. The woman who handled me was a little weird about it all and made me consult with the pharmacist, who warned me it may cause my prostate to enlarge and not to let women or children take it lol.

I realize I got lucky that I didn't have to go through all the hoops so many of us have to. I hope that writing out my experience helps someone else get their HRT.

I thought about a so-called ""queer constant"" which is a percentage of LGBT+ people in a population. And I thought that sexualities from most common to least common would make an infinite series, say 1 is lesbian/gay, x is bisexual, x\^2 is trans, x\^3 is nonbinary, etc.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor\_series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) .

 I was born female and have been fine with that for about 20yrs or so. I have no doubt I'm feminine, I love being feminine. 

So where's the rub? 

Well it all started when I may or may not have used a substance that may or may not have out body elements. While dissociation is a common side effect the things I experienced there and felt have stuck with me ever since. Namely how I kept referring to my name as she/her but me or I was always a different entity. Basically my brain broke things down like this. Sex/genitals = very very bad. Both had gender and neither had anything to do with ""me-ness"" (By the way I already know I'm demisexual/ace spectrum). My name = a girl that I lived with but not me. Me/myself= as a genderless identity just having a good time. And I really ...really really liked that. I shared this experience with my Trans Dad (one of my best friends who also is a trans man and LGBTQ youth counselor). And he just quite frankly said that he never thought of me as Cis but that is wasn't his place to inform me of that. My partner also brought up how I hate the idea of pregnancy, love the idea of raising children with gender, regularly shop among men &amp; womens clothing, and am comfortable going by any pronouns. I've gone by both masculine and feminine nicknames but my favorite is what my D&amp;D party calls me: Bees.  I don't really plan to start going by they/them except maybe with friends, quite frankly I don't care what pronouns anyone calls me. But I like the idea of not being a man or woman but just being...me.

but as time has gone on, feels like it turned into a clique of mostly older transwomen. Even though trans masc and non-binary people were in chat, it wasn’t uncommon to hear a “hello ladies!” greeting. Again, didn’t outwardly bother me, as i was aware women were mostly dominating the chat, but still, alienating gestures just sort of kept increasing.

Meanwhile whenever one of the ladies gets like, a new shade of lipstick, everyone is gassing up her selfie and being supportive and actually interested. Not like people should just force themselves to care but.. it just really kept getting to me how basically any opinion or attempt at conversation from people who aren’t ladies gets basically ignored.

It came to a breaking point yesterday. One lady was posting some half baked article about non-binary identities and kind of, for lack of better word, mansplaining it (I don’t say that word to misgender, it just really illustrates how she was acting like an authority on the topic while also butchering it).

Then she says the doozy “don’t hate me I just don’t think transgender issues and non-binary issues are related” or some really dumb shit like that. Just outright invalidating so many people in chat that the room was also created to support.

First off I come from a non-english speaking country.

Today, I got to hear firsthand how being out can also be a way of sort of giving back. One of my long-time coworkers based in Texas has had some issues remembering my pronouns. She's made so much progress with remembering over the last year or so, even as we've moved to different teams.

772,2019-11-14 20:42:01,dwfi6z,0,1,"Hi Folx,

My state just approved a gender of X on photo IDs, woo!  My employer has the policy that you have to use the bathroom matching your ID, which is already a regressive policy, boo!, but on top of that we don't have that many ungendered bathrooms, double boo!  Thankfully, I'm unionized, I trust my union rep to be okay with me coming out to them as nonbinary, and to keep my name private until it's needed, so I wrote them a letter in the hopes that the union can work with my employer to fix this, so I can safely change my ID.

In case anyone else would like to see this letter to use as a model either to their union or to their employer, here it is (appropriately redacted for privacy):

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Hi *$Name$*,   
&gt;  
&gt;I'm hopeful you'll keep my name confidential from this inquiry for as long as possible.  If you think it would be helpful to disclose my name to anyone, I would appreciate it if you discussed with me beforehand.    
&gt;  
&gt;As you may be aware, the *$State DMV$* has just begun to allow gender markers on driver's ID of not only M (male) and F (female), but also X (nonbinary).  *$Employer$* has previously told us that it is policy that employees should use the bathroom that matches the gender on their photo ID.    
&gt;  
&gt;I am considering changing the gender marker on my driver's license to a gender of X.  This means that if *$employer$* follows the policy above, I would technically be forbidden to use women's restrooms, despite ""looking female"".  But on top of that, it would also be difficult for me to use **any** bathroom: Out of the seven buildings on *$employer's$* main campus, I would only be allowed to use the bathroom in four buildings, and students with an X on their license would have only three bathrooms unless they got faculty/staff permission.  *$Further detail on existing bathrooms that I'd be allowed to use, and about where my office/meetings are located.$*  
&gt;  
&gt;Would it be possible for the union to (1) discuss this issue with the employer, or whomever it is that passed down this rule that we can only use the bathroom that matches the gender on our ID, **and** for the union to (2) get a verbal agreement from the managers that while this is being sorted out, no union members (or ideally, others as well) will be ""no-trespassed"" or otherwise punished for simply using a bathroom (regardless of the bathroom's gender and the person's ID)?   
&gt;  
&gt;What I would like to see long term, is a policy that does both of the following: 

1. Allows people to use whatever bathroom they want, regardless of their gender marker on their ID.  (I'm not out as being nonbinary at work.  If this policy forced me to use only ungendered bathrooms, I would be put in the position of having to choose between violating the policy and risking being ""no-trespassed"", or following the policy and ""outing"" myself which could be unsafe for me.)  
2. Designates one third of bathrooms as being available to all genders (male, female, and nonbinary).  These all gender / gender neutral bathrooms can be either ""single seater"" or ""multi-seater"", so long as they are located at ADA-acceptable distances from all locations, and an ADA-acceptable proportion of them are accessible.  

&gt;This exclusionary bathroom policy at my place of employment is currently the biggest hurdle standing in the way of my correcting my gender on my driver's license.    
&gt;  
&gt;Again, I would prefer if you could keep my name private for the time being, but you can share this email with my name removed.    
&gt;  
&gt;Thank you for your time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sincerely,

My pcp almost instantly submitted referrals for me for the surgeries I want, but then she told me that there was a 6 month wait to get a surgery letter from a provider there, and that I should look for an alternative place to get the two letters I need.  She told me to go to a clinic run by UCSF, but when I called them to make an appointment they wouldn't take me because I don't live in San Francisco. The other resources she gave me were all walk-in clinics that are only open during times that are really inconvenient for me, so I was having a hard time figuring out when I would even be able to initiate that process.  Finally I got a call from a scheduling coordinator at Lyon-Martin telling me one of their therapists could meet with me for an intake appointment, and I asked them if this therapist could write one of my surgery referral letters.  They told me no, they could not, and pointed me back in the direction of one of the inconveniently timed walk-in clinics.  I agreed to schedule the intake appointment anyway, because I could still use the therapy, but I ended up cancelling it due to a last minute conflict.  A week later, the therapist themself called me, and I asked them directly if they would be able to provide a gender surgery letter.  They said possibly!  I had the appointment today, and after briefly talking about my dysphoria and my goals for surgery, they scheduled me a surgery letter evaluation for next month, and said that if they determine me to be a good candidate for surgery they'll get me an appointment with a second therapist for my second letter.

Naturally, I'm so relieved to have the appointment made.  Progress feels so joyful and I'm so excited to be one step closer to feeling at home in my own body, but I'm incredibly angry about being downright lied to.

So many people talking about their experiences on T are average or skinny or generally just no where near my build or weight, and I really want to hear from someone around my size how it affected them, or how they dealt with it.\n\nPreventing hair loss is a huge priority, because my hair is like... the biggest way I express myself. Though I dont think significant hair loss runs in either sides of my family very strongly, its still this big anxiety of mine.\n\nSorry for a big rambly wall of text.

It wasn’t until I started to learn more about non-binary people recently that I realized that’s truly what I’ve felt my entire life.

Here are my questions and I apologize in advance if they’re a bit ignorant since this is a whole new space for me:

Is it okay if I don’t have a preferred pronoun? I’m okay with being called she/her, they/them, he/him. I have thought about in a situation where I’m being introduced to someone else, they/them is best, but I don’t mind if someone refers to me as she/he.

How should I tell people? I’m a graphic designer so I was thinking about posting about it on my Instagram account with a nice graphic but would love to hear how others have done it.

What do your partners introduce you as? It can’t be “this is my girlfriend/boyfriend” so curious what everyone else uses.

however, i don't have dysphoria with my vagina, nor do i have problems with having long hair. when i need to go to the restroom i go into the women's restroom without much afterthought and i subconsciously fit myself into the ""woman"" category when i read things online talking about women as a whole. yet i hate being referred to as a woman myself, and feel awful when people use gendered terminology on me. i also have been having trouble for the past few months with regards to anything concerning gender. i spent too long thinking about whether or not i should write ""f"" on all papers, intentionally omitted giving out my pronouns whenever mass group introductions were done, and generally felt anxious acknowledging anything my gender. i also tend to play as the male character in video games possibly because i don't want to think about playing as ""myself,"" and recently while reading visual novels w/people at gatherings i've felt off about being auto-assigned to voice act the female character. also dunno if this is relevant but as a result of playing a male character in an mmorpg (as well as having a gender neutral username), people used he/him/his pronouns on me, which felt all right. actually in general all of the most common pronouns feel okay to me, even she/her/hers, although i reject being called a woman still...

It seems like low- or micro-dosing T is a popular opinion for nb people who want to minimize their feminine features/gain masculine ones/strike androgyny. I've considered this option heavily as I would be excited about the body and face masculinization. 

However, I don't have a problem with my voice and would actually prefer to preserve it. I was trained classically as a soprano and have a decently high range.

so for the past almost 10 years, i have gone by a different name than the one i was given at birth, and my birth name, for reference, is a traditionally feminine name. however, my state recently passed a change that allows people to put their gender on the license/ID as nonbinary, which is super awesome!

941,2019-11-17 23:43:37,dxuqz7,0,1,"I’m not like other girls. It’s a cliche, overused phrase, but it holds true for me in particular. I have only met one other woman who had a beard, and it was not nearly as robust as mine. I inherited the body hair of my mother’s side of the family, so unless I am giving myself a daily wax there is no way to avoid looking like a werewolf. Thus, I am keeping my beard as an artistic expression of my nonbinary, trans self. 

Why should I have to change my body to be who I am? I used to beat myself up over not being the petite epitome of feminine - an I mean literally hitting myself because I’m an emotional roller coaster who hated myself. But, I have since learned to love who I am as I am. I am enough and I don’t need to radically change or even mutilate my body to express my innermost feminine feelings.

Of course, this sets me apart from society as a whole. Before I moved to Portland, I became the local spectacle in my hometown of Syracuse just for wearing a skirt. I feel a lot of healing has happened since moving to the west coast where I can reflect my identity in my choices much more freely without consequences. 

Still, I am odd. That’s a given, being that I am schizoaffective as well. It makes life a bizarre roller coaster in addition to dealing with my identity issues. I like to describe my condition as being bipolar but the aliens are abducting me to save me from the CIA which is trying desperately to create a reality TV show about my life. I am often in an eccentric self-generated narrative about what I am doing at any given moment. My purpose is always changing, as is how I am perceiving different events.

Naturally, you can expect that this adds a lot of pressure onto me for fitting in. And that’s the thing - I don’t. In a society that is so radically split into dichotomous us vs. them thinking, I proudly stand out against the even background. I am a dodecahedron in a world full of square and round holes. I don’t have many friends, but those I do have are true companions that I genuinely am grateful to have in my life.

I am homeless, but part of that is by choice. My entire experience spiralling onto the streets has been a radical transformative event, and I continue to seek authentic human experiences to expand my horizons. By regularly being forced outside my comfort zone, I have been actively reconditioned to be much freer than I once was. My perception of self has changed to the point where I don’t need any reassurance from other people to find solace with myself of my actions. I am as I am, and I am happy and grateful that I get to be me; an alien on my homeplanet.

Basically, what I’m trying to say is that you should believe in yourself and go confidently about your day. If I can survive in this world on the farthest fringe of the bell curve, then that is proof that it doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like. If I can find happiness in a world that has been designed for people that are in no way like me, then that is definitive proof that happiness is completely self-defined.

#  TODAY was the first day I was able to leave the house with my nails painted, I felt terrified and happy at the same time

my mother painted them and the nervousness begun by asking her to help me LOL and her answer was

""I find it a little strange a man with painted nails but if you want it then come here and I’ll help you""

(Daaaam I was happy hahaha)

(Who knows me knows I’m bisexual, but not everyone is aware of my non-binary status, just my closest friends)

The most confusing part for me is that I already draw a lot of attention 

I am 5'10 (around here this height is considered tall) 

my hair is a curly mane that I am very proud of 

and at the moment I wear beard and 3 pairs of hoop earrings

Considering the culture and religiousness from this whereabouts, it's a lot for the “regular folk” to take it in hahahaha

but even with all of this, painting my nails has always been something I struggled with

&amp;#x200B;

and then two things happened

1 - the uber drive, literally the first person who saw my hands, crooked his face... and i was sad at first, the only person that saw it gave me a terrible look like it was an ugly and damn thing. Even though i was kinda waiting for, it hurt a little.

&amp;#x200B;

2 - I arrived at my friends place, we were having this little late Halloween party, and then some responded with surprise and most loved it hahahaha  

I even forgot about the uber driver and I was so happy that I'm still silly about it

&amp;#x200B;

it's amazing to me that something apparently so small can mess with me so much and make me so happy

it was nervousness, sadness, happiness and then a feeling of acceptance that warmed me inside

and it was this community that helped me gather the courage for it today so THANK YOU ALL 

who shared your photos and stories here, it really helped me and I won't stop here

TLDR at the bottom. 

Here's some background. I've been identifing as a trans guy for a long time now but when I was first trying to figure out my gender and expression, I identified as genderfluid. Not too long later, I just got the idea of having to be binary and really did connect with being FtM (and still do). I've always been open to using he/him/they pronouns and definitely do. A while ago I asked a trans support blog if someone could be ftm and non-binary which they informed me you definitely can! That made me feel so vaild because sometimes I don't feel necessarily just a ""man"" if anything, I like to see myself as just me. Okay, but here's the actual thing I'm trying to say, most of my friends and things see me as a guy and are very nice, especially one who basically came out as trans soon after I did. I've been trying to think of a way to say I'm an enby (trans?) guy without being scared of maybe people thinking I'm not ""trans enough"" or ""guy"" enough or just assuming because I am this way, maybe they'll see differently of me or even the idea of being ""too supportive"" forcing themselves to use they/them on me and quit using he/him all together. Sometimes I casually bring up being okay with more neutral gendering things but that seems to confuse people, either not knowing what to say or thinking it's because I'm just not 100% passing, that it's a social thing. Another really big concern if mine is I'm only in the closet to my immediate family and when my girlfriend stayed with me I told her to please use they/them around my sister and basically she said that she couldn't do that without even giving it a second thought about trying. That low-key broke my heart because I think if I tell her she won't understand and if she does accept it I don't think she'll keep that in mind at all.

Does anyone have experience with coming out as NB after identifying with a binary gender for such a long time? How was it? How did you go about explaining it to people you know or even strangers? Do you just let people think you're binary? Help. :(

Some months ago, I started to play a DnD 5ed short campaing and I need to create a character. So when I begin to think how he/she/they would be, I thought ""Why not a non binary character?"" It must perfectly valid to play it. And would be a nice way to put some representation on the game (and as I far I know, nearly all on the table never meet a trans person, so it could be educative)

So, I made they as a wood elf druid, oriented to use wild shaped to adopt different animal forms. I always describe they as a very androgynous look, being hard to read they as female or male. But, I try to make a bit more masculine or feminine every few days.
When they take the form of an animal, they switch the visible sexual organs so not always are the same (a good thing of a fantasy RPG is that I can do it! )

The background lore it's that they born and live a lot of time with wood elf tribes in the deep of the forest, and later enter on a druid circle. As his people have a deep know of the nature, they know that his gender is totally natural and always treat they with respect. So they hadn't live any kind of oppression or discrimination for being non binary. They like to take animal shaped very often, as it allow to switch his gender expression on a deeper way that they could do on his elf shape.

I really like playing they. I find the druid class funny to play and I think that his usage of wild shape, it's what any trans druid character would like to do.

I played they four sessions (one one-shot, and 3 on the main campaign) and they is working very fine on the group. On the first session, the other players had some confusion with they (I never declared the gender of they, and I keep changing between femenine and masculine when I talk about they), but besides of some little on rol joke, it's going very well. Even, on the last session, someone had the thought that they is trans.

I like to ask as a cis male, what I could do to play they better. I'm doing something bad with the way that I'm trying to represent a non binary character on game ? I'm worried about if I could being falling on some stereotype...

I find the druid class funny to play and I think that his usage of wild shape, it\'s what any trans druid character would like to do.\n\nI played they four sessions (one one-shot, and 3 on the main campaign) and they is working very fine on the group. On the first session, the other players had some confusion with they (I never declared the gender of they, and I keep changing between femenine and masculine when I talk about they), but besides of some little on rol joke, it\'s going very well. Even, on the last session, someone had the thought that they is trans.\n\nI like to ask as a cis male, what I could do to play they better. I\'m doing something bad with the way that I\'m trying to represent a non binary character on game ? I\'m worried about if I could being falling on some stereotype...\n\n(PD: English isn\'t my mother language, so I sorry if I write something wrong or on a weird way)', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Playing a enby elf Druid', 'created': 1574122901.0}"

I tried searching for an answer, but couldn't find anything, so apologies if there was a similar thread.

Don't want to bore you with the story of my life, but basically I'm an afab non-binary. My brain is pretty much androgynous, but I kinda identify with both genders (sometimes more with female, sometimes more with male, but it's never 100%) and - the most frustrating thing ever - can experience dysphoria directed towards both feminine and masculine attributes of my body. It depends.

I tried to live as a male. I tried to live as a female. And I just can't stick to one, though my social dysphoria gets better when I'm treated as a guy (or in a gender neutral way). Sooner or later I feel the need to switch.

And here's the thing: switching means either going on T or going off T. I've done that a few times over the years (the longest I've been on T was 1.5 years, then I took a ~2 year break, sometimes I would go on T once or twice a year for a few months). It's the only way I can feel comfortable in my body - having this choice. But I'm worried it might be unhealthy and potentially dangerous. I don't want to mess up my body. I'm afraid it might be the reason why my hair falls out sometimes (like right now. It's really scary). I'm gonna visit an endocrinologist soon, but so far everything was fine, nothing outside the norm, both when I let my body produce natural hormones and when I take shots.

Also, I always wait at least a couple of months to half a year before I switch, so I try to be as regular as possible and never make those decisions randomly out of blue without giving myself plenty of time to think about it. But I can't help getting worried anyway.

I came out to my wife of 2 years Saturday, and she was very understanding and supportive, but also understandably confused and anxious. For those of you who have been in similar situations, how did you build reassurance and expand understanding with your spouse and use your newfound understanding of gender to further strengthen your relationship? Are there any subthreads or resources I can refer her to? Everytime she searches on her own, she ends up at gendercritical and it takes her a few minutes to realize they're not there to help us.

And now for the longer version: 

I'm 33 AMAB, been married a little over two years now, and I've struggled with my gender my entire life - but I never really was able to wrap my head around what I felt or what I was. As a practicing Christian from a more conservative religious upbringing in the South, there was a lot of shame early on, wanting to be more feminine and wishing I could be both a girl and a boy. I'd wonder if I was gay, or later if I was trans, and then assure myself I was a cis straight male because that's how God made me. I'd buy cute feminine clothes and then later purge my closet, repeatedly.

A few months ago though, I was listening to a podcast, I don't remember which one, and they were discussing the terms nonbinary in depth - and all of a sudden everything finally made sense! It's probably the only time I've ever really felt gender euphoria, and it was great. However, I still didn't feel comfortable being out in public or even with people I'm close with. I've always presented as hyper masculine - a nice thick beard, a 300lb+ bench, football, wrestling, lacrosse - you get the picture. I'm afraid the contrast would be too much for most people in my life to handle. 

My wife however, is a wonderful, loving person who shares my faith, but comes from a much more progressive West Coast background. She doesn't identify as bisexual, but she freely admits she has some bisexual tendencies, which I've been totally cool with. This weekend, I finally decided to come out to her as a nonbinary bigender person, just hoping the whole time that she really was the loving understanding person I fell in love with. 

And she is. Y'all she was so great! The first thing she did was take me to her closet to see if I liked/could fit in any of her clothes and asked if I wanted to wear any of her jewelry, then the next day we went and got our nails done together! I only did my toes though (neon purple!) because definitely still uncomfortable being out in public. But it was such a great experience. I just want to make life as easy and encouraging for her as she goes through this journey with me as she's already made it for me, and I'd love any advice or input.

1077,2019-11-20 09:13:09,dyzkpq,3,1,"New to the sub, not new to being trans/nb. Been out since 2015. I just really need to braindump this somewhere where folks will at least have some idea of what I'm dealing with. My therapist of 5 years passed away on November 3rd so I haven't had a space to really talk about these things. I'm specifically looking for support in the form of sympathy/empathy and positive encouragement. I know some of the things below are not healthy and suuuuuper internalized transphobia (hence the title); that's why I'm looking for a new therapist. :) My internalized transphobia is not a commentary on anyone else but myself.

I identify as nonbinary/agender (they/them). I'm decently vocal about it. I post a lot about using proper pronouns on fb and my friends have been getting a lot better at using the correct ones. I've worked for LGBTQ nonprofits for the last three years where I've been gendered correctly, and now I have business cards with my pronouns on them! It's very exciting. I'm really bad at correcting people when misgendering happens but that's on me.

But I'm feeling really distant from myself. I don't take pictures or selfies anymore. I kind of actively avoid cameras because I don't like what I look like. I hate all of my clothes yet don't know what I would wear if I could go buy new clothes. I've lost 20lbs and the scariest thing for me is to show off my body anywhere but the gym. I think my trans body - 4yrs on T, almost 3yrs post-top surgery - is revolting and not something that should be considered attractive. The way I look/present right now is incompatible with how I see myself.

I haven't always seen myself this way. I used to love taking pictures and selfies. It's actually since I started going to the gym that these feelings have really manifested. I guess I thought if I got in shape that I would feel better about my body (I've also got general body dysphoria - thanks, mom), but that has not been the case. I want to show off my hard work, yet I fear doing so will emphasize my transness. My gym is super supportive - we actually have a women &amp; nb only weightlifting class - but I still feel like a freak in how people perceive me as masculine due to my facial hair and how I wear women's yoga pants to exercise. 

And this drills down to the bigger problem at hand. I want to dress more femininely and feel cute again, but I'm terrified. Weirdly, I am less scared of potential violence than I am of being seen as ugly or a freak. Outside of work, I hang out in primarily cishet spaces and my friends are incidentally queer, as in, we're friends due to our interests and we both happen to be queer. (I used to hang out in a few trans only/majority spaces, but have since stopped due to time, interest, and drama.) Like I mentioned earlier, my cis friends are hella supportive and complimentary in whatever I wear or present. Even when they are being their most supportive, if I'm not wearing something masculine/androgynous (read: jeans + t-shirt), I feel like a freak. I love wearing dresses. They are so goddamn fun. I feel cute when I wear dresses. But when other people are suddenly factored in, I want to hide.

When it comes to dating/relationships, I've essentially shut off that part of me. I used to have crushes all the time. Now, there's no one I'm interested in. I think a bit of that has to do with the spaces I frequent, though there are plenty of queers in those spaces too. But I think I've so internalized my transphobia and my disgust toward my own body that I figure no one will want me, so what's the point?

The ironic thing to all of this, is that I've been hooking up with a girl from my gym for the last month. She came over last week and we had sex - the first time since I started transitioning in 2015. She was very patient and kind; I literally could not have picked a better person to go on this journey with me. It was easy for me to do things for her, but when she wanted to do things for me, I couldn't. I declined for a few reasons: inexperience (I can count my good sexual experiences on one hand), fear that I wouldn't like it, and most of all, confusion as to why she would want to do that. Why is she attracted to someone who looks like me, who has the body I do? And look, I'm really of two minds here. I have all this internalized transphobia and body dysphoria on the one hand, but on the other I know I am actually attractive (I was a child model, after all!). So I get what she's looking at and liking, but I truly don't understand why or why she'd want to have sex with me when she could easily find someone whose body makes sense. I know it's not up to me to determine how other people view me and that people can choose to see me however they want, positively and negatively. I'm still limiting myself because I have a certain image I want to uphold.

Also, the only people who seem to flirt with me are married/coupled cis women. I don't know what it is, but I have at least 4 who flirt with me and nothing can come of it.

I'm also in comedy, and I've been limiting myself in regards to that, too. I had my comedic voice all figured out pre-transition because it was really easy for me to be that woman who my father called a ""ball-buster"". Now that I appear male, I can't necessarily do that because I just look like a mean man, even when that's not who I am at all. I have 25yrs of identifying as a woman that informs my comedy! I did my time! So I just don't know what to do artistically. I still can't find my voice. 

And this is a totally separate aside, but I also hate writing scripts about the trans experience which isn't good since that's all anyone wants to hire me for. I have very little interest in writing trans narratives or specifically trans stories. Seeing as being a diversity hire might be my only ticket into a writer's room, I may have to become the trans comedy writer, instead of a talented comedy writer.

I want to love and celebrate my body in what it looks like and what it can do, but I'm currently trapped in a tornado of internalized transphobia, body dysphoria, and gender dysphoria. I want to get out but seeing as I'm nearly 30, I've lived with these issues for a long time and have tried lots of things that have not worked.

I\'m specifically looking for support in the form of sympathy/empathy and positive encouragement. I know some of the things below are not healthy and suuuuuper internalized transphobia (hence the title); that\'s why I\'m looking for a new therapist. :) My internalized transphobia is not a commentary on anyone else but myself.\n\nI identify as nonbinary/agender (they/them). I\'m decently vocal about it. I post a lot about using proper pronouns on fb and my friends have been getting a lot better at using the correct ones. I\'ve worked for LGBTQ nonprofits for the last three years where I\'ve been gendered correctly, and now I have business cards with my pronouns on them! It\'s very exciting. I\'m really bad at correcting people when misgendering happens but that\'s on me.\n\nBut I\'m feeling really distant from myself. I don\'t take pictures or selfies anymore. I kind of actively avoid cameras because I don\'t like what I look like. I hate all of my clothes yet don\'t know what I would wear if I could go buy new clothes. I\'ve lost 20lbs and the scariest thing for me is to show off my body anywhere but the gym. I think my trans body - 4yrs on T, almost 3yrs post-top surgery - is revolting and not something that should be considered attractive.

almost all of my irl friends are nonbinary or at least some other kind of trans, and i've been out to the group at large for almost a year now. however i'm the only amab person in the group, and sometimes that gets me in a spot of bother when gender is being discussed. 

one very close friend in particular i've had to all but stop talking to entirely for fear of being, ostensibly entirely unintentionally, made to feel super dysphoric and shitty. they're a nonbinary butch lesbian, and base all of their theoretical approaches to gender and gender politics on this abstract construct of ""womanhood,"" regularly presenting gender trauma and any conflicting or complex experience of gender to be something tied innately to being afab and/or a woman. they've even gone so far as to straight up say that any trauma due to being an amab nonbinary person is irrelevant except in relation to that of afab people and trans women.

of course, this is someone i know would never hurt me on purpose, and i'm sure if i went to them and brought it up we could eventually work out this specific problem, i've just been having a rough mental health time overall recently (its all  temporary and thus manageable dw) so i haven't wanted to expose myself to any more potential dysphoria until i'm in a slightly stabler place mentally. but the issue is not an isolated one, almost all of my friends have made me uncomfortable in some way or another when discussing gender (still workin on actually mentioning it when it happens, i'm a work in progress lol), and often when folks talk about trans people it seems what they actually mean is just afab trans people and trans women. i know *intellectually* that i as an amab person am just as trans as anyone else, and that my dysphoria and gender related trauma are perfectly valid, but fuck is it tough sometimes to bear that in mind and really internalize it when it seems to be something that even my closest and most trusted friends in the trans community disbelieve in on some level, or at the very least rarely remember.

i don't really know what the point of this post is meant to be, other than to get it off my chest and to present it to a wider group in hopes of getting some confirmation that this is in fact a wack situation and a wack phenomenon i guess. this sub is basically the only online community that seems actually 100% chill and cool and kind, so i figured i'd see if y'all had any  sage words or plain old good vibes to shoot my way. love all y'all 💕💕💕💕💕

**Tl;dr:**
I’m a confused trans masc enby trying to overcome the guilt I feel coming out to my parents. I feel like I’ve disappointed them by “being a trender” even though I *know* that’s my internalized fear and that they will support me unconditionally. My mom asks questions, though, and I balked the last two times I tried to talk to them about it. 

I told my parents last week that I started T “recently,” and I feel so bad about it that I want to stop entirely. I maybe didn’t come out as nonbinary very well, a couple months ago I said I was exploring my gender and my mom responded by saying not to get too hung up on labels. I just barely have a visible hint of a mustache, I’m really happy with where my voice is, and my leg hair and eyebrows have darkened nicely. 

I have been exploring my gender for a couple of years now. I went by Harry at Dunkin’ for almost a year, and have been using Eliot since before spring break. I’m out as Eliot to the local queer community and recently came out to some select family members, including my brother in law.

When I think about my transition so far, I am really happy. I’m excited to start having facial hair and to be involved with a social community that uses and respects my chosen name and pronouns. I kind of want to move job locations so that I can meet people as myself instead of having to come out and correct people or continue to be closeted and hide my transition from work. But when I think about my parents, I want to detransition completely. I want to wax my lip and throw out my T and buy new bras and apologize for being confused and hurting people with my mistake. 

My parents are very hip to non-binary genders and have always been LGBTQ+ allies, but I feel like my mom has always thought that I’m just trying to fit in with the community. I have a lot of gender-expansive friends now, I’m active in the local queer community, so maybe I just like feeling special and like I belong?

I guess I’m facing internalized stigma against nonbinary people and projecting that onto others, because I feel like I would have an easier time coming out to my parents as a trans man. But how do I explain that I want to transition to look more masculine so that I’m more comfortable presenting a little more feminine? 

She asked why I wanted to be on T and I couldn’t really explain it. I want to be mostly read as a “guy...?” when wearing pastels and nail polish. I want to wear just board shorts at the beach, and to look cute in EGL dresses. I want to be a gender chameleon, not tied down to one gender/presentation, and I feel like I couldn’t be that when I look butch or like a girly cis girl. I’m more of a femboy or “tomgirl” at heart, and I want to represent the part of me that always wished that I was born a boy so that I could play with dolls and wear dresses and subvert gender norms the way my brain has always wanted to. 

Typing this all out has reassured me that I really am legitimately some kind of trans person, and that I wish we had more non-toxic male icons in western culture. Also, it’s really hard for me to separate “I have a crush on this boy” from “I want to look like this boy.” But I’m getting there.

I want to be a gender chameleon, not tied down to one gender/presentation, and I feel like I couldn’t be that when I look butch or like a girly cis girl. I’m more of a femboy or “tomgirl” at heart, and I want to represent the part of me that always wished that I was born a boy so that I could play with dolls and wear dresses and subvert gender norms the way my brain has always wanted to. \n\nTyping this all out has reassured me that I really am legitimately some kind of trans person, and that I wish we had more non-toxic male icons in western culture. Also, it’s really hard for me to separate “I have a crush on this boy” from “I want to look like this boy.” But I’m getting there. \n\nThanks for reading and giving me some support and encouragement that I’m not making a huge mistake and that my guilt is wrong and shouldn’t stop me from living my most authentic life, even if it’s going to be more difficult.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Telling my parents I started T made me want to stop transitioning.', 'created': 1574335743.0}"

Until I started doing massage. I’ve been touched, asked to pick dick spots, grunted at sexually, boners galore, been physically hit after telling someone to keep their pants on... it just doesn’t make me feel safe. So I stopped doing massage except for ladies. It’s my own home and my own hands and a massage therapist is able to set rules about who they touch. Just like anyone in any scenario. You have the right to say no. 

However, before I did massage I wanted to be inclusive of everyone. I made clear treatment lists. It was listed by treatment not by men’s/women’s. Anyone could have a back wax if they wanted. Cismen come for other treatments and I feel totally safe. They are great people. Never push my boundaries. But as soon as massage is involved, the clientele that comes in takes a dark turn and are scary. The men that have other treatments have never booked massages and they are genuine, honest people that I’d be more than happy to do so. 

But how can I be inclusive when I get crude emails from cismen and transwomen. I have always stood up for everyone’s right to be and love who they want to be, on a personal level. But awful individuals always seem to use this as a way to assault me in my business. Eg ‘hello I am a trans woman and I want to come for a massage’ but with a crude email address or website or phone number that would lead me to believe that actually this is just someone with a creepy fetish of writing to salons in a vulgar way (come across it before in sales jobs, people just call to get off, very weird). 

Would you please share your experiences of salons with me? Is there anywhere that wowed you? Is there anything that would make you feel safer? 

As I know there are so many horror stories about ‘trans person goes to beauty salon, is turned away.’ The only time I would need to turn someone away is bikini waxing is very different on different genitals (I know genitals don’t matter it’s what is inside that counts, but they do if you don’t want to be bruised and have skin ripped off because the therapist isn’t trained in stretching correctly the area they are waxing). But because of my experiences with cismen, there is no way I want to train in ‘men’s intimate waxing.’ I can’t open my home to even more trouble. I am at my wits end. Constant panic attacks. 

I suppose what I’m trying to say is....is there a way I can be inclusive except to creepy old men 😆 because I think everyone should be able to come for a leg wax, pedicure, manicure, brow tidy, etc without feeling like they have to follow a men’s/women’s menu. 

If this was just a select few individuals I’ve had this problem with it wouldn’t bother me but because it is every single time a man is here for a massage, it is very very confusing and worrying. I don’t want to be sued for not being inclusive. But I also accept that I need to be educated on the proper way to do things.

He said it's an acronym for dressed as a girl. I didn't know that and I wouldn't have guessed it (what about drag kings?). Then he started to say it was stupid because sex has no predefined clothes and so on. I'm in a IT trade school. He didn't have any reasons to talk about that. I felt nauseous. I was playing Uno, but suddenly I couldn't make sense of my cards. I left the game. I notice my hands are shaking. My classmates talk to me but I can barely respond. My heart is racing. I'm sweating, getting paler and paler. I'm having a panic attack. Like the ones I used to have years ago, when I had social anxiety so severe I almost develop agarophobia. Before this I doubted if I actually was trans. Now I know for sure. I told my professor I had to go to the bathroom. I started crying. I look at the mirror and see I'm as pale as a dead body, my lips are dry and purple and my mascara is all over my face. They asked if I was okay, why I was taking so long. I said I was throwing up and they called my mom. Then I started writing this almost two hours ago. I had a talk with my professor, he thought I got nervous because of his class or maybe because I broke up with my BF or a family member died, etc. I said it was because what he said about gender triggered a panic attack. He started comparing gender to religion and he said society was forcing him to accept something he didn't believe in. I wasn't in the right mindset to explain anything, I just said he didn't know some things and it wasn't his fault, I know he didn't have bad intentions, and that I wasn't able to explain anything right now, as I was recovering.

Now I'm home. I'll have to process what happened today. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, I don't know what I'm going to tell him next week, I don't know a lot of things. English isn't my first language and I was feeling extremely bad when I wrote this, so I hope I expressed myself correctly. He probably thinks I'm a trans man, and I couldn't care less.

Then he started to say it was stupid because sex has no predefined clothes and so on. I'm in a IT trade school. He didn't have any reasons to talk about that. I felt nauseous. I was playing Uno, but suddenly I couldn't make sense of my cards. I left the game. I notice my hands are shaking. My classmates talk to me but I can barely respond. My heart is racing. I'm sweating, getting paler and paler. I'm having a panic attack. Like the ones I used to have years ago, when I had social anxiety so severe I almost develop agarophobia. Before this I doubted if I actually was trans. Now I know for sure. I told my professor I had to go to the bathroom. I started crying. I look at the mirror and see I'm as pale as a dead body, my lips are dry and purple and my mascara is all over my face. They asked if I was okay, why I was taking so long. I said I was throwing up and they called my mom. Then I started writing this almost two hours ago. I had a talk with my professor, he thought I got nervous because of his class or maybe because I broke up with my BF or a family member died, etc. I said it was because what he said about gender triggered a panic attack. He started comparing gender to religion and he said society was forcing him to accept something he didn't believe in. I wasn't in the right mindset to explain anything, I just said he didn't know some things and it wasn't his fault, I know he didn't have bad intentions, and that I wasn't able to explain anything right now, as I was recovering.\n\nNow I'm home. I'll have to process what happened today. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to post this, I don't know what I'm going to tell him next week, I don't know a lot of things. English isn't my first language and I was feeling extremely bad when I wrote this, so I hope I expressed myself correctly. He probably thinks I'm a trans man, and I couldn't care less.

1153,2019-11-21 20:05:47,dzp0n6,13,1,"Hi y'all. Just a throwaway account since the people I'm about to talk about know my main! 

I'm a 24 year old bi/pan Asian NB (they/them) and I've been relatively closeted my whole life, only a few close friends know I'm nonbinary or queer, most of my family sees me as a stereotypical straight male. I recently had an experience that made me really uncomfortable and still has me constantly examining my own perception of self, my own gender identity, because of how thoroughly it rattled me. I wanted to ask y'all for some perspective, maybe some advice, or to see if anyone else has experienced something similar.

A few weeks ago, I went to go visit my friend (22 NB lesbian) in their city, where they go to school. Earlier in the year, say, March/April, we had hooked up when I visited them then, and we hit it off really well, lot of flirting, chemistry, shared interests, etc. It wasn't long before I found myself catching feelings, and we sort of danced around the issue for a few more months; we had a couple of visits to each other's cities, going on sort-of dates, just in general being affectionate and intimate when possible. In August, I asked them over Discord if they were interested in dating, as we had been moving around the issue a fair bit - they had some residual relationship issues internally they wanted to settle before committing to an actual relationship, while I personally knew I had issues with my own past trauma regarding relationships, this had all been discussed on and off - but I had felt it was OK to move forwards with this. They expressed a bit of hesitation but said they were open to giving it a try, and I tabled the issue 'til I could see them IRL again, as I felt making decisions like committing to a relationship were best served for in-person, face to face conversation.

This time around, things were a little more tense. A combination of school stress - one of the main reasons I wasn't super gung-ho about chasing/pressing the issue was their massive academic load - and just general personal issues had them being more shy, less eager to be kissed and to be affectionate. Even so, I persevered (with consent), trying to make them feel at ease and comfortable as best as I could - something I would do for any of my friends feeling stressed and out of sorts. On the second day, I brought up the concept of exclusivity, asking if we were an item and if so, would they like to be monogamous? They seemed surprised at the question and turned it around, asking me if I wanted that. I replied in the affirmative and they said that they weren't seeing anyone else at the moment, to which I added (feeling like the moment was slipping away) that they could, if they wanted to. They replied that they might, in a very quiet tone of voice, and I was kinda hurt but I understood, y'know? Open relationships are a thing. If they weren't ready for a commitment, that's alright. 

A bit later, we had another conversation, where they admitted they didn't feel like they were in a place to actually date anyone, between academic work and just life stuff, they couldn't see themselves in a relationship. Some of the things that came up in the discussion were the concepts of anxious/avoidant relationship types, things like that, and just a general mutual consensus that, yes, we still enjoyed each other's company and we still liked each other and were attracted to each other, so I said, ""Guess we're just FWB then?"" And they nodded and held my hand, so I felt the issue was pretty settled. They did also say that I was being a little too forward when kissing them, so I made a mental note to chill on that front.

OK, wrapping things up, promise, the title part comes in here because I was really hurt at this point. Near the end of my visit, we were cuddling in bed and I started to make a move, just being affectionate in general - we had had a really lovely time out and I felt a good way to end our visit was with some intimacy. We fooled around for a bit, but after a while they said they weren't really feeling it. We got into another talk - they apologized deeply and said that they were attracted to women, and when I asked if they were attracted to me, they said they weren't sure. The conversation waxed and waned but the crux of it was that they respected my identity as a NB individual but felt that my body was too conventionally masculine/male for them to be attracted to - they added on that (I felt this was kinda hurtful but I see where they were coming from) if I were a female, they'd likely be a lot more receptive/respond more to my affection. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post - I wanted to provide as much context as possible for the story to show both sides as best as possible, just to cover as much as possible. I want to also add that I know people are allowed to be attracted to whatever they want to be, and that's on them, but it genuinely felt like, hurtful and transphobic? In a way, it felt like I was being reduced to my body and genitals - I present male for my work environment and family because I'm not out yet, and being told that, in some roundabout way, I wasn't feminine enough for them really cut me deeply. I'm still wrestling with the issues that bubbled up because of this. They're not a bad person, and we're still friends, but I'm just still really hurt. Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading! Stay fresh my nonbinary pals.

I live in Texas ,most people I talk to have never heard of/ doesn’t understand non binary.
So about 3 months ago I realized I was non binary. I came out to family and close friends relatively soon. I work at a very small office, around 40 people work there.We have a mens bathroom, a women’s bathroom, and then on the other side of the building (not much farther from the gendered bathrooms, but you do have to pass them to get there) is just a single bathroom with no gender on the door. This is the bathroom I feel most comfortable using. So, yesterday I was informed by another co worker that the people who sit across from the bathroom are accusing me of vaping in the bathroom. They said they can “hear me” vaping and can smell it. ( I do vape but I have never vaped in the bathroom at my job.) I told the co worker who relayed this information to me that if those people say anything again to her about to have them come talk directly to me so I can put a stop to this before something that isn’t even true possibly gets me in trouble. She said she would, so I moved on with my day and didn’t hear anything about it again. Until today. We had a meeting and in the meeting my boss brings up smoking and vaping and said nobody in the office should be smoking or vaping inside the office and specifically mentioned the bathrooms. This was obviously not a coincidence and was specifically directed at me. The people who started this lie are EXTREMELY close with my boss, work wise and friendship wise. I have talked to some co workers and their advice is  since those people that are accusing me of this are very close with my boss that I shouldn’t bring it up to my boss unless she addresses me about it first. 
If my boss does bring this up to me, I feel like there is going to be a question of why are you only using that bathroom. I know it’s not anyone’s business but I just need some advice of what to say if I do get put in this situation... do force myself I come out as non binary under these circumstances...?

She said she would, so I moved on with my day and didn’t hear anything about it again. Until today. We had a meeting and in the meeting my boss brings up smoking and vaping and said nobody in the office should be smoking or vaping inside the office and specifically mentioned the bathrooms. This was obviously not a coincidence and was specifically directed at me. The people who started this lie are EXTREMELY close with my boss, work wise and friendship wise. I have talked to some co workers and their advice is  since those people that are accusing me of this are very close with my boss that I shouldn’t bring it up to my boss unless she addresses me about it first. \nIf my boss does bring this up to me, I feel like there is going to be a question of why are you only using that bathroom. I know it’s not anyone’s business but I just need some advice of what to say if I do get put in this situation... do force myself I come out as non binary under these circumstances...?

I also wished I had thinner hips and shorter hair and because of all this and more I have reached the idea that I must be non-binary. \nAnd I think this is all well and done except our community is very small and not super well known and most people who do know about non-binary disagree with it and I get so much hatred online that while I feel so much more comfortable as non-binary I feel so much less comfortable in general when I apply it, if that makes sense. \nSo I've been over here wondering if it's worth pretending to be cis and ignore this side of me all because I cant handle the hatred."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Gender Confusion', 'created': 1574474372.0}"

I've been out as genderqueer for over a decade since I finally found a word for the kind of gnc I've been l o u d l y since I was a toddler. My mom just hasn't, uh, listened? She didn't know what it meant, so her brain never absorbed it. Honestly I don't tell her much, because she's exhausting. When I was coming out as queer in my early teens, she was BAD about that. She got better pretty quickly but never apologized.

My dad was okay. We were a lot alike and used to talk about everything. He died ten years ago. I'm not over it. I'm screwed up about it all the time. Whatever. 

So recently I changed my pronouns. I didn't change anything else. There is literally nothing new going on, just making other people actually respect my shit for once. And she's been a DISASTER. Just an endless selfish ignorant pain in my ass. Fine. She's always like that when she experiences even the slightest difficulty or confusion, hence why she's the last to know about the pronouns, which she's also mad about it. Whatever, I was SO calm and educational and careful with her, strung out response texts over a couple days to give her time to adjust every time, and she just kept ramping up the bullshit.

ANYWAY so she said an unforgivable thing, and it reminded me of a movie or book.

If I'm in a very LGBTQ+ oriented space, it's not so bad, because I know I don't have to educate anyone, but just out in the regular public? It's awful.

I look pretty androgynous and people regularly throw he or she at me depending on... Whatever they feel like, I guess.

Basically, I did my most public traditionally-feminine dress up ever at work (I am AMAB and mostly male-presenting), got lots of positive responses, and since then I’ve been wearing more make-up day-to-day out and about and at work, which makes me feel good.  I’ve continued to expand my wardrobe with more cute outfits, and it’s all got me feeling very validated and happy, even if I still question myself a lot and look for new and different ways to figure out how best to express my identity.  But, onto the good things...I wrote a note and posted it at my work thanking everyone for being so positive towards my changes, which received a lot of love.  

Then, a co-worker of mine approached me and told me that he read my letter and cried, because he is gender fluid, but are in a very non-supportive home, and told me I inspired him to start coming out.  Since then, he’s gotten a new name tag with his preferred name, came out some people, and I along with some (unfortunately not all, but a good portion) of our co-workers have been helping to affirm him as a first step in his identity.

But that’s not all!

I guess the point of this rant is, I know all too well how hard it is to put oneself out there in this way, and I never would have imagined how much I could help others just by being myself, and it makes me happy and excited to keep exploring myself going forward, knowing that other people in our community are becoming braver and happier seeing someone similar in our tiny, regressive town.

1260,2019-11-23 18:14:30,e0ln00,7,1,"TL;DR-I realized I’m not a binary trans man, struggling to find an identity that describes that I feel on the masculine side of the gender spectrum. Suggestions? I’m interested to know how people picked their labels.

AFAB, 28 here. I’ve been identifying as a binary trans dude since I started HRT in March. Lately I just felt like trying to pass as a cis dude was draining all of my energy and making me feel not like myself. I tend to be happiest when I’m nonconforming/femme in my presentation. I think it’s confusing because my dysphoria is very much a binary sex thing-I’m not happy with any part of my female anatomy. I don’t even want nipples because they remind me of reproduction and all that jazz. My physical transition goals are very geared towards having a male body (facial hair is looking great)! It’s hard to remember that sex and gender are different things, which is why I’ve been confused. 

Now I’m trying to figure out a good label for myself. I feel masculine side of neutral. I’m happy I was raised socialized as a girl. I feel so much more connected to my emotions, I don’t contribute to a culture of toxic masculinity. It’s pretty cool. I understand what women/trans fem people go through. I feel like defining myself as a binary trans “man” would be giving up that part of myself. 

I don’t think genderfluid is a good way to describe it because I don’t think my internal feelings about my gender identity shift from day to day. Maybe genderqueer is a good way of putting it. Transmasc feels like it conflates sex and gender identity. Just saying I’m non-binary to me doesn’t describe that I’m on the masculine side of the spectrum. What are y’all’s thoughts?

I had the thought that if ""they"" stand for two different things, 

- person who's gender is unknown or not relevant
- person who's gender is known to be nonbinary

there's a problem of mix ups when either people get offended because they assume they are thought to be nonbinary, or that nonbinary is seen less as a gender and somehow less permanent (yet to be decided; unknown) than he or she.

The more ""they"" comes to be cemented as *the* pronoun for nonbinary people, I was thinking that maybe there should be a new word for ""gender unknown for now or not relevant"". Like shey/shem?

I’m so tired. 

Where I am now, I’m getting happy with myself. I recognize myself. I’m learning to know and love myself. 

But I wish other people would learn to know me, too. 

My name is Malcolm Rowan (last name). I am 16 years old. A junior in high school. I enjoy reading, riding my bike and people watching. My favorite band is Glass Animals. My favorite movie is Grease. My favorite show is Jojo’s bizarre adventure. 

I am a nonbinary person. I prefer they/he pronouns. I’ve known since middle school. 

When I was younger, I could only see myself as disgusting and unlovable. I refused to look in the mirror or have pictures taken of me. I wore the same flannel for a year straight. I hated myself. I really, truly, in every sense of the word, hated myself. 

I thought I was fat, I tried to starve myself because I was so desperate to look different from the way I did. 

I know now that I was just uncomfortable with my chest and thighs, not my weight. 

Things got so bad I began to consider suicide. Luckily, I never got to the point I felt the need to actually do it, and I never will. 

That was years ago, things have changed for the better. The person I am now is someone younger me would’ve never dreamed of being. 

I got a binder, I wear masc clothes, I got a haircut, I met all of you wonderful people who I support and who support me. I can look in the mirror! And take pictures! I find myself attractive! 

I’m so, so happy. 

However, I’ll probably never fully come out. Only a few people I know in real life know, and I know a lot of people I consider my friends would not support me. My parents would not understand. My binder is hidden at home, along with my true self. 

I know I’m lucky, I’m extremely lucky. But every time I hear my dead name I feel like I’m rotting. Every time I get called a girl my head hurts. I can’t look at myself without my binder. I fully plan for top surgery when I’m older. I’ve cried over the way my hips look before. I want someone in my life to call me handsome, and mean it. I want to be taken seriously.

They seem to assume I’m a very masculine lesbian. \n\nNone of this bothers me except that we are getting married and at the wedding (and at any other family gatherings), there will be people who assume I’m a straight cis dude talking to people who assume I’m a very masculine lesbian.

Do I include my pronouns on the wedding invite? Do I do nothing and let people be confused?

Not only were they a gender rebel, but they also actively fought against facism.

TW: sexual assault

&amp;#x200B;

For as long as I can remember, I have been terrified of my father and men in general. He emotionally and physically abused me and my youngest sibling, but I always remember him being nicer to my middle sibling (I am the oldest.) I can't remember any of my childhood, especially around 7-9 years old. I thought this was because of my depression, which later got diagnosed as bipolar II. I started new medication and have started going to therapy, which has resulted in a lot of talking about my dad. For years (all through high school up until now at 23) I have felt like something traumatic happened to me besides the abuse. I just could not remember what exactly happened. I knew it was something sexual and something to do with my father. I just kept pushing it away because thats my dad, why would my dad do that? I have been having a lot of flashbacks of bits and pieces of memories of being abused. Last night, I kept having little flashbacks of times I was possibly sexually assaulted from random men grabbing me, to my ex coercing me to a friend in elementary school that made me watch porn with her and masturbate in front of her. Thats when the memory of my dad touching me came up. It was such a small memory, but it was so vivid. So vivid that I had nightmares all night and couldn't sleep much because closing my eyes scared me.

I feel like maybe it isn't true because I can't remember it all. I feel like my brain is just trying to hurt me. When I was 13 I reported my dad to my guidance counselor for touching my back and legs under my clothes and my whole family was insanely angry at me. I have no one else to talk to about this until I go to therapy next week, so i figured i would post here and maybe get some help. I don't know who to talk to, what to do or what to say.

I work in an Australian software company and unfortunately we need to ask people for their gender during the sign up process (sorry, can't go into the specifics for why we need this info). We currently allow users to select between Male, Female, and other. Our UK branch has come to us and said the word 'other' is offensive. Rather than taking cis people's word for that I figured it would be better to get the opinions of non-binary people. If people could answer the following questions I'd really appreciate it, especially if you're from the UK:

* Do you find the option of 'other' offensive?
* If you were building the drop down which options would you give?
* As opinion towards these matters differ in different cultures what country are you from?  

**Note:** I'm aware male and female are sex terminology but that's a whole other matter entirely.

1617,2019-11-28 20:23:40,e33p3e,3,1,"I thought I'd share this story here, for some background I'm AFAB and prefer they/them pronouns. 

On monday I had a performance review with my line manager who is also the centre manager where I work, these meetings are as much for me to talk about any concerns/needs as there are for my manager to evaluate my performance. The meeting went well, she was happy with my progress. Recently I had to pull out of some overtime for a couple of reasons, partly because I had more stuff on that weekend than I realised when I signed up for it and partly because my anxiety has been a little worse the last few weeks and I needed to not overwork myself. 

One of the reasons my anxiety has spiked is because getting incorrectly gendered all the time because I'm not out to many people is starting to really get to me, plus my family still using the wrong pronouns even though I'm out to them. I think they're trying and I know they do love me, but the fact that they never get them right makes it feel like they aren't trying because they don't care and I find it hard to correct them.

My manager was perfectly fine with me pulling out of the overtime and brought it up only to ask if I was doing okay, she knows that I've struggled with anxiety in the past and I have had to take time off work for it before (this was 4 weeks sick leave with full pay, I love my job) I said I was stressed about stuff going on in my personal life, she said she was there to support me with anything, not just work related things and if it was important to me it was important to her, she asked me if I had anyone else to talk to about it (which I don't)

I decided to tell her and I'm very glad I did, she told me that a friend of her son was trans (MtF) so she had come across it before, she had heard of nonbinary but said she didn't really know a lot about it. She asked me if i minded her doing her own research about it and said she wanted to look into how to best support me in the workplace.

It was a really positive experience and I'm really glad I did it. 

At this point I'm rambling a bit but I'm on a roll now, and I want to explain why I don't want to come out to my whole workplace.  I work at a salvation army homelessness hostel and I also go to the salvation army church in my area, because of the strong links between the two I can't come out at work without also coming out to my church. This is a shame really because I would feel fine coming out at work, we have a great team and while I'm sure none of them would know what non binary is, I'm sure they would all just go 'ok' and move on and not really treat me any differently. I also think the majority of my church would be the same, it's the minority who wouldn't. 

I do intend to come out at some point, I have a tentative plan to come out before pride 2020 so that I can go but I'm not sure yet. Sorry this got so long but I really wanted to get this off my chest.

The meeting went well, she was happy with my progress. Recently I had to pull out of some overtime for a couple of reasons, partly because I had more stuff on that weekend than I realised when I signed up for it and partly because my anxiety has been a little worse the last few weeks and I needed to not overwork myself. \n\nOne of the reasons my anxiety has spiked is because getting incorrectly gendered all the time because I'm not out to many people is starting to really get to me, plus my family still using the wrong pronouns even though I'm out to them. I think they're trying and I know they do love me, but the fact that they never get them right makes it feel like they aren't trying because they don't care and I find it hard to correct them.\n\nMy manager was perfectly fine with me pulling out of the overtime and brought it up only to ask if I was doing okay, she knows that I've struggled with anxiety in the past and I have had to take time off work for it before (this was 4 weeks sick leave with full pay, I love my job) I said I was stressed about stuff going on in my personal life, she said she was there to support me with anything, not just work related things and if it was important to me it was important to her, she asked me if I had anyone else to talk to about it (which I don't)\n\nI decided to tell her and I'm very glad I did, she told me that a friend of her son was trans (MtF) so she had come across it before, she had heard of nonbinary but said she didn't really know a lot about it.

Since I came out as gay 8 years ago, I've slowly found myself exploring my gender. Right away when I came out, I chopped my hair off. It felt like the most freeing thing I had ever done! 

Then I chucked most of my wardrobe - I had always felt deeply uncomfortable in the feminine clothes I owned, but I was too afraid to change bc I was worried I'd out myself to my family. I had never developed a personal style prior to coming out. Almost immediately I found myself drawn to a more androgynous presentation. At first, it was just little things: men's shoes, women's clothes with bits of menswear styling. Over the years that grew to include a preference for men's sweaters and shirts. Then last year, I bought a binder.

From the first time I wore it, I felt a huge change in myself - my confidence soared, the way I moved and carried myself changed. I looked in the mirror and suddenly all the things I didnt like about myself ""clicked"" and felt integrated, comfortable, and okay. 

It's not like I dislike my boobs or actively even think about them much? Yet when they are gone under a binder I just... feel better, more like me. When I picture myself aging, I picture myself looking like Tig Notaro I guess? Lol. I dunno if I'm making sense.

I still had (and have) ""feminine days"" where I enjoy rocking a dress and makeup. But somehow when I do it, it feels subversive, almost like a good joke that no one's in on, but me. It's fun.  But i spend the whole time hyperaware of my presentation; when I'm done, I'm DONE and have to get outta that dress ASAP or I totally crumble.

I don't feel that way when I'm presenting androgynously, especially when I bind. I feel like I sink into myself, like wrapping up in cozy blanket.

Lately I've been trying out different ways of dealing with my body hair, too. I'm blessed/cursed with extremely thick and dense hair. Awesome for my head! Not as awesome for my legs or underarms. Mostly because I've always hated shaving, but I also feel intensely uncomfortable keeping my legs and underarms natural. Recently I tried just using a good quality electric clipper to trim my leg hair to a short length without totally obliterating it. Turns out it felt SO RIGHT. Tidy and intentional and very me.

At first, these changes felt performative. Like I was testing out different ways of being perceived by others. Like i was testing out the different ways i would be treated by others. Nowadays, it feels more like I'm experiencing different ways of BEING. It's not as much about perception anymore. It's become about comfort.

There are some other areas that I feel like are complicating my thoughts on this. I was a tomboy growing up, and always fully resisted anything traditionally feminine. I was the kid who got physically uncomfortable in the ""pink"" aisle at the toy store. I also had a very traumatic childhood, mainly thanks to my mom. Am i just trying to distance myself from her? These feelings don't FEEL like a trauma (I have plenty of baggage, this doesn't feel like that) but its hard for me NOT to examine every feeling. Also, I was born without a uterus (though I have ovaries). I found out when I was 16. It didn't really bother me; every woman I knew was tearful and trying to console me about never having kids, but it legitimately felt like nothing for me. A non-issue.

I dont really mind being called a woman. I don't mind being called she/her. They/them sounds nice too. I definitely don't want to be called he/him. I guess I just feel like ""woman"" or ""she/her"" can't hold the entirety of me? Like it's one ingredient in my recipe but not the whole thing. I used to think I was proud of being a woman, but I'm starting to think lately I'm more proud of being SOCIALIZED as a woman and all that entails. When I think of what I'm actually proud of, its my empathy, kindness, strength, fierceness, and resilience. And how my shared experience and history with other women helped shape these things in me. 

I'll end with one random thought I had yesterday as I was singing along to Christmas music. My whole life, I've hated my voice, to the point of shame hearing a tape of myself (literally, I would hide in the bathroom when family tapes were played). It's deeper than the other women I know. 

Its most apparent in my comfortable singing range. Over the years, I trained myself to sing in higher registers even though it was a strain, bc every time I heard myself singing (not on tape, just in real time), i would find it so jarring it would disgust and unnerve me. Well, yesterday while driving I allowed myself to sing along in my normal range. And I actually LIKED how I sounded. And how I wished I could sing like that and have it feel consistent with my gender... like it wouldn't be a surprising voice to myself or to listeners. It's really hard to put into words, argh.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, this issue has been brewing for quite a while now. I've always been fairly feminine in how I wished to express myself (though expectations of masculinity definitely held me mostly inside the ""man box"", so to speak), and for as long as I remember I've wished that I had the bravery to adopt a more feminine appearance (holy fuck skirts and leggings and hairpins are rad as hell). A few nights ago, this kind of all hit me and I began to really ask myself, ""Am I NB?"" And now I can't stop thinking about how I would feel if I actually just abandoned the identity of ""man"" once and for all.  

&amp;#x200B;

And yet I'm worried about faking it, for attention or to feel special or whatever. Like, just because I don't want to be a man (or a woman) doesn't mean I'm NB, does it? Or is that what it means to be NB? When my girlfriend called me her ""boyfriend"" yesterday morning, and that felt uncomfortable (and then ""partner"" conversely felt way better), was that just because I wanted to be NB because I want to feel special? I don't have dysphoria (which I know not all trans/NB people have, I'm not a truscum), and I feel like I can make no claim to the oppression many members of this community face.

I’m nonbinary I guess and basically did a binary transition a number of years ago. Had some trans-related surgery more or less out of anxiety and that went horribly. Physical problems, pain, extremely ugly, etc. 

Stopped taking hormones because they have downsides for me and what’s the point now. Estranged from family but have no motivation to try to detransition even if it would help there. Just question why I have to be such a fuckup all the time.

Now just about everything is triggering, can’t get support from anywhere without running into transmisogyny, transphobia, terf shit, transmedicalism... racism, ableism, everything else, depending on what it is I’m not always the target but it’s still horrible and I can’t cope.

Other trans people are triggering because I feel like a mistake and because I don’t want to be rejected for provoking anxiety as a transition failure.

Basically after all this I’m more messed up and alone than ever and with these problems from surgery plus my neverending fatigue issues it’s just too much sometimes.

Etc.\n\nBasically after all this I’m more messed up and alone than ever and with these problems from surgery plus my neverending fatigue issues it’s just too much sometimes. But at the same time it literally doesn’t matter if anything is too much, because it doesn’t mean anything will change or “has to change” for the better. That has uhhhhh become crystal clear. So this is my life. \n\nSorry normally I wouldn’t come across as so bizarre and agitated, it’s just because of the anxiety attack. I truly don’t “need” support but it would be nice. Lol. Just please don’t expect me to respond. \n\nAnd I don’t really use Reddit so I’m not sure if it’s possible but please don’t PM me, I won’t read it.

SO, I started replying to the comments with an entire thesis’ worth of information. I’m a trans researcher, a legit subject matter expert on binding and tucking.

So when I talk about how 10-20 years ago there weren’t as many regulations or as much available research in doctors hands, so that’s why we hear about a few people put on medical tracks that ended in a transition they now regret; when I talk about HOW RARE THOSE CASES ARE; how drag is just a form of performance or dance, like ballet, jazz, or theatre; when I talk about how difficult it is for the youth I work with, who are 16-18 to get hormones, even WITH their parent’s support; when I talk about my expertise; when I mention that there are REAL threats to trans kids safety unrelated to medical transitioning (unsafe binding, stress, bullying, you idiots on the internet spreading false information); when I  s p e l l  it out for them... there are more people around the corner with the same dumb shit!

I’m not sure if this is a good place for this but I’m really just looking for advice. I have a younger brother. When he started 8th grade he began to start to become friends with a lot of LGBTQ+ artsy girls. He’s never been much into girls so I had suspected he might have been gay for awhile. A month or so ago he came out as Gender Non-binary and Pansexual. He wanted to use they/them pronouns and change his name (from a very gender neutral birth name) to Serge (after some YouTuber [?]). He dyed his hair black and got his ears pierced with studs. My parents don’t care how he wants to express himself but weren’t keen on the pronouns and name thing. More recently, he decided to come out again as Trans and change his pronouns to she/her and name to Sage.. He’s been having my mom buy him women’s clothing  (like jeans and hoodies, nothing too “girly”) recently but she still isn’t into the pronoun/name change. My Dad, on the other hand, thinks he doesn’t know what he is and just wants to fit in with his friends. As for me, I’m really just confused about what to think at all. I’m getting conflicting sides and angles from people and the internet. It’s very hard for me at the moment to change his pronouns/name because in my heart I know him as my brother and by his birth name. I know that some people don’t realize they are trans until later, but he was never one to wear girls clothing or want anything to do with “girly” things as a child. Obviously I know that not all girls are like that but It just makes it more confusing for me. This all started happening when he started hanging out with his new friends and I do wonder in the back of my mind if he is really just trying to fit in with them. He won’t talk to me (or any family for that matter) about it much. When I try to ask questions(politely) he just blows me off. He’s never been very nice to me but he’s gotten way more grouchy all the time nowadays. He stays at school late with his friends, comes home and hides in his room, and barely talks to me. When he does talk to me it’s normally yelling over absolutely nothing. I’ve heard stories of people being able to express their identities and immediately being happier but all this has seemed to do is make him more grumpy and irritable. I just need help knowing how I should proceed and what I should do? Should I try talking to him about it more? If so, how? I know it’s not my place to say how he feels, gender wise, but how do I know that he actually feels this way and isn’t just trying to get attention and fit in with his friends? How can he expect my parents and I to just accept that without being able to talk about it or ask questions? If this actually gets replies, please be nice and civil.

41,2019-11-01 19:16:06,dq8viw,0,1,"hey everyone! I’m Mars and I’m currently learning to accept and love myself. I just wanted to share something on here and see if anyone else has experienced this or something similar.

&amp;#x200B;

basically, I’m 18 years old and was assigned F at birth, my whole life I’ve been obnoxiously straight and femme, mostly because whenever I’d be more “myself” people would tease me and call me a dyke or other mean names. for example, I would dress up as the hulk and when my friends and family would say that I’m not a boy and I can’t be the hulk I would do a 180 and become obsessed with princesses.

&amp;#x200B;

 I’ve always wished that I could be a boy but didn’t really know what that meant, so at school when I was 6 I would feel out of place when put in the girls team or when using the girls bathroom. Even in my dreams, I was never a girl, I was always a boy. I would look at guys playing and wish I could be them. But I was taught that my desire to be them was just a crush. So for years I went on buying the frilliest things, hoping to please my mom or my friends. I remember the time that I was the most like myself I got called a boy and my friends’ reactions made me feel so guilty for being “misgendered”, even though I weirdly liked it. so after that I would try and try to fit this image of a girl. And at some points I liked it. I liked the idea of having a girly room and wardrobe, but even though I liked the idea, I didn’t identify with those things. 

&amp;#x200B;

So in 2015 ish I remember watching part of a movie that my mom was watching about a trans man, and I remember thinking “wow I’m glad I’m a woman, I’m so happy to be a woman, I wouldn’t be able to be happy if I was a man”, but as soon as I thought that I began picturing what it would be like if I was a man, and it just felt so natural. But I immediately told myself “nope, I would hate to be a boy” 

&amp;#x200B;

From 2015-2018 I didn’t really get a chance to explore my gender identity because I was battling a severe chronic illness and barely had the strength to keep up with school, and the times where I did feel dysphoria and felt like ripping off my boobs I wrote it off, because “I loved being a girl”.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, in the beginning of 2019 I started to accept myself as bisexual, which was already really difficult because I had already engrained this picture of myself as a cishet woman in my mind. And more recently, I’ve been feeling more and more dysphoria, and when it got to the point of me googling things like “why do I hate my boobs?”, “wanting to get rid of boobs”, “I hate being a woman”. And when all the results pointed towards trans websites and forums my immediate reaction was “oh ok, but I’m obviously not trans”, not for any particular reason but I just knew I wasn’t trans. I had planted my cisgenderness so far into my mind that it was like a law that I was trying to question. I felt so guilty and weird when I started thinking that I might be trans, because “I’m happy being a girl”, “look at my room, it’s girly”, “I love dresses”, “I’ve always been happy being a girl”. But it’s gotten to a point where I don’t think that’s enough of a reason to not be trans. I love pretty dresses, but I don’t want to wear them, cute pink girly rooms are aesthetically pleasing, but I don’t want one. And as dumb as it sounds it feels like I’m erasing an image I had created for myself. And that makes me feel like I’m faking this or it’s a phase. 

&amp;#x200B;

Deep down I’ve always known that I wasn’t a woman, so much so that I told myself from a young age that I wasn’t trans, I didn’t say that I am a woman, but I would just reassure myself that I am not trans and I was born a woman.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I’m sorry for this ridiculously long post, I guess this is just the first time I’m getting this all off my chest. I also considered that I could be non binary but that also doesn’t feel right. My biggest fear is just that I look at my past self covered in the girliest stuff and think, “what if I want be girly again? What if I miss it?” But I never liked it to begin with. I was just forcing myself to be someone I’m not and I’m slowly learning to allow myself to be me. And it’s really difficult.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this and feel free to tell me if I’m just going through a phase or if this sounds like what you experienced. I just wanted to share my pain, even if it’s online.

52,2019-11-01 23:44:13,dqch39,27,6,"Hello everyone, 

Cis male here with a question for the trans community. I have no trans friends to pose this question to and so I came here. I was recently permanently banned from the r/blackpeopletwitter subreddit for casually using the term “tranny” in a post because it was deemed an offensive slur. 

Full disclosure: the comment was a response to a word combination post regarding the “rapper” Drake. I said “drake is TRAsh and corNY... Tranny.” It can be seen here on another post I made about it in the r/banned subreddit: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/dpx7fe/have_said_and_been_called_the_n_word_multiple/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf


It was tasteless and was more a comment on my dislike of Drakes music and calling attention to the sort of pansexual air that he exudes, rather than aimed at the trans community, but I see how it could be taken as a dig at them. 

I’m old and admittedly ignorant, but when I was coming up, I always thought it was a shorthand for transvestites (crossdressers) only and not a term aimed at all groups that self identify as some sort of trans. And I never considered it might be a slur at all. 

So the question is, is it really a slur? Is this just cis activists being pissed off for a community that they aren’t even a part of? Google has conflicting answers. 

Downvotes are fine. I know this community is a place for everyone to come and not have to deal with cis ignorance, but I just really would like to know if my way of thinking on this is flawed and hurtful so I can correct it.

I was recently permanently banned from the r/blackpeopletwitter subreddit for casually using the term “tranny” in a post because it was deemed an offensive slur. \n\nFull disclosure: the comment was a response to a word combination post regarding the “rapper” Drake. I said “drake is TRAsh and corNY... Tranny.” It can be seen here on another post I made about it in the r/banned subreddit: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/banned/comments/dpx7fe/have_said_and_been_called_the_n_word_multiple/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nIt was tasteless and was more a comment on my dislike of Drakes music and calling attention to the sort of pansexual air that he exudes, rather than aimed at the trans community, but I see how it could be taken as a dig at them. \n\nI’m old and admittedly ignorant, but when I was coming up, I always thought it was a shorthand for transvestites (crossdressers) only and not a term aimed at all groups that self identify as some sort of trans. And I never considered it might be a slur at all. \n\nSo the question is, is it really a slur? Is this just cis activists being pissed off for a community that they aren’t even a part of? Google has conflicting answers. \n\nDownvotes are fine. I know this community is a place for everyone to come and not have to deal with cis ignorance, but I just really would like to know if my way of thinking on this is flawed and hurtful so I can correct it. \n\nThanks for your time and any responses', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Is “tranny” offensive?', 'created': 1572677053.0}"

I’m not a bad looking guy but I can never get with girls that are super attractive and alpha and that I’m super attracted to. The escort I just met for, wait for it.... 20 mins. Was so unbelievably beautiful. Most beautiful girl I’ve ever been with.. she was about 5’10. Brown skin. Smooth skin. Amazing lips and personality. Clearly intelligent. Amazing legs. She worked out obviously. Then her cock. As I was sucking it and she was moaning “yesss that’s it” and I felt her grow in my mouth and then my throat. It just kept growing in every direction. Before I knew it I was being throat fucked. I never thought I’d be able to do that but it was all the way in my throat and she was fucking me. She then lay down and I kept sucking her cock which was completely shaven. She looked incredible on the bed. Her hair was so soft and long. No surgery on her face totally natural but omg her lips. She smelled incredible. Her tits were amazinggggggg. The perfect size and so convincing. Her cock continued to get bigger and I continued to get throat fucked... honestly it was huge yet felt so amazing in my throat and she was loving it. Her moans and energy were incredible. She then asked “do you want me to fuck you”, when I said yes, she stood up, quickly squirted lube on her fingers, covered my ass hole with it and slid her she cock inside me. She fucked me really hard and fast and deep. She then put both feet on the bed and fucked me like a dog saying she was going to cum. She climaxed inside me, bareback, no condom, I felt her hot load inside me and I felt her huge cock throb inside me for about 20 seconds. She pulled out and cleaned herself while loads of hot creamy cum was pouring out of me as I finished myself off. Before she finished cleaning up I came and it shot so far it hit the back wall. I cleaned up, she let another client into the other room, then she showed me the door and I left. All in about 20 minutes. I can’t get over how beautiful she was. I feel like that is the only way I can be with girls that I’m super attracted to. I’ve been with 1 female escort before and it was horrible, she stank of shit and was clearly high.

I think I just need to get it off my chest, and when there's a 6 month waiting list for therapy, this is about as good as it gets for offloading the emotional baggage I suppose.

I don't know how so many of my brother's make this all seem so *easy*.. take, for example, my best friend. 28, been on T for 2 years, knows without a shred of doubt that he is a man.. always has been.. and you can kinda see it in his photos from life before his transition. He just did it, woke up one day and decided that was the day he was going to set his transition in motion and never looked back. He tells me all the time that I just need to be true to myself and forget what others think and while that is a beautiful notion in theory, it's just *NOT* that easy for me.

Say I did stop caring about what others think, great, I can just be true to me and not care about how that affects others around me... But that still requires me knowing who the &amp;@$# I am... It requires me being certain that *this* is who I am, that I am 100% sure that I am meant to transition. I don't know who I am. I don't *know* I'm a man, I'm 25 years old and until I was 23 I hadn't even *considered* the fact that something was different. I knew I was gay from the age of about 14 but trans? It hadn't ever crossed my mind.

Then factor in the thought of disappointing my parents.. forget everyone else, I don't care what anyone else thinks, but them? They're my life line.  Ever since I was little, I looked at my father and thought *""that, that is what a good man looks like""* I won't say I always wanted to be like him, cause I don't know that I did.. i remember when I was little I wanted to be a stay at home mom, have a husband just like my father and live a life that would make him proud. I wanted to do things he did, sure, but I don't think I ever really wanted to be a husband or anything when I was little.. I always dreamed of him walking me down the isle some day, having him bond with the person I'd marry.. and now, now that I've been questioning all of this gender stuff, I can't help but feel like I'd be robbing him of his little girl by transitioning.

I know I'm not who he dreamed I would be, none of us are really.. but the thought of disappointing him.. of making him mourn the little girl he spent so many nights rocking to sleep.. it breaks my heart. He's a good man. A great man. And I'd be lucky to be half the man he is.. but the thought of letting him down like that almost stops me in my tracks. 

My parents are old school, not rude, but not exactly progressive either.. they don't understand why so many people are coming out these days, and have openly admitted that they believe it's due to a millenial need to be a part of something special.. like by being trans, youth feel that they belong to a group or something. They basically support the notion that trenders are a very real thing and that lgbt awareness and involvement has become a social issue. That people are too quick to say I'm this or I'm that just to try and fit in.. and I can't blame them for the way they view the world, they were raised in a different time.. things have changed so much in their lifetime and accepting things they don't understand can be difficult. I get that. But it's also made it abundantly clear that they do not support the idea of people being openly trans. Which scares me. Because not only do I run the risk of making them mourn their daughter by transitioning but I also run the risk of them never truly accepting me as their son either.

I don't know if I'm trans or not, and maybe I'll never know for sure, but the thought of pushing them away.. the thought of losing the relationship we have.. it's terrifying. Even if I did know for sure.. I'm not sure I have it in me to transition and run the risk of losing them from my life. 

I just wish I could go back to being ignorant to the whole thing.. be blissfully unaware of any of it. I want this to all just go away.

 I really need an advice from all of you. Since I was a teenager, I always hated myself but I didn't know the reason why. All I knew was that every time I was dressing up with my friends to go out, I always envied them. They could wear bras, panties, really tight jeans and heels and I had to dress up like ""the normal guy"" society expects you to be (note that by that time I was heavily repressed to the point I would think that a guy doesn't have to dress up with clothes for ""girls"").

 Nowadays I'm 20 years old and discovered that I feel myself comfortable with being gender fluid, but I tend to express  more my female identity rather than the male one. 

Anyways, I have talked to my friends a lot, and I always tell them how if I were born with the female genitals, I would be the happiest woman alive, whereas I encounter myself right now scared the fuck out because I know I am transgender, I don't feel comfortable right now on my own skin, but I'm really scared of starting the hormone therapy and have the sex reassignment therapy done and say ""okay, this is not what I expected"" and end up hating myself even more for the rest of my life.

If this isnt allowed let me know, I tried looking at the rule.
I'm a transman and my school offers use of their gym for free to their students. I want to start lifting weights there, especially because I dont have funding or time to get a gym membership.
I have a huuuge chest though, though its just droopy and flat, theres a lot of movement.
I know I shouldnt wear a binder while exercising, but I'm not doing any cardio, just weights.
Would it be alright?
I know probably not but still tell me no if that's right
I just know other rules have changed, like you can swim in a gc2b now?
But then also if anyone has any advice for just keeping my moobs to my chest for anytime, but especially weight lifting, I would love that.
I can get away with wearing loose layers without binding but when they jump around when I walk at all, so if I can just like
(I would never but for example) tape them down so they dont move
That would really be good enough for me

I've had that experience, which my younger self would never believe, as I'd always wanted to have a full sex change for a long time.

When I was still in the womb, I was male, as they did a scan early on in my mum's pregnancy.  However, by the time I was born, I'd somehow physically changed during development and become female, and the doctors were astounded.  Despite the fact that I never knew this for a long time, I've always felt like a boy.  I never really enjoyed the same girl-oriented toys, products, etc that other girls did, and I hated how my mum dressed me up in frilly dresses.  Quite early on, I demanded to be able to choose my own clothes, and thankfully my mum didn't mind.  Never wore a skirt or dress again until I was way into adulthood.  I also asked for my hair to be cut really short.  People always said I was tomboyish, but that didn't sound right to me, as I genuinely just felt as though I was a boy naturally, not that I was just acting like one.  It got even more suggestive of that when I was 14, as by that point, I'd realised that I was attracted to girls.  By 15, I'd explored sexuality with girls and fully believed that I was a straight man, not a gay woman.  I hated puberty for making my female body unavoidable for me, and at that point, I decided I wanted to have a sex change as soon as I was old enough.

However, I had a lot of bad experiences between ages 16-19 that included abuse and rape by men, I'm sorry to say.  This kinda distracted me from my personal goals and things like that, and I just sort of coasted by for many years after that in a depression, knowing that I was old enough to do what I wanted now, but so depressed that I just didn't have the motivation to start such a large upheaval of my life.  I had a bad time for quite a while, but then, around age 24, I started to come out of it and feel better about things.  I'd also had a long break from sex with anyone, and had spent time getting to know myself properly and exploring the possibility of dressing in women's clothes and my adult feelings towards my birth gender, now that I had grown a lot from the child I was before.  Through having a good sexual experience with a man (for once) and finding that there were things about femininity that I did enjoy, I sort of realised that I'd come around to the idea of staying physically female and just enjoying gender exploration in my image and personality.

Nowadays, I don't really mind that I have a girl's body, as I've learnt that I can still feel comfortable with members of both sexes in the bedroom, and if anything, I enjoy playing with my image - I can be very boyish one day, ultra-girly the next, and somewhere in the androgynous middle another day.  It's quite fun.  I have to be honest, whenever I wear dresses and feminine clothing, I do feel like a man in drag, but I don't mind that, as dressing in drag can be fun, no?  I think I just became comfortable enough with myself as a person that I didn't care quite as much about what gender my body was.  If I had got a sex change, I don't think I'd regret it, but at the same time, I'm no longer pining to have one.  I think I'm just comfortable with things not being as I'd originally hoped for.

My wife and I are not intending to get pregnant in the near future, but she has talked about having baby names already picked out for our potential spawn. That's well and good for me as I don't have a strong take one way or the other, but my mild preference would be to give the potential offspring a gender-neutral name (example: Alex, Charlie, Cameron, Jordan, etc.).

That said, I know from my trans friend that realizing a name is an important part of the gender transition and I would be supportive of that as well. So I guess this is a general question that I did not want to post on r/askreddit, but if you had a gender-neutral name pre-transition, would you keep it post-transition? I also don't want to suggest that the name we assigned would be so important that it should never be changed.

So today the head of HR called me into his office and we discussed the roll-out plan as well as run everything they wanted to do past me to make sure I was comfortable with how they were proceeding. Frankly, I was blown away with the professionalism and sensitivity they showed me.

So the plan is that on Tuesday the CEO will release the new EO policy to the company then on Thursday they'll send out a company wide email announcing my transition (not an issue since everyone already knows by now and are all super awesome about it). Finally, around the new year they'll do some official training for the policy that the whole company will have to sign off on to confirm they took it.

371,2019-11-08 06:44:01,dtbjsa,6,1,"(I’m new to this subreddit btw)
I was really anxious but on Monday, I knew I had to be honest with my girlfriend. I told her I was transgender (male to female) and fortunately she was really accepting of me and doesn’t mind. Sadly though my family is not totally on board. I told my (unspecified parent) I was trans and they were really upset because I never showed any signs and I seemed like I wouldn’t ever have such feelings. The truth is that I come from a really religious and conservative family and they prefer the status quo most of the time, so I tried to suppress those feelings but it only worsened my depression. Fortunately when things were looking up, I’ve done a bit of self reflection every now and then and tried to be accepting toward myself and then I realized I was trans (I know it sounds very bland but I am really bad at explaining things I am sorry). They told me that this was a slap in the face to God on the gift that he gave me (my biological gender).That felt really hurtful and my parents are really stubborn about what they believe and this parent won’t even believe I am trans or wont acknowledge it, or give me any respect for it. I don’t think they are transphobic or dislike the LGBT community but a good amount of my family is religious (I’m a Christian but I’m not religious) and it is really scary that I hear some of them criticize the community and it has been really hurting me on the inside. I’ve had to always hide my feelings and i couldn’t ever truly express my gender identity unless it was online and it really hurts. I don’t know what I should do honestly, I don’t know if I should tell my family or wait for them to find out someday. I love my family but they are pretty stubborn on this type of topic so I couldn’t ever talk to them about it. Another problem is that I’ve been wanting to tell my therapist so she could help me through this but I’m not really sure.

I told her I was transgender (male to female) and fortunately she was really accepting of me and doesn’t mind. Sadly though my family is not totally on board. I told my (unspecified parent) I was trans and they were really upset because I never showed any signs and I seemed like I wouldn’t ever have such feelings. The truth is that I come from a really religious and conservative family and they prefer the status quo most of the time, so I tried to suppress those feelings but it only worsened my depression. Fortunately when things were looking up, I’ve done a bit of self reflection every now and then and tried to be accepting toward myself and then I realized I was trans (I know it sounds very bland but I am really bad at explaining things I am sorry). They told me that this was a slap in the face to God on the gift that he gave me (my biological gender).That felt really hurtful and my parents are really stubborn about what they believe and this parent won’t even believe I am trans or wont acknowledge it, or give me any respect for it. I don’t think they are transphobic or dislike the LGBT community but a good amount of my family is religious (I’m a Christian but I’m not religious) and it is really scary that I hear some of them criticize the community and it has been really hurting me on the inside. I’ve had to always hide my feelings and i couldn’t ever truly express my gender identity unless it was online and it really hurts. I don’t know what I should do honestly, I don’t know if I should tell my family or wait for them to find out someday. I love my family but they are pretty stubborn on this type of topic so I couldn’t ever talk to them about it. Another problem is that I’ve been wanting to tell my therapist so she could help me through this but I’m not really sure.\n\nI’m really sorry if this was painful to read or looks like it was rushed, I just tried to write out all my feelings I have held onto for the past year.

I told her I might be trans. She was surprised, I told her I was surprised too. She said whatever I do is fine. It went fine, overall, very chill. I just wish I could know for myself. On Monday, I was writing something for English where the main character was trans, and after the character had a bit of an emotional breakdown, I was just like ""wait that's just me isn't it."" So, I had a bit of a crisis as well. It went fine. I wrote some stuff about myself and how confused I am. For a bit I thought I was most likely a trans woman. Then I went through the rest of the week, thinking about it constantly. My reccomended was flooded with trans content, I found this subreddit, I considered the logistics of various things I hadn't thought of. It's been weird. From Tuesday to Thursday, while I was thinking about it a lot, I started thinking that I probably wasn't trans. And then, late last night, I realized there was a good chance I was an egg, and if I was, I was currently in the process of cracking. And I was convinced I did. I thought I had come to an at least mostly conclusive decision I was trans, and resolved to come out bu the end of today. And then, as the day passed, I wavered again. But, I consider myself to be on good terms with my past self, and if he really wanted this, and felt he needed to tell our parents how he was feeling, I wasn't going to change my mind. So I came out, it was very casual, I was trying to be a little goofy about it, to show I'm not too distraught or that they need to worry themselves too much over this. And yeah. Now it's now.

So that's what happened over my week, I guess this next part is going to more of my internal thoughts and musings.

So, I've thought about this more lightly before this Monday, and the conclusion I came to when I did was that I don't really have a naturally strong sense of gender identity, so I just latched myself onto what was easiest and I was most used to, my biological sex. And I was happy with this conclusion for a while. Then, the English assignment came along. I didn't write a trans character because I was feeling this way, I started writing it, which got me thinking about this more and more. She was a trans girl in the 1910s (Didn't want to do historical fiction, but that was the assignment.) I knew it would be hard, I knew that I a cis boy, couldn't really understand the experiences and feelings of a trans girl. But, knowing I had thought about this and had questions about it, thought I could just have her sort of think about the same things I did, and have the same kinds of questions, and everything would be the same up until she concluded she's a girl where I concluded I was a boy. You know what they say, if you don't know how to write a character, just make them an exact copy of yourself.  There was something I noticed here. Why was it easier for me to write a trans girl than a trans boy? You'd think, identifying as male, I could just write someone like me, who was born with a vagina. My brother pointed this out too, and all I could think of was ""yeah that is weird."" This was when things really kicked off. I've thought about if I would like to be a girl. And the answer is... kind of? I think it could be nice, honestly. It would just kind of feel nice to slip into she/her pronouns, and feminine clothing, and boobs. But on the other hand, I don't really have any problems with my current gender. I'm alright, i consider myself a visually decent young man. I come on here and I see people who are moving past the life that was expected of them, showing and being proud of their true self. And I'm so happy for them, I really am. But I don't resent my current pronouns, or name, or penis. But I think it could be really nice to grow up and mature into a lovely young lady. And on the third hand, *it's so hard.* transitioning is not easy. Explaining it to people can be uncomfortable, medically transitioning comes with puberty 2, and sometimes painful surgery, if that's what you want to do, and I have *no pain tolerance.* And no matter what you do, you are always gonna get shit for it. And I don't really want to have to deal with all that, I just want to sit around at home and play kingdom hearts. I don't get the feeling other people get of being trapped in their own skin, or only ever feeling that they could have been the way they are. I'm just kind of, to put it lightly, envious of lady-skin. But I also like my skin. All skin is good. And on the fourth hand, if you think about it, what even really is my problem? I'm not trans enough? I'm too okay with my assigned gender? I'm not dysphoric enough? The more I think about it, the more my problem seems like a bullshit non-problem and I'm just complaining about nothing while real trans people are out there suffering real problems, so I just get mad at myself for feeling this way. And on the fifth hand, I get mad at myself for feeling that way because invalidating myself and my problems is not right and just makes me feel worse, and I shouldn't feel like I'm not allowed to feel like this just because others have it worse. And on the sixth hand, I might be able to completely resolve this whole thing by forgoing the gender binary and identifying as genderfluid, or agender, or bigender, but despite not really identifying strongly with either of the binary genders, I don't really identify with any of the non-binary genders. I don't want to invent my own new custom gender, cause that would just be a train wreck. My gender is a paradox, defined as the state of wanting to be both male and female, but not bigender, wanting to not have to deal with gender at all, but not agender, and having constantly shifting views of my own gender, but not genderfluid.

So basically at this point I'm a hindu goddess of indesiciveness, self contradiction, confusion, being a gender whore, and being completely fucking done with the entire concept of gender.

I read these stories every day all over the internet. Someone is at two months, four months, or even six months of HRT. They are looking in the mirror feeling discouraged. Dysphoria has done a number once again. I know for myself that, at the start of month four, I am examining myself one, two, three times a day in the mirror. I am combing my face for that new curve or measuring my boobs with my hands looking for that slight addition of mass that may have magically shown up while I was scripting at my desk all morning(after all boobs grow best with PowerShell). I have been caught in many an awkward position in the restroom at work, peering at my facial hair. In response, I have learned the art of quickly pretending to pop a zit or something.

Here is the deal. We all know this takes a while. We all have taken turns reading accounts of the significant changes accumulating around the 16 months to 2 yr marks. The problem is that we have seen enough of the “look what happened after just three months of HRT” posts to hope we are going to be those lucky few. I for one, don’t give up that hope. Let's face it, though; we aren’t helping our dysphoria issues any.

So what is an ambitious transitioning person like myself to do? After all, we put our whole lives on hold to transition. So shouldn’t it be right that we want to see results right away? Therein lies the problem. Transition is designed to enrich our lives, not to pause it. The medical transition could take up to five years if done without surgical alteration.

# The truth is we need to continue to live and let the magic happen in the background.

Why? Isn’t the point that we want to live as our genuine gender identities? YES....but…..in the meantime…..

***Explore Your New Mental Capacities***

Fact! Estrogen and Testosterone considerably change the chemical makeup of your brain and your perception of the day to day life around you. These changes happen early, so learn to take time out of each day to reflect. People often do not do this anymore because of the draw of Facebook and video games and just the hectic scheduled the modern working-class endure. I work 9 hr shifts with 3 hours of commuting. I have found that I can turn those 3 hours of torture in my car into a time to discover myself. 

Before I started HRT, I had never written anything outside of school. I hated the concept of grammar; I hated editing. I never felt I had anything to say. Now I find release in front of Microsoft Word. Sounds crazy, but to me, it's worth more than the boobs. Most of what I write never gets published. It's for me, and my release. Every once in a while, something like this does surface that I do feel comfortable publishing; It brings me great satisfaction to share my thoughts and experiences with others.

Other people find that they are musicians, or artists, or enjoy crafts and scrapbooking. Do what you discover that comes to you, experiment, you may love the results, and if you don’t, it was still worth the exploration. Trans Men and Non-Binary on Testosterone will often find that they have a new depth for logic and focused thought. Before I started Estrogen, I would spend hours inside my head, thinking about all the problems in the world and how I could solve them. I never answered the world's questions, but maybe you will. Afterall your take on life and past experiences give you a unique perspective on the condition of the world and society.

**Change the things you can control**

People often wait until after their body has changed to look at things like their weight and their voice, their mannerisms, etc. Right now is a great time to start. It's especially important to realize once you start changing, it might happen quicker than you anticipated and while your body is ready to come out, the rest of you isn’t. IF and only if you are unhappy with any of these things about yourself, this is an excellent time for self-improvement. I am choosing to work on all these things. I started at 420lbs, and now I am somewhere in the middle of the 200s. In my personal goals, I have a long way to go until I am comfortable. So instead of obsessing over my face, I can run or hit the gym.

**EVERYONE's TRANSITION IS DIFFERENT.**

There is no set weight, appearance, voice type, etc. Everyone has their own goals. I am saying use this time to figure out what they are, what needs to change, and how to change them. Then get busy. Maybe you want to be a better activist or more vocal about the rights of your community. Great. Start reading, attend meetings, learn about the politics of your region…whatever it is, step away from the mirror.

Medical transition is magical! There is no doubt about that, but it's slow, and it's frustrating. Dysphoria hates the waiting. Your life does not need to revolve around that process, find something meaningful and do it. The time will pass quickly and it will be rewarding the less time you obsess over your cup size today.",trans,"So, You are transitioning -- Don’t Forget To Live You Life!",1573351056.0,"{'created_utc': 1573325856, 'id': 'du02pk', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""  \n\nI read these stories every day all over the internet.

451,2019-11-09 21:43:31,du27z5,1,1,"Rant. Let's go.

Comfort appreciated but not necessary. I just need to get this out.

I'm transgender (*ftm*) and bisexual (*considering pan but.... you'll see.*) I was talking to my mom about my best friend's girlfriend, who is bisexual. My mom says, and I quote:

""I wonder, in 10 years, how many of you will still identify as bisexual. It's just experimentation.""

...*what*????

She went on a rant on how ""Your generation feels the need to put a title on it. I don't want you coming out because then you'll have a new title. And what if it's just a phase? You can't erase that from your life.""

While I have had a rough journey in my sexuality through the past couple years, my mom has been there to support me. Now, when I came out as trans, she's started to slip, and fall into denial.

""You're *not* depressed.""

""You don't *need* your meds""

""**This whole trans thing** ***doesn't*** **seem like** ***you***.""

I'm getting off course.

My mom starts with ""Back in my day...""

So. Yeah.

""There was only straight and gay. Bi didn't exist. It was experimentation. And it was frowned upon.

I was going to the parade as a way to thank local veterans but I also thought I might try and register some voters there or get them to register to vote by mail (Florida). Never hurts to ask people if they are up to date on their registration. No sooner than I had started to set up, two women came up to me and my friend and asked us if we were registered to vote. They had the same idea as us but they were already canvassing the crowd.

Immediately, I recognized one woman as being trans. Now I don't have any issues with being out but I know that other trans people aren't so comfortable being clocked. So I didn't say anything directly to her about it. She looked fabulous too, cis people aren't going to clock her (I know for a fact that my friend did not) but my transponder is unfortunately quite good. She even had a hat on that was the colors of the trans flag that said something about mermaids. I complimented it, she only said, ""Thanks"". 

I mentioned the groups I'm involved with, including the LGBTQ+ caucus and I also had my bracelet on which is in trans colors and says ""Trans Pride"" on it. (I got this at the Trans Visibility March on Washington, I think it's pretty cool.) No reaction from her and I wasn't about to out her. 

It is so incredibly rare to meet trans people who are working on anything political, at least where I live.

But on the rare occasions that I do run into other trans people, it's the same problem.

I really want to make connections within our community and when I meet another trans person, and it is pretty rare for this to happen outside of support groups, I instantly want to talk to them.

476,2019-11-10 05:18:58,du7c9k,0,1,"Hello!

My boyfriend (it’s complicated, but we were dating and are only taking a break due to mental health reasons) is trans and is going through a lot of tough things right now.

Most of it has to do with sex. Apparently he forced himself to like it due to it triggering extreme dysphoria for him to do sexual things. It also has to do with this kid who’s sexually harassed/assaulted him very recently, as he’s having trouble even showering due to the mental distress it’s caused him, and since he hates looking at himself even more.

I was wondering if there is anything I could do to help him. I’m not sure that there is, since this isn’t in my control, but I want to know if there‘s anything I can to do ease his mind, even if it’s only a bit.

Unfortunately, I don’t get to see him often due to us living in different towns and neither of us being able to drive.

Thank you for reading, and any and all advice would be appreciated.",trans,Couple’s Advice?,1573388338.0,"{'created_utc': 1573363138, 'id': 'du7c9k', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello!\n\nMy boyfriend (it’s complicated, but we were dating and are only taking a break due to mental health reasons) is trans and is going through a lot of tough things right now.\n\nMost of it has to do with sex.

This was about 4 months ago but the truth came out a couple of days ago.

Classic how he went through the cycle of being an asshole to me, then being almost flirtatiously sweet to me then when things didnt go his way with my young friend who is polyamorous and he hates me again and my friendship with this girl is his excuse to hate me again. It's a fucking transphobic front and I'm making sure that most of my coworkers know about his shit.
He was a real motherfucker to my friend and accused her of trying to fake when she was raped, insinuating that she had sex with him consenting and she was just trying to fuck her attacker over unfairly supposedly. I told her that shit today. I told a few people how he tried to hook up with a trans girl who used to work there before. At the end of the day he ran me though all these transphobic and misogynistic games and I want him to burn for it. I almost never wanted to see someone burn so bad! I'm angry for all of us and this is bigger than me because he is fucking transphobic misogynist pos. He needs to suffer because he wont change and his only chance is his life needs to be destroyed and fuck him anyways. He used me and put me in this position where he thought he could fuck me but if he had to he could just lie and say he was manipulating me to fuck my friend.. both are pretty shiteating things for a person to do. Either way I feel used.

I got some really bad dysphoria when I found out that the trans girl he tried to hook up with passed among the crew and ppl clocked me on day one because of my voice if not my appearance.(this came out in the discussion which revealed my coworker being a cowardly transphobic shit talker behind my back) I went through a day of dysphoric depression over this shit and finally put it away, just feeling vindicated that the owner of the pizza place i work at told me that basically fuck him, we put out a job ad and when we get a pizza cook he's fucking burnt crust.

They encouraged me to basically fuck him over and leave early without telling him when we were scheduled to close together, probably the coolest thing I've ever had a business owner tell me to do.

Something seems off though. I wonder if this will flip to me just looking crazy and petty even though I'm not.. I wonder but I'm not worried..
But what really bothers me is how dysphoria seems to hit in waves.
As I worked by him tonight the sense that he is entitled just was making me mad. I slammed my locker shut after being the ice queen to him all day. He worked at his best behavior all night so I know he thinks something is up. I really feel he deserves it and i want to see him burn. On the other hand i have this second wave of dysphoria hitting me. He seemed unfazed by my icey behavior to him and it just was like further blows to me. Like wtf you are so fucking entitled that I'm not passing and that I'm just a faggot to you? Like I dont deservebthe same opportunities and I deserve to be isolated because I'm an ugly old tranny.....? I feel so fucking shitty even thinking about it.

Ugh! It makes me even more mad that he would keep this secret that he tried to hook up with this passing privileged girl who behaves like a fucking drag queen but I get clocked because I smoke a lot of weed and listen to trap and metal and I've been in fights, or maybe I'm just fucking ugly. Wtf is up with societies standard of passing? Am I just not feminine enough or am I just fucking ugly af or something...? Ugh!!!! Now I'm just drinking alone and I'm pissed and drunk! My girlfriend was being a little bitchy earlier which doesn't help. I just feel so fucked up and weak sometimes really.

(Another Disclaimer: I refer to my crush as he/him in this whole post because he has not told me otherwise, despite my suspicions. I do not mean any disrespect.)

Hey, so I need some advice from those of you who are more knowledgable in this situation. 

I have a crush on this person, he has presented himself as a guy, goes by a male name, and has a low voice and a biologically male body... he came out to me as bisexual, and spends a lot of time in the LGBTQ center at our university. We have been in a bunch of classes together, and recently caught feelings for each other, and confessed them. 

He is a very reserved person and has only opened up to me in a very personal way very recently. 

He knows I am very religious, and that I have no experience with LGBTQ culture, given my upraising. I have also recently asked some taboo questions about one of his exes, a trans masculine, not knowing what I'm doing. He got defensive. 

Today he said that there is something he's not telling me about himself that he thinks will weird me out. I think I know what it is. Maybe I'm reading too much into everything, but he told me recently how he likes wearing skirts, and I noticed that he shaves his arms and has grown his head hair out really long and sometimes wears pretty clips in it. I hope I am not doing something wrong by wondering if these are signs he is actually trans feminine. This would also fit some things he has said. 

I am not pushing him to tell me, but told him that I am more understanding than he thinks, and that I would like to get to know him better, as well as saying that nothing he could tell me about himself would change my opinion of him. He hasn't texted me back after I said all of this. 

I just want to know, is there something I can do to make him feel more comfortable to tell me (if he wants to) whatever his secret is, whether he comes out to me as trans or otherwise?

I am starting to try and educate myself on trans culture, both for my betterment as a person and so I can connect with him if this is his secret.

Like a few week ago I was CERTAIN I was trans, I even told some of my friends, but now it's like wtf why on earth would you tell people that when you aren't even sure yourself. Of course it isn't on purpose but my friend is basically making me feel like I'm faking it all or something.

 I don't really think I felt like this before a year or so ago whereas my friend said she just knew her whole life. Like even that just makes me think like wow so my feelings can't be real? I'm pretty sure I didn't feel this way until sometime after she came out to me, so part of me thinks I'm just doing it to 'follow a trend' or something fml. Her therepist once asked her 'what do you think makes a person trans?' and she said gender dysphoria. Well, idk if I have that. I don't think I do I really dunno. So her saying that is a straight punch to the guts coz then wtf does that make me. n obviously none of this was said to hurt me but it makes me really confused n I just dunno what to do. It's like her being 'successfully' trans makes me feel like shit. Coz pre-everything, she's a super cute super feminine person, like of anybody in the world has a chance at passing it's her believe me. But I'm here with a deep af voice, tall as shit, ugly as shit n I'm like why even worry about this when you know a transition would be shit for you anyway.

The entire situation really confuses me. I feel like 2 different people a lot honestly.
Like the person who came out to friends, the person who wore makeup to a club really doesn't feel like me. I'm not saying that as in oh I regret doing that, I mean literally it's like who tf was that n why would they say those untrue things?

The thing is, I've been thinking I'm trans, but I feel like I'm ""not dysphoric enough"" to be trans. I see many other people talking about how they knew they were trans when they were younger, or how they've always been uncomfortable in their body, but I've only felt (or at least, noticed) it myself for a few months.

For a few days now (maybe a week) I've been trying to express myself as I want to more, as I feel I've always had what I want to say a bit bottled up as it's ""not a boy thing to do"" (like calling things cute, acting how I want to, etc), but everytime I do, I may feel happy for a moment, but then just feel like some dumb boy acting weird. :(
After thinking about this, I realized that there are actually quite a few things I like doing or having that I never show or tell anyone brcause it's ""not something a boy would do"" (like, stuffed animals, pins or decorations, clothes, etc)

How do I tell if I'm doubting myself or not actually ""trans enough""? Again, I really am sorry if this offends anyone. Any advice/or help is very appriciated! (Btw, I don't think I can really go to a gender therapist right now, as I haven't come out yet

But then I realized I was trans, and that the darkness wasn’t faceless at all. In fact, it had my face – my real face. 


I was fighting myself.


When I turned to look at the people behind me, all I saw were monsters - People who I called family and friends and neighbors moments ago became ruthless enemies determined to kill me, as if I had discovered a dark secret of the realm.


Slowly I came to realize the narrative of my story. Now that the antagonist is defined, the truth comes out… the awful, horrific, real-life truth comes out…


I can never win. I can only fight.

My estradiol was down at 33 pg/dL and my testosterone was at 200 ng/dL  


That basically means that my estrogen was in male range and my testosterone was climbing back up to male range.   


It was horrible and I was terrified the HRT wasn't working anymore.  I started to smell a little different, hair was growing in thicker and it was harder to get a clean shave and I was getting more uncomfortable and longer lasting erections.  I thought that it was so many different things.   


I knew smoking / vaping was bad but I didn't know that it not only substantially decreased the efficacy of estradiol but it then did something to actually turn the excess estrogen into testosterone!    


So when I got that test I quit smoking and vaping (at that point it was mostly vaping but I had been smoking for a few months before hand). A month from then I recently got a new test and my testosterone was: 16 ng/dL   
and my estrogen is up at 93 pg/DL  


Nicotine withdrawals plus a complete shift in hormones hasn't been the easiest thing but it was so worth it. If you take sublingual estrogen and you smoke you may be making it really hard for your hormones to do what they need to!    
I'm sure plenty of people have already figured it out.. But maybe there is one person who is facing this same problem. I believe in you!

Hello all, 

I don't know where to start.
At this point I honestly hate being trans. And I don't know how to handle it. I can't seem to get over the fact that I'll never be a ""real"" woman, that I'll never be able to give birth to a child and to never get a period. I don't know what ive done to come here but it seems that I am faking everything at this point. I'm pre everything and definitely not passing as woman/girl. And it hurts. Real bad. All these thoughts and ""facts"" made me think and now I honestly hate being trans. But it's not like I can quit because I want to be a woman, I don't want to be whatever I am at this moment. I am getting professional help hopefully soon, but I just wanted to know if you have some helpful advice for me. 

I am really sorry if this message made you feel bad about yourself, but I don't know what to do at this point. Again, I'm sorry.

I've been questioning my gender since I was around 14 and you can probably tell by the title it's not an easy time, like for most people. Especially because I live in a more conservative area with some pretty intolerant people in my group of friends. 

It's only been in the past few months where I've proper opened up about being possibly trans, my closest friends call me a feminine name which I like (for anonymity reasons we'll just say Alex for feminine and Kyle for masculine) and I've even had my college name tag changed but I feel its a big step too fast but it's nice. My closest friends are really accepting and we kinda treat it like I am 100% trans which I'm fine with but they do know u still feel odd about it. My best friend had said ""but you are a woman"" to something I said and that really got to me in a positive way. 

I do tend to use feminine deodorant and shower gel but I do prefer baths because I can shave my legs, been doing that since about 15-ish? Speaking of which I do shave my arms to and I'm not going to in to more detail about what I do shave. I do also feel a bit weird about my body, not sure if that's just image issues or dysphoria but I would like my hips to be a bit wider and my shoulders to be less wide. 

There's times where I feel a lot more confident about it like I remember telling my closest friend how I felt about 92%-ish and a couple days later I was completely unsure about myself again. Not sure if that's hinting towards gender fluidity or what but I feel it would be a bit of an ask to have people call me 2 names depending on the day, especially since a few of my friends thinks being gender fluid is made up but then again I'm not especially close with them. 

I get really self conscious as well about how other people find out and transition. Like I hear how people know from dy one, they never acted like the gender they were assigned at birth, and when i hear that I just think these people are so confident in how they feel and I'm just a mess with it all and it's a big hit on the confidence you know?

Okay, so, I'm an 18 year old FtM trans guy, I've been on hormones for three months today. The other day, I got the amazing news that I could be eligible for top surgery before I'm even 19. I was ecstatic, since my chest is where most of my dysphoria comes from. I was so excited, I got to looking at surgeons and what I need to get started.

Here's where my problem lies. I'm scared. Not scared that I'll regret it, or scared that I won't like the outcome. I know it's permanent,and I'm perfectly fine with all of those factors. But I think I'm scared that going into top surgery after only being on T for three months is too hasty.

however, i have two more very close friends who i can’t seem to bring myself to come out to.

one of them is a ftm who’s publicly trans and presents male all the time. he used to arguably be my best friend around 4 years ago, and now we go to different schools, but we still talk from time to time and i trust him a lot.

my other friend is a girl who’s at my school and we have a lot in common. we aren’t exactly best friends (like we don’t really “hang out”) but she’s super easy to talk to and i definitely know her better than most. she’s also been vocally supportive of lgbt+ rights and equality in the past. the friend who i’ve already come out to told me that he’s pretty sure (around 70% sure, he said) that this girl’s older sister is trans (who’s quite a bit older and is well out of college by now).

i guess i’m just afraid to bring it up because it’s clearly a sensitive area for both of them and compared to what they’ve both been through i’m worried i’d come across as fake. if i’m being honest i think that’s the only reason i’m not out to either of them yet.

at this point though, these people are probably my two greatest potential allies and i really can’t afford to stall forever. i’ve mentally formulated a bit of a plan in order to impose deadlines to pressure myself (otherwise i’d just sit in the closet forever), and that plan has me coming out to my parents in March, which means i’m hoping to be out to at least 6 (or so) friends by then.

811,2019-11-16 07:03:47,dx3mb0,5,1,"Just sharing some nice news from this week!

So my classmate and I have spent a lot of this semester together. We have known each other 3 years, since freshman year of college, and I've known her as a male this whole time. She's pre-op, though she naturally has some feminine features. Since we're in two classes together, we see each other Monday-Thursday, walking from class to class together, and study together on the weekends for hours. Catching feelings was bound to happen, and so it did. 

About a week ago, my crush texted me, saying ""I like you, but if you knew more about me, you'd be weirded out."" I assured her that even if I was weirded out, I would figure it out, and would ultimately be understanding. She was concerned about telling me, since I am very religious and highly uneducated about trans culture, and had made a faux pa  the week previous when discussing her trans ex. 

After she said she was worried I'd be weirded out, I put together a lot of pieces of the puzzle and hypothesized that she was trans. There were a number of signs, in things she said and did. Guessing this and feeling convicted in my faith for not trying to understand a group of people different than me, I went to her the next day and said, ""I'm uneducated in trans culture. Can you point me in the direction of where to start learning?"" She was surprised and happy, I think. 

In a statistically unlikely turn of events, the same day I said this to my crush, a COMPLETELY UNRELATED friend, who doesn't know her at all, and knew nothing about my new initiative, came out to me as transfeminine. It blew my mind, how bold she was and how unexpected the event was. I told my crush about it, and she felt that I reacted in a good way. That day she texted and said ""Idk if you're up for more surprises, but I want to tell you something."" I was so overwhelmed with all the new information, both my friend coming out and the trans research I was doing, that I asked if we could talk the next day. She said maybe. 

The next day comes, and she's clearly nervous, and keeps putting off talking to me. I straight up say ""I think I know what you're gonna say, and I hope you know it won't change how I feel about you"". But she's still nervous. There's this tension throughout dinner, then after as we're studying, and because I'm a straightforward type person, I say ""Look, I think we both know what you're too nervous to say, but I wish we could just talk about it since this is clearly more important than this homework."" She was still reluctant, but finally, she pulled out her phone and texted it to me, even though I was right there. 
""Alright, I'll say it. I'm trans.""

Of course I hugged her, and thanked her for coming out. It was so nice to finally have everything out in the open, and now we're continuing our flirtationship with a better understanding of each other. I think she's adorable, and love who she is. She and I have different values and goals, so we're not planning on dating, just flirting a bit and enjoying each other. I am really happy that she felt comfortable coming out to me, even though she is still being reserved about things involving her gender identity, like how she is avoiding showing me what she looks like when she dresses like a woman. She still lives with her conservative parents, and they don't know, so she has a secret instagram account where she puts pictures. I'd like to see, but I don't want to push it. 

So that's how everything stands so far!

Dear Colleagues;

I wish to inform you of an important change in my personal and professional life.  It is important that you hear these changes directly from me, as I value and greatly respect you and our professional relationship.

844,2019-11-17 01:56:28,dxgdnx,2,1," Starting off, I'm a 20M Asian gay guy who I can self-describe myself as softly effeminate, reserved and soft-spoken. Recently, I've been having growing feelings of the desire for people, mainly guys, to treat me as a straight female. The best I could explain it is with how some women wanting to be treated by their male friends like fellow 'bros' or 'homies', it's a reverse sentiment for myself, wanting my male friends and also guys in general to see me as a woman.

As a guy, I never hold many traits that I could consider masculine (never associating myself with bromance) and I feel more comfortable being in touch with traits considered feminine. For one, I crave deep-rooted intimacy with my male friends (unlike most guys) and am extremely affectionate with guys in general (when receptive or asked). I'm very open-minded when it comes to any intimacy... putting my head on a guy's chest, playing with his chest hair and listening to his heartbeat and deep breathing, being kissed on my forehead from time to time, sitting on a guy's lap to holding hands whether we're just friends or much more.

I feel like I want to be nurturing, supportive... loving. I just don't feel appreciated as a male to be in that role and I feel if I was a female, I would be treated differently and the fact is, I want to. My guy friends wouldn't have to be so emotionally distant, and I feel like they would do better in opening up to me through our friendships if that was the case. I desire guys whom I can completely trust without hesitation and be nurturing to them, to make them feel all gooey on the inside. In return, the safety, feeling of being protected and I matter to a guy is something I deeply crave.

On the sexual side of things, I find that if a guy wanted to make me or treat me as a woman, and if he would ask if it's alright if he made me wear some lingerie to make me feel feminine, exposed, make me more beautiful... I'd would like that very much. I've started to nurture my female persona by giving it a name... Cassie. I would gradually become more self-aware in my mannerisms, subtly changing them to be more feminine (e.g. waving my hands more when I'm explaining things, sitting in lady-like positions with knees closed and ankles crossed)

Most nights, I would read cheesy erotic fiction/romance stories where I would imagine myself more and more in the character of being feminine, trans/cross-dressers, wanting to escape in the fantasy of being a loving gf, and a wife... with a manly husband I'd want to wash over me with his tide of testosterone but holding a gentle and caring heart to take care of me and nurture me too. Sometimes, I would cry myself to sleep hoping it would be true in my life.

Growing up in a conservative household, my parents haven't been the most emotionally nurturing or supporting parents. In the past, my relationship between them has been heavily strained and to this day, I still don't trust them or haven't completely forgiven them for the past hurt they've placed on me. I don't think I ever will. It's not something I like to talk about in great detail.

I feel like my male friends wouldn't understand or be open-minded to what I'm feeling right now, and all I want is for a guy who can do so and won't reserve no judgment, but I want to take a step and trust at least one. I'm getting in touch with one of my guy friends soon and thinking it would be best to come out to him but I don't know how would I express it, I don't think I'm even trans enough but I would like it if people would refer to me with female pronouns and calling me by my female name, even if it meant I'm not strictly going through MtF, SRS or HRT any time soon. If it gets to that stage, then it shall be but for now, I want to take baby steps and be comfortable where I want to be.

849,2019-11-17 04:23:26,dxi0sn,5,1,"Over the years, I've seen a trend in the world of aesthetics. One that's too big to ignore. I would go on instagram, a platform of looks, and see one thing.

Hordes of Insta models that were popping off with one thing in common : FAT ASSES

Every insta girl left and right was getting their butt done. I then realized that the greatest looks-maxxing procedure for a woman was the Brazilian Butt Lift

However, when it comes to the trans community, no one talks about it. BBL (Brazilian Butt lift) is a fat transfer procedure where they transfer the fat in your body to your butt and hips.

I hypothesized that this would be the procedure that could give an MTF the proportions of a women, being that it is a fat transfer surgery that can be done multiple times. After some research, I found that most instagram models and strippers were going to surgeons overseas to get their BBL's done for reasons such as:

\- Its much cheaper

\- they are more aggressive with liposuction and surgery - hence better results

I saw box shaped bodies with a pudgy, disgusting, waist and a flat butt turn to hourglass bodies with a tight fit waist and big round bubble butt. A real womans body.

The results from BBL's are insane.

Ex 1: [http://prntscr.com/py0acr](http://prntscr.com/py0acr)

Ex 2: [http://prntscr.com/py0fl1](http://prntscr.com/py0fl1)

With the BBL, it is now possible for MTF's to achieve the body similar to Kim Kardashian or perhaps an instagram model. As social media dictates, being slim thick is the wave.

Now , I personally will be getting this surgery done multiple times and I recommend that you do too.

I've been thinking, and reflecting, and reading stuff online for a while, and have come to the conclusion that I may be trans? But I'm not sure, and while I know it's something I'll have to think on for a bit and find out on my own, I'd love to hear anyone's thoughts on here.

To start, I'm female, biologically. But as a kid when I played games for pretend, I was always a male lion or horse or whatever. When I write characters to write books, it's always from a male POV. I relate to male characters better, and have more male friends. I enjoy being in a group of guys and just being considered one of them, rather than being ""the girl"". Even better if someone actually mistakes me for a guy, that's very exciting. In high school, for whatever reason, a classmate threatened to call me by a guy's name and I just said ""okay"" and was secretly so thrilled that he *did*, for the next two years. I always dream from the POV of a guy (like it's him, but it's me, and it's entirely interchangeable). When I worked at a place where there was a guy's uniform and a girl's uniform, I badgered the manager into letting me wear the guy's, for no other reason than that I wanted to (they looked nearly identical, I was pretty much the only one who would notice that I wore the guy's at all). I tend to think of my clothing and shoe size in mens', and then switch to womens' when I need to. About five years ago I cut my hair really short (but not as short as I wanted, because my parents wouldn't let me) and straight up said I wanted a boy haircut (I've since let it grow back out because curly hair at an awkward mid length tends to be bad. Someday I do want to get that really short boy cut though...). I've even imagined having male anatomy at times.

SO. All that, and yet I'm not particularly dysphoric. I mean I know I said I've imagined having male anatomy, and I would really like to try a binder, but I'm also not like super upset at having female anatomy. And I know the discourse on dysphoria can get really nasty. I don't want to encroach on spaces that aren't mind. I'm worried that maybe everything I've said can be explained away by where and how I grew up and how society has conditioned me, or something. Any thoughts at all would be fabulous.

My friend talked to me about and we’re both not really sure on how to help — other than telling them that they are a wonderful person and that their feelings and thoughts are valid and awesome and that they are effing brave (i use “they“ for now, cause the kid is still using their birthname and is maybe more at a point of finding comfort away from being “she/her” rather than being ready to embrace the “he/him” pronouns).
What info, tipps, knowledge, support etc can he provide to them?

I have been reading a bunch of stuff on reddit about different trans issues and I have some questions why do some trans people (apparently I haven't seen it myself) not disclose they are trans I don't understand all the emotions behind it as I don't feel emotions for some reason but if people get killed over this and just being trans in General why not just disclose it some people hate trans people and a lot of people don't at the same time 

This is how I look at it in my head if I go out to dinner and  I order chicken I expect to get chicken not fish with chicken seasoning I have no problem with fish I just don't want it I want chicken wouldn't you be upset if you got meat as a vegan and they tried to say it was not meat but plants and then when you dindt want it they called you meatphobic and whatever else this is just an analogy I use in my head to help me understand 

I just think there are a lot of men that are into trans people why not just be with the people who are cool with you why would any trans person try to date straight person if that person is straight the want the opposite sex and that's okay it's unfair to them if you lie about the sex you were born as  you probably believe that you are whatever sex you transitioned to and that's your right to feel that way I don't try to say anything different but they may not believe that you are the sex you transitioned to to them it's just a dude in make-up or wherever they may believe and that's also their right just because you want something doesn't mean you can lie to get it  if you have transitioned that is great and I'm very happy for you but please if you're trying to date straight  people just let them know about it you have nothing to be ashamed of it's their loss if they aren't cool with it I'm just saying if some one believes you are the gender you were born as then to them if they are that same gender they are now gay if they are attracted to you or sleep with you they aren't really but to them it's just as real as you being born in the wrong body so it probably makes them feel dirty or something like that and if they feel that way then to them it's true even if it's not so put yourself in there shoes and think about how you would feel if you had something like that happen to you

I havent seen her for 2 months at this point, and I have gotten really comfortable with my gender identity with her gone. I think I might have subconsciously supressed being trans when I had her in my life. My one guess is becoming female I might have more in common with her.

We’ve been together for 3 years now, and although I cannot predict the future I am nearly certain that she is the person I will marry. 
I have been in a number of longterm relationships in the past, and through those I have learned what sort of person makes for the best partner.
We get along well. We moved into our first apartment about 3 months ago, faced a number of challenges together, and have come out all the better.

In november of last year I mentioned my feelings of dysphoria to her for the first and last time. It was a very difficult conversation that ended with both of us in tears. I find it difficult to look back on, and we both haven’t mentioned it since. I recognize that this is unhealthy. We have however grown so much as a couple since then.
A transphobe she is not. I respect that she is a heterosexual, and nothing I can do will change that. 
..
She looks forward to our future as much as I do. We are happy and healthy despite the challenges we are facing transitioning into adulthood. I am a recent college graduate, and she is currently in her junior year of university. We both work and find time to invest in our hobbies.

I couldn’t be more fortunate.

This is a fact that I have weighed against my future with my partner. 

Transitioning would threaten everything I hold dear in life.

in october 2019, i was prepping for name changes at my work place. i've been socially transitioned for a while now, my testosterone date is fast approaching on november 26th. as my coworkers transitioned my name, my employers got wind of it and shortly after, i was terminated with no reason why or anything. i was kicked from the work chat, the schedule, etc and was never told a single thing. now, where i live there are ***no*** laws protecting the LGBT as a whole in the workplace, and it is a right to work state. they are legally able to fire me over it. 

we traced everything, and come to find out someone had mentioned that i'm trans the same day i was fired. it's hard to be stealth when you're pre-hormones but can usually pass as your should've been gender. 

today, i got a job offer from my university after an interview that took place on the 15th. one of my close friends got me the interview and brought up the situation beforehand.   
upon me accepting the request, current staff was talked to and was told there would be no tolerating any harassment or mistreatment towards me because of my gender identity. 

so, do not give up hope on workplaces. if you're struggling with it or have gotten fired like i have, have no fears, because there is a much better workplace waiting for you to merge into.

946,2019-11-18 23:50:51,dybw2p,6,1,"So this is a very specific topic for this subreddit and I don't mean to take the spotlight for it but, this thought has been plaguing me for weeks now.

I like making movies and in the past month I've been developing a story about a trans character. I don't want to give away too much but I wanted to hear from you guys because I want to make sure this doesn't suck. I'm non binary myself so this is kinda my view point although most of the character's traits are really my interpretation of them since, as I said, this is a movie and doesn't have to represent anyone's life.

This is all gonna be in fantasy land and with stop motion puppets. The premise is that this trans character is a nomad and lives off of stealing food from rich markets and just lives in the woods (one of the main influences was Diogenes). The whole movie is just different random scenes. They wear both female and male clothes (this is how it's shown that they are trans). Then sometimes they get super drunk off of stolen wine. At the end they are brutally killed by two rich kids while the main character is wearing a woman's dress.

I mean it sounds kinda tame like this, but I don't want a trans person to see this and think that I'm representing them as lazy and thieves. Also they would think what good does it do if the main character is just killed off like that, is that my fate too? Or something like that. I mean my intent is to just show the depression related to it all and some happiness that comes from defying society (stealing) and at then end just have villains kill the character off because they are seen as ""different"", which is definitely not a far fetched situation in the past (or today) for a trans person.

So my issue is, I like this story but I keep imagining ways for someone to get mad at me because, mainly, I have to put my name on it you know? I mean if it were up to me I wouldn't really care but I'm gonna be trying to show this to people for a while and also the process of making it takes a lot of time that I don't want to see go to waste.",trans,"Is my movie about trans issues ""too much""?",1574146251.0,"{'created_utc': 1574121051, 'id': 'dybw2p', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'So this is a very specific topic for this subreddit and I don\'t mean to take the spotlight for it but, this thought has been plaguing me for weeks now.\n\nI like making movies and in the past month I\'ve been developing a story about a trans character.

Okay, I’ll explain why I’m mad. Well, more upset then mad. I fully understand that it takes time for parents to understand if their child wants to be called by their preferred name, wants to be referred to by son or daughter instead of what they were called before, etc. That shit takes time. But... it’s been six months, and she still misgenders me. 

I’m called ‘my little girl’ by my mum, she still calls me pretty even though I always politely remind her I’d like to be called ‘handsome’, as it helps keep my dysphoria away. 

I’ve asked if she can look into starting me on testosterone, and she makes up excuses despite the fact my therapist has done research on this shit, and told her...

She won’t even get me a binder, and she never uses my preferred name. It... it hurts a lot. Yknow? That she’s not even making an effort. It was so hard to come out to her, and it seems like I haven’t gotten anywhere... she’s also made it quite clear she doesn’t like the name I chose for myself. 

I don’t really have a father figure in my life unless you count my abusive step dad, I’ve kind of lost all of my friends to more popular kids, and my brothers are both completely out of my life. 

I have some online friends, but even I barely talk with them. All of this has pounced up on me and increased my eating disorders ten fold, and my life has gotten to the point where it’s not even worth it anymore. 

Wake up, and do nothing but things I hate. I have nothing to look forward to. Wake up, school, work or musical theatre or therapy, home, sleep, repeat. Musical theatre used to be fun, it’s not anymore. 

We’re supposed to be moving soon, and I’m just hoping my mum will finally remember long enough to put my name as my preferred name on the new attendance.

I'm technically trans, but I can’t transition mostly because of the societal issues and money and fear of my future health (family has a lot of cancer and I’m afraid hormone therapy would increase my already high likelihood of cancer). 

I really didn’t think female technicians were still uncommon these days, but I’ve learned it still is where I’m from. I go into peoples houses alone to fix whatever needs repair, and every day, sometimes more than once a day, I get locked into a conversation that usually starts like, “I didn’t expect a woman! Wow! I’m so surprised. Good job! It’s good to see women doing these things. Women can do what men can do too! Girl power!” 

I’ve had this job for nearly 10 years, and the occurrence and frequency of these conversations have not stopped. So when people constantly point out I’m a woman and say “Wow congrats” it’s extremely hard to not want to flat out tell them to drop it.

People say it so much that I just go, “Oh yeah, haha, everyone says that,” Then I'm surprised that they're surprised that they’re not the first one to notice. I used to be really good at putting on a performance and really engaging in these conversations, but now I'm at the end of my rope. I can only really reply with one to two word sentences and forced smiles. People keep going on about it regardless, it's like I have no hope.

I realize this doesn't seem like a big issue. All my friends shrug when I complain. It reminds me of when a friend who delivered pizzas would complain about how people who would see him carrying a pizza would have a list of annoying reoccurring phrases they’d say almost like they were NPCs, like “Oh hey is that for me?” or something. So I realize this problem doesn’t seem like a problem except for those who experience it, so all I can really say is imagine your job, but every day, you’re distracted from your work to have the same conversation about something about yourself you hate. And then you’re congratulated for it. How the fuck do I manage this? Even just opinions on it, negative or positive, or maybe tell me I’m complaining over nothing. Since I’m the only person I know with this annoying problem it would really help just to get out of my own echo chamber of a head.

So I realize this problem doesn’t seem like a problem except for those who experience it, so all I can really say is imagine your job, but every day, you’re distracted from your work to have the same conversation about something about yourself you hate. And then you’re congratulated for it. How the fuck do I manage this? Even just opinions on it, negative or positive, or maybe tell me I’m complaining over nothing. Since I’m the only person I know with this annoying problem it would really help just to get out of my own echo chamber of a head.\n\nThanks for reading. \n\nTL;DR: I'm trans and hate being a woman, but people at my job always talk about me being a woman and I'm about to explode."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Need advice, I am still biologically female, but I am internally male.

August 2015... What a time... I was only a half year past suddenly losing my father, and a couple of months later, my paternal grandfather. As you can see, I was able to steal a moment or two of happiness amidst the noise, but my soul ached. This too is abundantly clear on my face.
-
I struggled with identity... I'm a generation left hanging by a thread. At this point, to think I was anything other than his proud son? No! *I* was meant to carry on the name of my father and his father... Whoof... You could never have convinced me otherwise. (Julia, don't you have a brother? Shut up ok? I always had to solve things... Yeah, fine! He can claim some family-name torch-bearing BS too!)
-
So many people ask me why I got married if I ""always knew I was trans"" and well... It's complicated. She was everything to me... Helped me through some tough moments, and I lived some of my happiest moments, up until that point, with her... So I proposed! Then my father died... I knew that I wanted someone in my life who could care for another human like she cared for me through that grief. So I continued to work out what I thought was the only cause of suffering in my life. I wanted to follow through. My dad knew we were getting married, so I charged forth with purpose!
-
Before my father passed, I had just begun seeking counseling for... something... I wouldn't know until years later what, but at the point pictured on the left, I only had room enough to process my intense grief.
-
It wouldn't be until a few years later that gender dysphoria began to surface (for the last time). Grief was manageable, but I was still broken somehow. How could I be? I was HAPPY damnit! I'm married. I made everyone proud! I have a good job. I did the life thing, and it's going well! Right?

Any way near the end of the 3rd movie, Naked Gun Three and a Third, their is a very annoying transgender joke. The beautiful super sluty girl thats the main bad guys girlfriend finally comes around to falling for the good guy.  So she takes off all her clothes and then boom you see a shadow of a penis.

They then proceeds to sleep with everyone they can to get ahead and kill Dan Elway.  This all ended with the big reveal that they still have their manly bits and their tucked in the weirdest way ive ever heard of. 

Any body else know any other movies out their that make fun of are use transgender persons as the butt of these jokes.

At the end of my last therapy session, my therapist suggested I attempt to look into self compassion. As I did, I realized that fighting this feeling that I’ve been battling this inner knowledge for as far as I can remember being nearly +28 years. A few close friends have relatives that are transitioning, that started to put cracks in this wall that I had built up against this knowledge that I have tried to ignore for far too long.
 Nov 3rd, I came out to my ex-fiance (relationship ended over a decade ago), she was truly accepting and is one of my biggest supporters, a week later I came out to my roommate/chosen sister, she was just was accepting and my biggest supporter. Earlier this week my sister gave me her waist cincher, I thought I was on cloud 9 at that time and have been glowing since. My sister told her husband the following day that I came out to her, he is truly like a brother to me, he is just as supportive and accepting. He would have a happy sister than a miserable brother.
Nearly half a lifetime ago I talked to my mom about these feelings that I had, she was accepting then, today, I reiterated my future plan(4-6 years) to transition into the female that I should’ve born into, she is just as accepting now as she was then, she has a few concerns as any mother truly does. 
As I got back home this evening, my sis gave me a bag of clothes that she had set aside to donate to the women’s shelter and allowed me to pick through and set aside anything that I want to wear in the mean time. Pants, shirts, 2 dresses! She has plans to make a few gaffes for me and our close friend that are transitioning, this is where Cloud 9 is, I forgot what happiness was and what it had felt like.
As someone in their early 30’s, I am completely astonishingly astounded with how much support and acceptance that I have received, I never thought I would be able to do this and that I would have to fight to choke these feelings down for the rest of my life.

And so pretty much for a while ive been going as Charlie online. When I'm filling out forms, I'll sign as Charlie, not Chloe. Ive always (since i was 13) seen myself as a nonbinary person named charlie who uses they/them pronouns (once im in college and away from this transphobic town)

However every now and then for the past few months, ive just been chilling and all of a sudden find myself in a state of an almost out of body experience where I can see myself from a 3rd person perspective, but as a man. Ive always loved it when people mitake me for a guy (shoutout to that old drunk guy who said i look like leonardo dicaprio). 

Last night, i got real high and realized(?) discovered (?) come to the conclusion (?) that I also kind of identify with the male gender (which sucks since im 90% misandrist)

1086,2019-11-21 09:14:20,dzgp1r,6,1,"Just thought I'd make a post about my thoughts on this. While I'm aware this might not change a lot of minds I think someone should call out this stuff. I've seen quite a few comments saying things along the lines of xy chromosomes make someone a man no matter what. Well then I'd have to ask why do xy chromosomes make someone a man? If there's no reasoning, then as far as I'm concerned it's just an opinion. If there is reasoning then this is where I see the contradiction. The only good reasoning one can give as to why xy chromosomes are considered ""male"" dna is because most people who have them have typical male characteristics(gonads, internal and external reproductive organs, secondary sex characteristics, and hormones). Excluding chromosomes and gonads trans women can shift all aforementioned characteristics towards that of a typical woman and remove the gonads they were born with. The process currently isn't perfect but at the end of it their bodies are undenyable shifted towards that of most cis women and away from most cis men. Evidence shows trans people have brains like that of the gender they identify as. On top of this there are women born physically female but possessing xy chromosomes. The point is you can't logically consider chromosomes an important sex trait without also accepting other traits are important as well. Even if one shifts the argument to say that all said traits are important but chromosomes are most important I would have to ask why again. The line of reasoning most critics might give is that chromosomes are obviously genetic and genetics are at the base of biology.

Sex chromosomes just usually cause the body to follow one of the two sets of dna. The idea of sex chromosomes as a ""genetic switch"" has been accepted for quite a while but seems to be ignored when it comes to trans people. The whole reason  hormone therapy succeeds at changing the body is because trans women actually do have female genetics.

While I\'m aware this might not change a lot of minds I think someone should call out this stuff. I\'ve seen quite a few comments saying things along the lines of xy chromosomes make someone a man no matter what. Well then I\'d have to ask why do xy chromosomes make someone a man? If there\'s no reasoning, then as far as I\'m concerned it\'s just an opinion. If there is reasoning then this is where I see the contradiction. The only good reasoning one can give as to why xy chromosomes are considered ""male"" dna is because most people who have them have typical male characteristics(gonads, internal and external reproductive organs, secondary sex characteristics, and hormones). Excluding chromosomes and gonads trans women can shift all aforementioned characteristics towards that of a typical woman and remove the gonads they were born with. The process currently isn\'t perfect but at the end of it their bodies are undenyable shifted towards that of most cis women and away from most cis men. Evidence shows trans people have brains like that of the gender they identify as. On top of this there are women born physically female but possessing xy chromosomes. The point is you can\'t logically consider chromosomes an important sex trait without also accepting other traits are important as well.

I am MtF 5 months HRT but I cam out as trans years ago. This opportunity seemed to good to be true they were living in an area I wanted to move to eventually anyways and they extended the offer to my partner as well. I honestly thought things were looking up for once in my life. Lets just say the last however many years haven't been exactly kind to me, and the last six months have been a complete trip and the most positive in my life thanks to my partner, who came into my life around that time.   


So I moved. To somewhere that the only friends I had I was living with, I still have no job yet and going home is...touchy subject.   


So I have been here about a month. I was finally in a trans positive household for once or so I thought. It was only two weeks before the phrase. "" You will never bleed like I do"" was said to me. It's now been multiple times that the same two people I saw as friends have now on multiple occasions tried to manipulate me against my partner. I probably wouldn't have identified this had it not been for the fact this isn't the first time I've dealt with highly manipulative people. Them trying to tell me my partner, who is trans as well, and is the last human being to ever try to gatekeep or tell people how their experiences are, was gatekeeping my new roommates period and was telling my roommate how they experience life for them. As well as I was being told my partner was insulting them for being cis. Literally this is nothing that has happened or ever would happen. It's not that I trust my partner too much. Its that literally what she was accused of is the opposite of her personal philosophies. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I tried to keep peace that night while my roommate blew up at everyone in the room and made a mess of things until I was scared to open my mouth to speak at all. Out of fear of both fear of my words being turned and warped like my partners were or literally fear of something  being thrown at me.

   
To avoid conflict. I have avoided all confrontation like the plague........until 3 days ago. All four of us went to an event. When we got back. That same roommate started confrontation and I don't know what came over me but I fell right into it as well. Regrettably I lost my temper and raised my voice. That was the extent of my aggression before I was able to walk away and unfortunately my partner and her got into it. Nothing physical but I could hear, it their voices arguing. Eventually. It stopped.  My partner came to our room, and we were quiet the rest of the night.   


Slight context five of us live in this house. Myself and my partner, we aren't on the lease. My two former friends, one of which is the house owner and the other who is his partner(the one whom most conflict has been with).  The fifth is the house owners daughter. Also MtF. All of us are 18+  


So my partner and I stayed in our room. 6 hours later. I can still here that roommate screaming at her partner. Slamming things around, Acting as though this only happened because all of us are still male and still have to act like we have dominance. Proclaiming multiple times that she is the only ""real woman"" in the house. More of are yelling and ranting included things that seem incredibly unstable.   


Frankly put I haven't left my room for the last three days while the sun is up. I can't just move out and go home. I don't have somewhere to go. Even if my partners family took us in temporarily. What would that show her parents. She's only in this situation as well because of me. Us coming back and needing to stay with them would reflect poorly on all of us and put a mass amount of tension on her and her parents relationship. As well It took weeks for her job transfer to go through and it just did. So she isn't eligible for a new transfer back for potentially months.   
On top of things I'm finally in a city where there is a pretty positive LGBT community and we can present openly in public without fear. I just have no friends here.   


I know its a long post but I don't know what to do. I feel like this is all my fault. My roommates weren't like this before. As well as long as I avoided confrontation. Everything was fine. I'm the one who suggested we take the offer to move because I trusted the people and I regret it now. I wish I would have just stayed living in my apartment I had before.

1178,2019-11-22 23:56:30,e09q80,5,1,"Hello all,

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this sort of question. If not, apologies, I'm having a hard time figuring out the role of each one of the trans-related subreddits.

Cis pan female ally here. A few years ago, my (also cis) boyfriend's friend and co-worker (in their late 30s), who had identified as a cis gay man until then, started realizing they might be trans. Over the next months/years, she started HRT, got top surgery, went through all the hoops that the government was requesting to change her name and gender on all her ID and papers, and finally got bottom surgery last month.

We were there for her the whole time, supporting her every step of the way. I went shopping with her for feminine clothes and makeup for the first time, I helped her with general makeup/hair/clothing tips, and she seemed to be feeling better and better as her transition advanced, except those days when the hormones really messed with her emotional state. We supported her through her breakup—her boyfriend remains a very close friend, but in the end, he's gay and attracted to men, so the romantic side of their relationship kind of came undone. More recently, we visited her almost every day after she got her reassignment surgery. It was a rough business, she went through so much pain, and she seemed to be reacting way worse than the other patients there (the nurses said so and it was also quite apparent).

Only a week after the whole ordeal, she was already walking back on her decision. Her therapist told her it was a normal process and lots of trans people have a period of regret after the surgery, but eventually this feeling subsides. Myself, I had never heard of this phenomenon, but I trusted what the therapist said and told my friend to bide her time. After all, she had taken YEARS to transition to living full time as a woman. What was a few more weeks? But she was adamant, to the point that she told her therapist she would stop seeing them unless they told her what she wanted to hear and supported her in her decision to de-transition. Eventually she did stop seeing the therapist, I guess she wasn't being told what she wanted to hear.

When I asked her what motivated her decision, she said it had nothing to do with her identity. She still felt them same. But she said she hated the way she was being treated as a trans woman, and had a much better quality of life when she lived as a gay man, and so she just wanted that quality of life back. One month later she has already travelled back to Venezuela where she is from (we are in Canada and she lives here now), to get her breast implants removed. The surgery just happened this week. She tried to get her ID changed back to her former name and gender, but the government is blocking it for now. (I'm still using ""she"" because she says she doesn't care which pronoun people use.) I think she will have to jump through a bunch of hoops once more to get everything reversed.

I have no idea how to support her. I'm terrified of saying anything because I don't know if I'm helping or hurting her. What if she's rushing in this de-transition at a time where she's vulnerable, and by supporting her I'm only encouraging her in making a decision she might regret? Or what if this is really the path for her and by questioning her, I'm only alienating her and bringing her down? I have no idea what's the right thing to do. I'm worried for her, and I want her to be happy, and to support her. I just don't know how to best do this right now.

So my transmasc friend and I were discussing using the restroom at work the other day and we both agreed on a few things...

If you start a new job no matter what your degree of transition you should immediately start using your restroom of choice from the beginning and do not ask permission. 

When you are using the restroom it’s best if you own it. Walk in there and act like you deserve to be there. Try your best to be as casual as everyone else.

In my own experience I found that it works better if you’re not timid or shy. At least in my case since I am male to female I learned that ladies talk to each other in the restroom. Be courteous and polite and if someone engages you in conversation try to follow through. 

In my experience it’s best to just act like you’ve been doing this forever and it’s completely normal. 

You don’t need to be militant about it but this behavior may help take some of the spotlight off of you and puts the burden of acceptance on others.  

I realize in some areas you may be restricted by the law and or you may be confronted by a-holes. Try to develop a nonthreatening and polite response in advance so you know what to say and you’re not caught off guard and looking guilty.

1226,2019-11-24 00:10:50,e0qmmf,19,1,"Hi! Im an 18 year old open minded.... something or other? So we all know stereotypes right and how children typically are right? Boys like blue, girls like pink right? (In general) Well as per the advice of my people on the bisexual teens reddit, kik, amino and an irl friend I've been told to experiment after spilling my guts out to them. I.e having struggling with my sexuality for a few years and frequently throughout my life question my gender though not having the awareness I do now.

Up until a year or two to go I doubled down on the idea that I'm just a straight white dude with somewhat of a wandering eye.. I wouldn't say I liked trans or men to my friends or family but there was something there. (I mean, I'd fantasise, read erotica and watch porn, research it ect). Now feel free to point this out if its stereotypical or me trying to point my finger at things I dont quite understand. As a kid (stereotypical?) And to a greater extent now I didnt and never have fit in, I was bullied because of that. I liked long hair and secretly I wanted so badly to be girly.. I loved pink and wanted to play with girls more than boys.. 

I grew up in a quite diverse area of Britiain, my friends were from all over but one of my closest friends was a pale poor-posh boy (who later turned out to be a treacherous asshole) and a jamaican tomboy (who later turned out to be a lesbian), we often played together and this is where my childhood gets very wierd. Me and the tomboy where quite close, I mean we knew each others parents names and we played out until it was pitch black. She really showed me how different I was to the other boys at my school, in fact she was more boisterous if truth be told and I always felt feminine around her. We were way too close as well, like weirdly. I had a few things, as did she, happen to me very early in childhood that sparked something quite wrong, we never 'you know' but yeah..

There were a few years were I prayed to god to make me a girl, I wanted a boyfriend and to have a baby and to be were a dress.. I even contemplated using a pair scissors to you know.. I wanted those things so much I cried but time moves on and memories and friends fade away. It wasnt until I was 14 when these things back. (Quick timeline this is messy, preschool to infantry school and junior is when most of this happened), I was in high school and the bullying was different, it stepped up a level. My friends came and went, I still had long hair and my large group of friends dwindled down to one who was addicted to xbox and a bit of a loner.

There was a girl (always is) a goth-emo hybrid who sort of became a hero of sorts in my eyes after I had a major panic attack when some people were picking on me. We never really chatted but we sat together in class and she was my real first crush, so real my heart ached every time I saw her and the few times she smiled at me. To cut things up a bit, I rarely attended school for almost two years and a bit after I was told I had social anxiety.. which only made things worse. She pulled me out of the gutter and helped me back to school. I cried on her shoulder, held her hand tight when I felt I was gonna loose it and always made an effort to be there for her. I started doing things to myself which I regretted instantly, i fell into a dark depression and she helped me stop. I took on her fashion and for the first time in years.. I wanted to be a girl.. I wanted my nails painted.. lipstick.. eye shadow.. skinny Jeans.. I wanted to be like her. My mom would straighten my hair and tell me I cant dye it black, she also had the patience to paint my nails the few times i did it before i got bullied for it.

We fell out over some stupid cunt who lied to us both and soon became Facebook friends. She has a kid now and sometimes my heart still bleeds for her. Which brings us roughly to now.. a fucking wreck. I dont know how I feel, old habits die hard, I'm struggling with everything and I'm going nowhere in life. I hate the way I look, I want and need to be more feminine, I still have long hair btw, I've been with a few men and a couple women.. but I still don't know. I've talked with gender fluid people, trans men, crossdressers. I watched countless videos and read more blogs than I care to admit. Now after this long winded, almost novel length story my question is, does any of this link up with other trans stories? Does this make sense, is this how you felt? I need to know, maybe then I can get some semblance of something to hold onto, to slowly fix myself. If you have stayed and read this long enough.. you deserve a fucking reward. I've heard a lot of people who are quite honest do say some things to get their treatment and stuff.. but i wouldn't know too much and I'd also like to say that my parents arent against anything. They wouldn't care but I fear it may change things.. my mother always wanted a girl and my dad always had boys.. but for one girl. I wasn't hurt or anything as a child but I saw and heard things I suppose children shouldn't.

We never really chatted but we sat together in class and she was my real first crush, so real my heart ached every time I saw her and the few times she smiled at me. To cut things up a bit, I rarely attended school for almost two years and a bit after I was told I had social anxiety.. which only made things worse. She pulled me out of the gutter and helped me back to school. I cried on her shoulder, held her hand tight when I felt I was gonna loose it and always made an effort to be there for her. I started doing things to myself which I regretted instantly, i fell into a dark depression and she helped me stop. I took on her fashion and for the first time in years.. I wanted to be a girl.. I wanted my nails painted.. lipstick.. eye shadow.. skinny Jeans.. I wanted to be like her. My mom would straighten my hair and tell me I cant dye it black, she also had the patience to paint my nails the few times i did it before i got bullied for it.\n\nWe fell out over some stupid cunt who lied to us both and soon became Facebook friends. She has a kid now and sometimes my heart still bleeds for her. Which brings us roughly to now.. a fucking wreck. I dont know how I feel, old habits die hard, I'm struggling with everything and I'm going nowhere in life. I hate the way I look, I want and need to be more feminine, I still have long hair btw, I've been with a few men and a couple women.. but I still don't know. I've talked with gender fluid people, trans men, crossdressers. I watched countless videos and read more blogs than I care to admit. Now after this long winded, almost novel length story my question is, does any of this link up with other trans stories? Does this make sense, is this how you felt? I need to know, maybe then I can get some semblance of something to hold onto, to slowly fix myself. If you have stayed and read this long enough.. you deserve a fucking reward. I've heard a lot of people who are quite honest do say some things to get their treatment and stuff.. but i wouldn't know too much and I'd also like to say that my parents arent against anything. They wouldn't care but I fear it may change things.. my mother always wanted a girl and my dad always had boys.. but for one girl. I wasn't hurt or anything as a child but I saw and heard things I suppose children shouldn't. \n\nSorry again if this is messy."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Question!

I try to be active within my communities, helping to organize existing events, moderating discussion and resource groups. I have also recently started to stream on Twitch, where I share my love of gaming and singing while discussing mental health, queerness, polyamory and disability.

I plan to return to school once I am financially stable, so that I can pursue a degree in theatre; this focus would include all of the skills I'm aiming to hone, including delegation of tasks, interpersonal communication, and emotional evocation. Presently, I cannot afford the books and fees that would not be covered by the FASFA, especially because I would likely need to remain a part-time student (9 credits or less a semester). My grandfather, bless him, has been continuously growing a college fund that will pay for the direct tuition fees, granting me the ability to return to school if I can get the stability to cover the rest.

I am actively working on goals and objectives for the future while trying to make ends meet as I battle for SSI and proper treatment. My goals for when I am financially stable are as follows: 

\- Go back to university/college and graduate (made possible by my generous and loving grandfather, who can cover the tuition but additional prices, such as textbooks etc).

\- Create/produce educational programs and videos about my mental health, my snake, and how they're related.

\- Fundraise for my community (pay it forward/pay it back).

\- Organize/create community events such as TransCon Boston, Queer Spoon Cabinet, and others.

\- Advocate for consideration, recognition, safety, and fair treatment towards and within my community.

This month especially has brought significantly higher expenses in bills, student loan payments, and lack of usual DTA assistance (which I am in the torturously long process of fixing). In total for November alone, I need to raise $1007 more to stay afloat. This is a daunting, terrifying number, and one I cannot reach on my own. Please, if you have anything to spare, small donations come together and move mountains. Or, in this case, build survival rafts.

I have also recently started to stream on Twitch, where I share my love of gaming and singing while discussing mental health, queerness, polyamory and disability.\n\nI plan to return to school once I am financially stable, so that I can pursue a degree in theatre; this focus would include all of the skills I'm aiming to hone, including delegation of tasks, interpersonal communication, and emotional evocation. Presently, I cannot afford the books and fees that would not be covered by the FASFA, especially because I would likely need to remain a part-time student (9 credits or less a semester). My grandfather, bless him, has been continuously growing a college fund that will pay for the direct tuition fees, granting me the ability to return to school if I can get the stability to cover the rest.\n\nI am actively working on goals and objectives for the future while trying to make ends meet as I battle for SSI and proper treatment. My goals for when I am financially stable are as follows: \n\n\\- Go back to university/college and graduate (made possible by my generous and loving grandfather, who can cover the tuition but additional prices, such as textbooks etc).\n\n\\- Create/produce educational programs and videos about my mental health, my snake, and how they're related.\n\n\\- Fundraise for my community (pay it forward/pay it back).\n\n\\- Organize/create community events such as TransCon Boston, Queer Spoon Cabinet, and others.\n\n\\- Advocate for consideration, recognition, safety, and fair treatment towards and within my community.\n\nThis month especially has brought significantly higher expenses in bills, student loan payments, and lack of usual DTA assistance (which I am in the torturously long process of fixing). In total for November alone, I need to raise $1007 more to stay afloat. This is a daunting, terrifying number, and one I cannot reach on my own. Please, if you have anything to spare, small donations come together and move mountains.

Im 36 yo pre every thing mtf. My best freinds dad just came out as trans. This is a person who has been emotionally and physically abusive most of my friends life, we are both in out mis 30s. His dad has had major issues with drugs and alcohol, having gone through rehab and AA multiple times. They lost their job a few years ago and this sent them in to a major downward spiral. 
Now my friends dad is comming out as transgender mtf, I gave suspected it for years. She is now blaming all the problems theyve had on being a closeted trans. She says they cant blam her for any thing shes done because she was suffering. I gave sevr8ak points in this. 

So point one. I wanna call BS on that. Just because you are in the closet dows not mean you get a free pass on being an ass hole. God knows I did plenty of ass hole things befire I had my own realization, my wife will bw happy to lost them for you. This had nothing to do with me being trans it had to do with me being an ass hole some times.  Nothing nearly as bad as my freinds dad, and terry and find some one whos reached their mid 30s with our some ass hole in them.  

Point 2. I was hoping to come out to my best freind at some point.  Would have done it already but his wife is the words biggest gossip and a major terf, so I've been holding off. Now I'm even more reluctant to come out to my freind at the moment cause he seems to think all transgebder people are these ass holes. Just seems to have s negative impression of transgender. I'm hoping this is a gut reaction to the news and ut will fade in time. 

Point 3. I'm torn between being able to connect to another transgender person irl snd the fact that this person is a complete ass hole that I never really liked.  I currently
Have no irl transgender freinds are even know any all and its unlikely I'll be making any soon. I have like no free time, money is tight. Also I am like the worst person in the world at making freinds, it's a skill that's always alluded me. And here is another transgender person I can talk to and possibly relate to, but their such a horrible person in gential, also it would be betraying my freind. It's like I'm a dog and some keeps showing me a treat and pulling it away. 

Point 4. I'm pissed off this person will be starting hormones soon. Its alot easier wheb you have no job and your wife is fitting your bill for your BS life style. And I'm sitting here wondering if or when I'll be able to start cause I have a carrer I actully like. And yeah I'm a little jealous. 


So that's my struggle this morning. 


TL;DR

Point 2. This makes it harder for me to come out because hes got a negative veiepoint/ association with transgenders now. 

Point 3. I'm torn between being able to make a connection with another IRL transgender women, a first for me. And the fact that this person us just horrible person also it would be a huge betrayal to my freind.

So I have come here, to take a look at your perspectives. Here a questions gathered from my time there. If they are offensive or misinformed please tell me.

1. Do you belive there are really people “faking” gender dysphoria, or mistaking it for something else?

2. What are your opinions on HRT and the quickness and rashness (can’t think of a better word rn) of taking them.

3.  How do you think about parents “forcing” it on children?

4. Do you think some sections of the trans community are cult like? Do you think horomone therapy or trans identity in general is pressured into people, especially young impressionable people?

5. What are your thoughts of Reiko’s Trap Harem and situations like it?

These are just some questions I can think of right now. If I can think of any more I will ask.

Went to my first gender therapy appointment today for a consultation and everyone was super nice and super accepting. I’m not in anyway presenting and am only out to one really good friend so I was pretty nervous. Not really sure how smooth my life will be going forward but I’m really excited to see what life brings. 20 years keeping it all in was really fucking hard, but my therapist said self preservation like that is extremely admirable and that made me feel so good. 

I don’t even really know why I am posting this. I guess maybe just to let some other people I’m not close with know. Hopefully my friends and family will be accepting of the new me in years to come, but I’m definitely not holding my breath. 

It just felt so damn good to check female on the preferred gender question. It’s so unreal. 

I hope all of you have a good holiday break and I am so totally down to make new friends on here. It’s all very new to me so I’d love to learn all I could.

I met a girl online, Ashleigh. At the time she was going by a different name. I found her by accident, while looking for dirt on a particularly nasty transphobe I had to interact with. A Reddit account with a similar username to the person I was searching's account. She had posts on r/trans, and some of them paralleled some of my own fears. She worried about her family, fearing that she wouldn't be accepted. She wondered if HRT would work for her, and hoped that her body shape would help her transition. She worried about where she would live, where she would work, if the worst happened and she got kicked out of her home. So I reached out to her.

She was the sibling of the person I despised, and that immediately interested me. How could two siblings be such polar opposites? We talked, ranted about her brother, got to know each other. I hadn't started HRT at that point and I we both discussed it eagerly, her wondering where she'd get the money and me wondering how I'd get a psychiatrist's approval. I found out she served in the army, and that she wanted to sing if she could ever get her voice high enough. I told her I was helplessly afraid of bloodwork, and discussed a guy who I was afraid would think I was flirting with him. It was probably the talking that built up her confidence, she changed her online profile to be female despite the risks, while still hoped her brother wouldn't find out.

A few weeks after, her brother did. He outed her to his entire Christian family, and convinced them to deny her transition. She didn't feel safe in her home anymore, and was struggling to find work so she could move out. Things turned around when she was able to get her first month of HRT. She was ecstatic, she told me it was like a weight had been lifted from her shoulders, that a fog had cleared. Life got busy for me and she messaged me less, so our conversations sort of dropped off from there. I thought she was happy. I thought she was okay.

On the 1st of November she asked me how I was doing. I said I was fine. She asked a few other questions, and I answered, but I didn't ask her how she was. I was panicking about money, worrying I would go broke, and I told myself I didn't have time to talk. I didn't hear anything from her after that. Tonight I found out she killed herself last Saturday. I saw an offhand post from her brother, still deadnaming her, still referring to her as male, saying that she killed herself because ""people on the internet convinced her the whole world and her family was against her."" He was the one that found her, and he wasn't even able to acknowledge that he caused it.

I don't think any of her family will remember her for who she was, and I don't think she had any other friends who knew. I'm not religious, but if I could say a few words to her, I'd say I'm sorry for not asking how she was. I'm sorry for prioritising myself above others. And I'm sorry for the situation she wound up in and the monsters she had to call family. I can't bear the thought of her dying with everybody remembering her as male, so I'm writing this in hopes that people will remember her the way she wanted to be remembered.

I am not out to anyone in my family or friends really, and it reallly fucking sucks. I am just tired and fed up with living a life that isn't mine. Yesterday, I went and got each one of my parents a card so I can let them process it. The only thing though is that I have no idea what to say. It just seems like an uphill battle, but Idk they might still love me :'). Coming out for the second time is way more nerve racking than the first time coming out as gay. I always say I don't care what anyone says, but in reality I do. I do care what my family and friends have to say negative or positive.

I will never be satisfied with my body because I can't change my bones.

 I want to give up opening myself to others because:

\- even if pass flawlessly I will always be seen as a male living as a woman. Even if I had a body with cis proportions, if people discovered I'm trans they will always think she has been/is a male, she's a man who become a woman. FUCK YOU.

\-I am a terrible friend. There is nothing interesting in me. I'm not exagerating or anything. All the people who begin to  show interest in me, stop being interested in me once they know me a bit more so I'm the one who always has to send the first message to talk with my friends. If I stop sending the first message to begin a conversation, my friends will never talk to me. The last time a friend send me a first message was in july, before that time it was june, and before that time I don't know maybe all my life?. From mid 2017 to mid 2019, I've stopped sending the first message to my friends and never someone messaged me. I'm confident that if I die tomorrow they won't even notice.  I consider myself to have had a few bestfriends during my life but no one ever considered me as their bestfriend.  I can't accept that I will always be optionnal.

We were so close we considered ourselves siblings. After trying for 3 years, I know I can't continue without her. In a year or two I will be forgotten by everyone forever. I will never have existed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Tomorrow if I choose to live, I choose to be alone all my life. I choose to be a freak all my life. I choose to kill my mental self/soul/whatever because my soul can't live in a body like the one I have. I choose to be a mindless body who has to constantly resist all the constant pain produced by loneliness, unachievable profeesionnal goals, hatered for my genetic family, hatered for anyone who knows I'm amab, fear of social interaction due to my hatered of how people see me (a shy man deppressed unfunny, weak) I'm gonna stop typing because every word I type makes me want to kill myself more.

To start off, I am not a Liberal, nor a Conservative, I am a Moderate. I started out as a brainwashed Right Wing Republican but became woke af during my time at college (go figure). As a relic of my Republican years, I still hold on to some of the same people I follow on FB/Twitter just so I can get a view from both sides of the ""aisle"" (more like bottomless chasm).

I am a cis woman, I think is the term. Although to be honest I don’t like it, I would rather refer to myself just as a woman. But for clarity I will use it.

I have great empathy for trans people, I also believe gender dysphoria is a terrible thing to have to suffer and I think everyone should have the right to identify as they please. 

However I also know men and women have very different physical abilities, it’s the reason men and women’s sports is separated. I have read that this split in abilities happens during puberty. Men develop bigger muscles, bones and heart size etc 

I read that of a trans woman transitions after puberty she keeps all these physical attributes even if her testosterone levels go down to a level more consistent with a cis woman. 
Which seems very unfair to me when it comes to competing together in sports.

But at the same time why shouldn’t trans woman have the right to compete competitively in sports. Would they even be able to compete with men if they are on hormonal medication that brings down their testosterone? 

Which leaves them where? 

On the other hand I do agree with the cis woman’s argument that it’s unfair, we have fought so long and hard for rights we never had, to be taken seriously in professional sports etc and it can feel like this is another form of patriarchal colonialism. (This is just my opinion not a fact) because woman just cannot physically compete with male bodies. 

What happens if all the top female athletes in the world are trans. Will cis women just give up trying to compete?

Now trans people have also being fighting for their own rights, and they deserve them. But in this case it feels like it’s at the expense of cis women.

Which again is also not fair to trans women, because when they are also amazing and talented and should be competing and showing their skills and hard work.

I feel so conflicted about this and I only see the cis woman’s perspective on you tube or wherever I look. So I would very much like to hear the trans woman’s perspective. 

Perhaps there is no easy answer to this, but I feel like I should hear how trans women feel about it.

1435,2019-11-27 18:04:37,e2jxn9,6,1," I'm a 28 y/o Canadian male, and the trans individuals I do know, I know as part of a periphery, not on a close or intimate level, so I have never really made an opportunity to ask. I don't mean to be ignorant, and I have done some reading but I'd like to know more specifics. To my understanding, many of life's barriers, and obstacles which face trans people stem from social culture, and lack of recognition, or acceptance. There are some examples I know whereby in the past, some statutes, policies, etc have been prohibitive and/or restrictive to the transgender community which has denied some rights:

* The shared washroom debate, and a lack of neutral restrooms
* Some militaries, (maybe police forces, and correctional facilities) prohibiting or deliberately not hiring trans people. (I was briefly an RCMP officer, there were were 2 or 3 trans persons in training, so on that front, one police force I know, is attempting to make some progress)
* restrictions, or prohibitions on access to gender alteration surgeries

Governments can, and in some cases, have addressed these. What can they do better? Overall, what can governments do to benefit your quality of life? In terms of hiring practices, my intuition is that there are few work places which actively restrict/prohibit the hiring of trans persons. The adversity faced is largely cultural and based on employer bias. The only thing I can think of to actively combat this would be including trans persons into an affirmative action-esque system which while it has benefits, is also flawed.

1456,2019-11-28 02:30:17,e2r8v6,4,1,"Hello my name is India Chung. I am a 23 year old trans woman living in Belfast Northern Ireland, I suffer an incredibly intense form of dysphoria that causes me to suffer extreme mental breakdowns where I can't stop screaming or injuring my own face. I have been suicidal for the past 15 years, with it reaching an agonizingly oppressive point in the last 6. All of my problems stem entirely from my dysphoria, which I experience at a much more intense, and chronic level than most people. I have cut my face many times in the past, but never before with my bare hands like this. I am trying to crowdfund for facial surgery but it is incredibly difficult. The first time I tried to kill myself I was 7 and I tried to hang myself from my bunk bed with my mother's jeans. When I was 16 I got admitted to beechcroft for suicidal tendencies which was a horrible experience and left when I was 17. My extreme suicidal tendencies were too much for my family and I ended up having to live in a hostel. It was there I was sexually assaulted and started to suffer very serious anger management issues, for example I smashed several of the guitars the staff had bought for the residents and got kicked out for threatening the team leader with violence and nearly hitting her. I ended up moving into a better hostel and then I got an apartment where I now live with someone else. I have called lifeline many times in the past and could continue to and nothing will ever actually change, I will still be explaining the same problem to the same people over and over again. My mother could drop dead tomorrow and I would not care. In school I used to walk around with my face covered through all school hours unless I was alone. The school actually gave me my own separate room to help with this. I am 23. It is many years later. I tied a noose and went to go hang myself several months ago but it didn't work out. As my gender dysphoria increases in intensity so does my anger and frustration, and I fear I will start to direct it at other people again.

I am a 23 year old trans woman living in Belfast Northern Ireland, I suffer an incredibly intense form of dysphoria that causes me to suffer extreme mental breakdowns where I can't stop screaming or injuring my own face. I have been suicidal for the past 15 years, with it reaching an agonizingly oppressive point in the last 6. All of my problems stem entirely from my dysphoria, which I experience at a much more intense, and chronic level than most people. I have cut my face many times in the past, but never before with my bare hands like this. I am trying to crowdfund for facial surgery but it is incredibly difficult. The first time I tried to kill myself I was 7 and I tried to hang myself from my bunk bed with my mother's jeans. When I was 16 I got admitted to beechcroft for suicidal tendencies which was a horrible experience and left when I was 17. My extreme suicidal tendencies were too much for my family and I ended up having to live in a hostel. It was there I was sexually assaulted and started to suffer very serious anger management issues, for example I smashed several of the guitars the staff had bought for the residents and got kicked out for threatening the team leader with violence and nearly hitting her. I ended up moving into a better hostel and then I got an apartment where I now live with someone else. I have called lifeline many times in the past and could continue to and nothing will ever actually change, I will still be explaining the same problem to the same people over and over again. My mother could drop dead tomorrow and I would not care. In school I used to walk around with my face covered through all school hours unless I was alone. The school actually gave me my own separate room to help with this. I am 23. It is many years later. I tied a noose and went to go hang myself several months ago but it didn't work out. As my gender dysphoria increases in intensity so does my anger and frustration, and I fear I will start to direct it at other people again.

So, the HRC (Human Rights Committee) just sent me some mail.

Normally I'm really happy when this stuff shows up to my apartment, which is in a different state.

Except

This mail arrived at my parents NEW address

In my DeadName

Where I no longer live or legally reside. (Due to weird laws in the state I attend college/actually live, I can't become a state citizen until I am out of college, so my legal address is my grandparents' house). My parents moved a while ago, and I've never lived in this location. It isn't my legal address. I honestly didn't even know my parents' new address, I hadn't visited since they moved and I hadn't needed to mail anything to them.

My parents are highly homophobic and often snoop in my mail. I was ***THIS*** close to being outted by HRC. Ya know, the organization fighting for LGBT rights and ***SAFETY***? Yeah, *that* committee. The committee that just put my life in danger AND almost cut me off completely from my family. I'm in the closet for a GODDAMN REASON. I live in a completely different state.

I still depend on them in some ways for food and rent due to being unable to work full-time while I'm in college. Also, I'd like to maintain a relationship with my sister, who is a minor and would probably be banned from communicating with me if my parents disowned me. Also, Idk, maybe I haven't come to terms with the fact that my parents might not really love me for who I am so I'm afraid to cut that illusion off? but D*ON'T JUDGE ME on that part, THe point is that thAT'S MY DECISION,* ***NOT*** ***HRC'S.***

Normally I\'m really happy when this stuff shows up to my apartment, which is in a different state.\n\nExcept\n\nThis mail arrived at my parents NEW address\n\nIn my DeadName\n\nWhere I no longer live or legally reside. (Due to weird laws in the state I attend college/actually live, I can\'t become a state citizen until I am out of college, so my legal address is my grandparents\' house). My parents moved a while ago, and I\'ve never lived in this location. It isn\'t my legal address. I honestly didn\'t even know my parents\' new address, I hadn\'t visited since they moved and I hadn\'t needed to mail anything to them.\n\nMy parents are highly homophobic and often snoop in my mail. I was ***THIS*** close to being outted by HRC. Ya know, the organization fighting for LGBT rights and ***SAFETY***? Yeah, *that* committee. The committee that just put my life in danger AND almost cut me off completely from my family. I\'m in the closet for a GODDAMN REASON. I live in a completely different state.\n\nI still depend on them in some ways for food and rent due to being unable to work full-time while I\'m in college. Also, I\'d like to maintain a relationship with my sister, who is a minor and would probably be banned from communicating with me if my parents disowned me. Also, Idk, maybe I haven\'t come to terms with the fact that my parents might not really love me for who I am so I\'m afraid to cut that illusion off? but D*ON\'T JUDGE ME on that part, THe point is that thAT\'S MY DECISION,* ***NOT*** ***HRC\'S.***\n\n*TL,DR;*\n\n**I DIDN\'T EVEN KNOW MY OWN PARENTS\' ADDRESS**.

A little bit of bio and opening up:

- Explored sexuality as a teen by looking porn. Discovered I reacted to trans women (not all of them) and not to porn featuring cis women (or very rarely) and not at all to men. Ditched it scared as temporary thing and probably a fetish.

- Infatuated most of the time by cis women (even with butterfly sensations).

- Rediscovered transgender women at uni when friends made fun of pictures of them and realized I still reacted to them. Again scared I dissmissed it as something temporary and probably a fetish.

- Few experience with relationships (non with trans). Most long one with a cis-woman. Felt like something was missing a bit (sexually), although we were intimate really often and there was a lot of romantic attraction and even long term plans. Break up for other reasons.

- Find secretly asking myself if my crushes are trans.

- Rediscovered trans women again in mid twenties. Informed myself better, followed blogs from women transitioning, read forums, read Reddit, news, scientific publications, etc. Tried to avoid it again. Started to have more and more fantasies about them. Ended up kind of accepting that this in some way could be my orientation, yet still avoiding it mostly.

- I keep avoiding the topic as when I read about it I see mixed opinions on the internet. People that say this is objectification, fetish, this means one likes people for being trans and not the person, etc. And people that say that trans are mentally ill and need a cure. And it all confuses me.

- I have transphobic friends and relatives.

Right now I feel confused in part due to the fact that I do realize that I somehow have some level of transphobia probably. I mean, I do admit that I react sexually to trans women when I watch erotic content, but right now I can't shake my mind from the biologic reality, which in some way makes me avoid meeting them because the very same moment I think of them as men I get repulsed. And I don't know how to solve this to be honest. another point is I feel like dating transwomen asks for a psychological strength that I don't have right now and I feel I can't convince myself to do it. I empathize with the fact that no one wouldn't like to date someone that is not ready to date with them long term. I mean I am too scared to even talk with them at a cafe and risk being seen and what could happen next (work, family, friends, neighbors, etc.). And what if I discover I don't feel attracted to real life transgender women while dating one? I don't want to hurt someone emotionally, I think they have to deal with enough things on their life to add this icing of the cake on their emotional struggles. I feel like the more I try to avoid the topic, the more fantasies and feelings of wanting to do something about it I have. Right now I am young, average looking, healthy and with good career and studies. I feel like in the future I don't want to be one of those 40+ or 50+ old dudes that repulses 20 something transwomen.

I can't picture myself using grindr or tinder. I tried OkCupid for dating cis women but become too clingy easily, and I am too scared to approach a transgender woman, to a point I just tend to swipe them left due to all the anxiety it produces me (what if it's a scam? What if it's a prank profile?

I kind of want to try to at least explain myself and hear my side of the story to be heard. I’m not expecting anyone to want to talk to me or anything but it would be nice. The guilt is eating me up inside and i can’t take it anymore.

Before I get started I just want to say, I’m truly sorry and want to apologize for any kind of pain I caused, I just couldn’t take anymore of not being the true me, and some of you did not take it as well as I had hoped. I’m sorry. I hurt some of you. There’s nothing I could ever do to make up for it.

For some reason today I decided to get answers for why mutual friends I had with Claire all kind of dropped me except for like 2. I snapped Taylor, the one that hasn’t unadded me or told me they never wanna speak with me and asked her. She told me that everyone hates me because “i broke Claire’s heart, painted her as a transphobe and left without saying bye”

I understand hating me because of point 2, but point 1 I feel is unfair. I don’t understand how I’m the one that broke her heart if she was the one that said I had to choose between her or being myself. How is that my fault if she still loved me and she left me because she couldn’t be with a woman, even saying earlier in the relationship she was bi.

Looking back on it, I basically told everyone that asked “she left me because I’m trans” which is kind of true but not really? So I’ll take that one. I understand how you could interpret that as transphobic.

I left without saying bye because I saw that everyone was hanging out with her and not ever inviting me out, so I took that as they weren’t my friends anymore. To this day I can’t even see a picture of her without crying (it’s getting better tho, I’m almost to the point I can fight back the tears). So even after most of my identity crisis was “dealt with” (that’s the best way I could describe that), I did not want to see her in any capacity, especially with my friends. 

None you have to respond to this, and if you made it this far thank you for that, for listening to what I had to say, even if you think it’s complete bullshit. I have just had this guilt eating me up inside. If anyone wants me to elaborate on anything, I will. Most importantly, if this changed your opinion on me, don’t let it change your opinion of Claire. I don’t hate any of you.

I made eye contact with her and she immediately looked away shyly. That’s when it became obvious to me that she was transitioning, and not for long. I knew, because I too had once been her. 

5 years ago, I felt unshakably certain that I could  no longer wait another day to live the rest of my life honestly. But all that honestly hurt a lot sometimes. When people would look at me funny or whisper to a friend, words that I couldn’t actually hear but I was certain would sound a lot like “look; check out that tranny in that green dress”, I really wanted to crawl up in a fetal position and cry for days. 

But I couldn’t do that. At least not in front of anyone else anyway. I was determined to ignore the mental simplicity’s of my community and just push myself to just learn something new about passing or failing every time I’d venture out into the public. 

I let my passing failures teach me. Malls were my classrooms. One of my shangri la’s was the MAC counter. I eventually learned to make that my first stop. That way I’d get one of the techs to do my face first before venturing out into stores. I’d also pick up makeup techniques every time. 

So, yesterday, I almost kept walking, not wanting to be disrespectful of this woman’s privacy. But something inside me needed to pass on some things I’d learned when I first transitioned. I wanted to pay it forward, and pass on some girl power mojo. 

So, I said “miss?” She turned, looking frightened as f**k. Then I whispered quietly so I didn’t draw attention to her, “I’m your sister babe, you and I are the same. If you want a friend, I’d be happy to show you around. If you prefer your privacy, I’m happy to leave.” 

She stuck her hand out as if to shake mine, her hand trembling, but her face was smiling from ear to ear. I just reached out to hug her which always works better for me. The hug worked. 

I walked her over to the MAC counter where I’d just left, still holding my bag of concealer, and I introduced her to the girl who regularly helps me and just said, “do you mind doing my friends makeup, I want her to try you’re brand to convince her how bad she needs to ditch her cover girl products.” That’s all it took. We found some eye shadow she liked and the rest was glamorous history. 

Afterwards, I walked with her through the mall and coached her a little more. We exchanged numbers and I left feeling like I’d cured cancer. I felt amazing. 

I’m not the most beautiful woman my mirror has ever seen for sure, mostly passable at best, but yesterday I knew, despite my own imperfections, that I needed to help her. Her shyness overtook my conscience and I knew she needed help. 

Hopefully, five years from today, she will do the same.",trans,Paying it forward,1575025309.0,"{'created_utc': 1575000109, 'id': 'e39dvj', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Yesterday I was leaving the MAC counter at a nearby mall when I noticed a very tall woman approaching my direction.

So a good few years back, I came out to my parents as being bi. All was well, their only concern was ""putting a label on it."" But they were fine about it, my dad is a lot more supportive in what I do though. So naturally when I stopped repressing my trans thoughts (over the course of 6-7 years or so, I had thoughts of being trans but always pushed them down and told myself to be a man or whatever.) a couple months ago, I told my dad before my mom. Again, he said I shouldn't put a label on it, but was actually helping me find a medical professional to talk to about all that. It was a hard conversation, but my dad listens much more than he speaks, and when he does speak, it's something meaningful and thought out. My mom is the opposite, she talks over me, interrupts me, and just says every thing that enters her head. Oh, and what with being depressed and all the dysphoria stuff I've had for 6 or 7 years, I've lost any semblance of self confidence. So I doubt myself a lot, in everything I think and say and do. There's barely ever a time I'm 100% sure of something. I'm really really really pretty sure I'm trans though, so I wanted to at least talk to a professional about it and see what I could do if I am. So I told my dad, yaddah yaddah, next day my mom can tell something's on his mind so he texts me to ask if it's okay if he talks to her a little bit about it. Y'know, since they're married and stuff. So I said along the lines of ""yes, but if you can avoid it, do so."" She knew at least part of it, when I got around to finally telling her last night (after putting it off for weeks because I thought this would happen) and honestly I've never felt worse about all this. I even opened up more than I ever have with them, in more ways than one. I touched upon stuff I hadn't told a single soul, and my mom just bounced it back at me with shit like ""how can you be sure?""

Now, I will admit, I'm a shut in. I don't like to be, but I'm dealing with a lot, and I thought I'd found the root of a lot of my problems. (The whole trans thing, that is.) So my mom's logic is basically: because I don't get out enough, I can't know I'm trans. So I *want* to say to myself ""Yeah, I'm sure about all this and I should stand my ground"" or whatever.

The actual post is stupid and barely related, but it sparked a flame war in the comments.

Important notes: I am not trans and have never knowingly met a trans person either in person or through the internet, which is why I wanted to post this. I also cannot stress enough that you don't go and harass this person. Sure, they're opinions are pretty dumb, but harassing him will only allow him to bury himself deeper into his anti-trans hole.

So basically, this guy was arguing that people need to be less sensitive about their feelings, blah blah blah, and that we were trying to force him to stop saying what he wanted to say, and when I responded that nobody was saying that and that we were just telling him that we disagreed with his opinions and that he was being offensive, he insisted that just because I'm not legally mandating him to stop right now doesn't mean I wouldn't support legislation to do just that in the future. I continued by telling him that was based on nothing, but he wouldn't have any of it. Furthermore, another person joined in and replied to me ""Common Alt right arguments deconstructed #1: trying to villainize those who they disagree with"" in response to me deconstructing his argument that we are all trying to silence him and telling him that he is just creating a victim complex, and this guy assumes he was talking about ME, saying that we are so quick to insult him simply because we disagree with him (which I don't remember doing, but I got a little heated, so I might have done).

Basically, what I want is to know whether taking part in this argument was a good idea and whether I went about it correctly, having never met a trans person and not being one myself. Was engaging in the first place a mistake? Did I accidentally say something wrong at some point? Should I have said some things differently? I really want to be an ally here, but I'm afraid that I don't entirely know what I'm doing. Any pointers would be greatly appreciated.

1630,2019-11-30 21:07:40,e43hs9,8,1,"hello! I'm kinda stuck in a bit of a dilemma and I think advice and help from trans people is the best option
I'm an 18 year old female but since I was about 10 I always had the idea that I 'wanted to be a boy'. Any online games I'd play I'd end up making a male character, I was really into the idea of crossdressing and I was not very feminine (nor was I masculine tbh) and at times when people would give me nicknames or something I'd always go by the male version (idk how to describe it without it sounding weird but friends used to call me things like 'king' and 'dad' lol)

I never really thought about it tbh but within the past year I'd say? I've been constantly fantasizing about what it'd be like to be a boy and I've convinced myself I'd be so much more confident and happy if I was a guy. I got into more stereotypical feminine things like shopping and makeup, and from 14-16 I had no problems wearing skirts and girly clothes. Though now I feel extremely self conscious wearing dresses and I only feel comfortable wearing one skirt I own, but this is only on days I feel good about my appearance lol.
Typically I wear oversized boys shirts and hoodies tucked into jeans but I've been really wanting to buy more mens pants and appearing less feminine. I've also always been insecure about showing my breasts lol, I'd never wear shirts or things that show cleavage and always cover it up fully but idk if thats really relevant
I've started to experiment with my appearance and I think I'm going to cut my hair short.

Honestly, the idea that I might be trans never crossed my mind until recently. I feel as though 18 is too old to realise and I don't think I experience dysphoria? I honestly think I'm insecure of my body bc its not as nice as other girls i know irl and my face isn't conventially attractive but I can't stop fantasizing about being a guy.

1636,2019-11-30 23:36:35,e45oi9,1,1,"The song Reflection from Mulan is literally such a trans anthem! I’ve legitimately nearly cried while listening to it. In case y’all don’t know, these are the lyrics: 
Look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be I'm not meant to play this part 
Now I see
That if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight, back at me
Why is my reflection someone I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am
Though I've tried
When will my reflection show who I am inside
When will my reflection show who I am inside

Let’s unpack this. 
First off, Mulan sings “ I will never pass for a perfect bride or a perfect daughter.” I mean, come on. Self-doubt related to “passing”!? Sounds pretty trans🤭
Next, Mulan asks “ Can it be I'm not meant to play this part”. I see this as Mulan fully realizing the possibility of being trans.
After this, Mulan says “Now I see
that if I were truly to be myself, I would break my family's heart.” Obviously Mulan lives in ancient China where everyone probably didn’t like trans people. Mulan knows that coming out is not an option.
Next Mulan asks “ Who is that girl I see
staring straight, back at me”. I see this as Mulan being so confused that looking in a mirror shows someone unrecognizable.
The last part goes like this:”Somehow I cannot hide who I am though I've tried.
When will my reflection show who I am inside?” This is basically just Mulan wanting so badly to be true to her desires, but at the same time knowing that it’s necessary to hide it.

A lot of the movie also hints at this, and I’m excited to see what y’all think!

I have just recently come to accept the fact that I am nonbinary, and I'm still a little shaken up about it considering the fact I've grown up in a homophobic family, and it was hard enough for me to accept the fact I liked girls. But, besides that, I need some help. A lot honestly. And I have a couple questions.

I have a large chest, and I'm not out to anybody yet so I cant buy a real binder. How else could I bind or at least hide my chest a little. I genuinely hate waking up every morning and getting dressed and seeing my chest, and I hate seeing it in shirts. So binding would really help.

How do I come out? Theres only one person I want to come out to, my sister in law. She helped me a lot and was supportive when I told her I liked girls, considering shes bi. She supported me, but now I'm not sure how to come out as nonbinary. Obviously I'm going to wait a bit, but how do I tell her when the time is right?

How do I cover up my feminine features? I know baggy clothes are an option, but is there any other way? I know this one is a dumb question, but I want to know.

How do I try and comfort myself or feel comfortable on days where I feel feminine, where  I want to rip off my chest and get rid of my curves and feminine face, and I just feel horrible all around? It happens at least 2-3 times a month, (at the least) and I dont know how to help myself. Its the worst feeling and I wish I didnt have to feel it.

But, besides that, I need some help. A lot honestly. And I have a couple questions.\n\nI have a large chest, and I'm not out to anybody yet so I cant buy a real binder. How else could I bind or at least hide my chest a little. I genuinely hate waking up every morning and getting dressed and seeing my chest, and I hate seeing it in shirts. So binding would really help.\n\nHow do I come out? Theres only one person I want to come out to, my sister in law. She helped me a lot and was supportive when I told her I liked girls, considering shes bi. She supported me, but now I'm not sure how to come out as nonbinary. Obviously I'm going to wait a bit, but how do I tell her when the time is right?\n\nHow do I cover up my feminine features? I know baggy clothes are an option, but is there any other way? I know this one is a dumb question, but I want to know.\n\nHow do I try and comfort myself or feel comfortable on days where I feel feminine, where  I want to rip off my chest and get rid of my curves and feminine face, and I just feel horrible all around? It happens at least 2-3 times a month, (at the least) and I dont know how to help myself. Its the worst feeling and I wish I didnt have to feel it. \n\nThat's pretty much it, I have some more questions but I'll wait.

And lately I’ve just been switching between these to terms. Lately though, as in the past 5 months I’ve been occasionally questioning my gender.

It has only happened a couple of times, and it’s always been about whether I’m nonbinary or cis (I’m biologically female). The first time it happened I remember looking in the mirror and wishing I had a more, well, straight body. No hips, or anything like that. And thinking that when I’m older I’d get a surgery to make me still look like a girl, just less, curvy. 

I saw people on here say that as non binary that they hated their period and never felt connected to it. I don’t hate it, but I never really ever acknowledged it. Even now, I don’t tell anyone each month unless I need anything. I used to tell people about it, but as I continued to go through puberty I cared less and less.

I’m not sure whether I have always been confident in a feminine identity. When I was younger for sure, but once I started elementary I stopped caring about how I portrayed myself. I always had mainly guys as friends. I kind of always had a resentment towards stereotypically feminine things. Except did I ever have problems with being referred to as a she? I honestly have no clue. I always referred to by my name so I can never tell.

The thing is that I'm not sure if I just reject gender stereotypes (because in my opinion the idea that your gender defines your personality is bollocks) or if I'm actually non binary. I've been struggling with my gender for over ten years now.  Most of my childhood I just said fuck gender and was just able to be a person without it mattering. I never got on with the boys or the girls, I was always alone and I always hated being referred as a girl and wearing stereotypical clothing and having long hair and doing girly things. When I was about ten I found out what transgender in the binary sense meant and I was like ""oh, this makes sense"" and for about six months I wore makeshift binders in secret and I chopped off all my hair and pretended to be a cis boy when I was alone. But then I realised that that didn't fit me either, I'm certainly not a man (at least I know that for sure) and honestly, since I've hit my teen years I've grown to love a lot of stereotypically female things like dresses and make-up and I've become more comfortable with my exterior. I like feminine aesthetics and I'm not male so I've been assuming for a long time that I'm just a wierd girl. But on the inside I still find it really hard to identify with the idea of being female, it still doesn't sit right with me. I struggle to relate to women and when I did gender studies in college (it's a part of the English language course and is very cis lead, concentrating on the difference in ways males and females think, behave, speak, etc) it made me feel physically sick because I think in many ways in a more ""male"" way according to the lessons and everyone was speaking about their genders and they were so comfortable and I couldn't answer any of the questions about what it is to be ""a girl"". I only just discovered recently what non binary actually means as I come from a transphobic household where the main concept is that you are born male or female and that is who you are forever. The term makes quite a bit of sense for me now that I have a better understanding of what it means although I'm not entirely sure yet whether it fits or not. 
What worries me is that I may have just met a lot of nonbinary people recently and seen more online representation and that I may be just subconsciously copying others and transferring my emotions around finally coming to terms with liking women and being fully gay into something else. I don't want to say that I'm nonbinary and then realise that I'm wrong and it was just a phase and I'm just a lesbian because that would badly misrepresent people who really are nonbinary and obviously I know that this is a serious and real thing. I also don't want people to think that I'm not really serious because I wear feminine clothing, but at the same time I don't want to change myself because this isn't about that for me, it's about figuring out who I already am and finding a way of describing myself which feels comfortable. This less about the physical more about the mental and social for me. I'm also afraid of the trouble that it will cause if I change my pronouns (I'm OK with my birth name thankfully) because tbh I don't feel valid and I know that people would slip up and it would be a whole thing.

Hi friends! I'm an AFAB lesbian. I've always thought I was a cis woman but lately I've been having some really intense dysphoria surrounding my period and uterus. I've wanted a hysterectomy for as long as I can remember but my dysphoria has gotten pretty bad in the last year or so. (A little graphic) when I'm on my period I feel like reaching in and ripping my uterus out (don't worry, I won't do that haha). 


Here's what I'm conflicted about: I know that having a uterus/period isn't synonymous with being a woman. The only reasons I want to be a woman are that I identify as a lesbian and have a ""feminine"" presentation. I realized that I don't need to identify as a woman to do either of those things. I recently got a pixie cut and it feels so right. I've also been dressing more androgynous and it feels wonderful. I also wish I had a deeper voice.


On the other hand, I'm fine with my chest (in fact, I could go bigger). I love my name (woman's name) and so far I'm fine with she/her pronouns. But my concern is that these are all surface level things and I need to do some more reflection to figure out how I really feel.


Sorry this got so long, but do any of y'all feel the same way? Is there anything I should focus on during this process? What advice would you give your younger self as they were questioning?

71,2019-11-28 07:12:12,e2ug31,3,1,"I've been thinking a lot about my gender identity for the past six months and how something didn't feel quite right, and a few days ago I was thinking about being nonbinary and felt completely thunderstruck. However I'm still working through what I actually am and what to do about it.

I've never felt any dysphoria over being called a man or ""one of the boys"" and I've never cared about being he/him, though I've recently begun to think I might prefer they/them. But I've also never been at all enthusiastic about anything masculine, particularly visually. I've never cared about the clothes I wear, or how my hair looks, or wanted to be muscular. I never thought I looked good, the best I ever felt was that I was ""ok.""

When I was thinking about being nonbinary I realized I really wanted to wear more feminine clothing and present androgynous, and I began to get excited about styles and how I would feel, which is new for me. However, I feel trapped about how to do that because I have a deep voice, broad-ish shoulders, and **very** thin hair with a serious receding hairline (I swear to god I'm only 23). I was trying on women's clothes with my girlfriend and I felt great until I saw my face in the mirror and it felt like I was having a panic attack. Hormones are currently off the table for me as I would like to have bio-children and lack the means to preserve my sperm.

Is it odd that I am so focused on the visual aspects of being nonbinary? Or that I've never felt terribly bothered by being a man? And what can I do without hormones to let me not freak out looking at myself while trying to dress more femme? I feel terrified of just being ""a man in a dress"" and I'm already a fairly self-conscious person. How do I know I'm not just inventing these feelings and that they'll stay?

I never thought I looked good, the best I ever felt was that I was ""ok.""\n\nWhen I was thinking about being nonbinary I realized I really wanted to wear more feminine clothing and present androgynous, and I began to get excited about styles and how I would feel, which is new for me. However, I feel trapped about how to do that because I have a deep voice, broad-ish shoulders, and **very** thin hair with a serious receding hairline (I swear to god I\'m only 23). I was trying on women\'s clothes with my girlfriend and I felt great until I saw my face in the mirror and it felt like I was having a panic attack. Hormones are currently off the table for me as I would like to have bio-children and lack the means to preserve my sperm.\n\nIs it odd that I am so focused on the visual aspects of being nonbinary? Or that I\'ve never felt terribly bothered by being a man? And what can I do without hormones to let me not freak out looking at myself while trying to dress more femme? I feel terrified of just being ""a man in a dress"" and I\'m already a fairly self-conscious person. How do I know I\'m not just inventing these feelings and that they\'ll stay? I feel completely out of my depth and just need someone with experience to talk to.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinaryTalk', 'title': 'AMAB very confused and need help', 'created': 1574950332.0}"

Anyway online people overwhelmingly recommend this shop. I got there and told the lady that I was a transgirl looking for her first bra.

She just bought quite a number of things. And asked if I was okay with her seeing me topless for a fitting. She asked me if it was okay touching me when I needed help. And just asked how I felt about certain bras. What I liked. If I felt good in it. Eventually I did pick one.

It was really lovely and I can see why people recommended it. I ended up spending $22 which I hear is quite cheap.

She told me that my size was 38B.

So I'm 2 Months into hrt. I'm not unhappy with my size and I know everyones different and it will probably change.

TL;DR I really like being a woman, but I just really want a penis.

I'm 21 years old. I was born female. In the last year or so I've been learning a lot about myself. I've broken up with my abusive ex boyfriend and started a new life with a wonderful person. Getting out of this abuse environment has lead me to have more time to think about - and work on - myself. 

I've accepted the more feminine side of myself. I love make-up, I love making my hair look good, I love buying clothes that make me feel good and sexy. And this makes me feel good too! Finally the energy I spent keeping my ex happy, I'm spending on making myself feel amazing!

However I've noticed something that's been there all my life. I get this intense jealousy of guys jerking off. Today was especially hard hitting. I've always kind of joked about wanting a penis but today it actually made me feel hostile toward my partner in a way I never really expected.

TMI: I have a little bit of experience with pegging and honestly it's one of the greatest epiphanies I've had ever. I love walking around with the strap-on on. Whenever I have fantasies pretty often I'm the one doing the stereotypical male moves. But then the other way around is awesome too.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what to think about this and I'm honestly really confused. Could I be genderqueer? If I present as a binary woman yet have this lingering desire to have male genitalia? 

And does that make me less of a woman? I don't think so though. 

I'd really love to hear thought/stories/opinions from more people like me. I come from a very binary background and until a bit ago genderfluid/genderqueer was unbelievable to me.

a bit about my story so far:

i was raised Mormon and served a mission for the Mormon church then came out as bisexual returning from my mission. after which, I married my ex-wife and while married told her I thought I might fall under the trans umbrella. i rapidly left the Mormon faith publicly (in reality I had not believed for years).

after my divorce I did not know where my transition would lead me--I wasn't sure about my gender. my therapists have all been unsuccessful in helping me pin down a gender many of them wanting me to pick male or female saying that if I transition with hormones or any surgeries I should be landing on the binary.

i am not a woman, I am not a man, i am ""third-gendered,"" i use the pro-nouns they/them

47,2019-11-06 03:24:59,dsagkh,0,1,"Hi all, just got a throwaway account to post here (not much of a reddit person, but excited about the community). I'm sort of in the midst of questioning my gender identity &amp; I guess I'm just curious if others have had my experiences/see if there are some common threads?  Anyway, this is kind of a long essay, so buckle up! I really hope some of y'all take the time to read it though. TL;DR older afab person identified as butch for a long time, now wondering about being genderqueer, would love to get advice and guidance (or even just support and recognition) from people who've experienced similar things!   


I'm afab and have been a ""tomboy"" pretty much my whole life. I'm in my early 30s and when I was growing up, in high school and college and such, i was exposed to binary trans identities (in fact, my best friend from high school transitioned FTM shortly after we graduated) and LGBTQ+ identities, but genderqueer/NB wasn't really a ""thing"" so much. In college I pretty comfortably fell into the box of being a butch bi woman, and gave myself permission to lean hard into the butchness after I graduated. Recently, i've come to realize, mostly from knowing and interacting with some younger queers, that if I had been born five or ten years later, and grown up with this current generation, that I think I would have identified as genderqueer. I feel like I fell into being a butch woman because that was the best word I had to describe myself at the time, but now maybe there are better words?   


Only now, have I started to really think about my relationship with my gender. At first I was like, I can't be genderqueer, I'm definitely a woman. But then I asked myself why I thought i was a woman (a question which, believe it or not, I have never before felt comfortable addressing) and I realized that the only times I really feel a strong allegience to my gender at birth are when i feel discriminated against or bullied because of my sex. Essentially, I only ever feel like a woman when I realize I'm afraid to walk somewhere alone after dark and my cis male friends aren't, or when I am at my job (in a very male dominated field) and someone makes a sexist remark. This last part is especially complicated for me, because this female solidarity has been very important for me in getting through the training process at my job and dealing with harrasment, and that kind of solidarity is something I wouldn't want to give up if I embraced a genderqueer identity. But, when I look inside myself, I really don't feel any particuar way about gender. I don't feel like a woman at all. I don't feel like a man either. If someone were to say to me, don't think about how others treat you, just think about yourself, how do you know you're a woman? My honest answer would just be, I don't.

After a few months of such questioning, I started experimenting a bit with presentation. I have always been quite butch, but never done much to hide feminine elements of my body, and whenever I've had to go to a formal event, I've worn a dress. In fact, I've always hated formal events because they require navigating female formal wear, which has always generated terrible feelings that I now recognize may have been dysphoria. This summer, i went to a friend's wedding in a suit and I felt glorious. I felt really handsome, like I looked good, a way I never feel when I wear a dress. After a month of experimenting with sports bras, I bought my first binder and found I enjoyed the look some days, but not others (I'm small chested to begin with, but the way the binder reduced my chest to nothing felt amazing on days when I wanted it). I also started letting my body hair grow out, which I've been less comfortable with (perhaps because it pushes my look over the androgenous line and too far into male territory?).   


Also an NSFW addition \[mods please tell me if this paragraph doesn't abide by group rules, I'll delete it--not meant to be explicit, just a part of my experience that's been really important\] I started having strap on sex, and holy fuck it's awesome. I've used a strap on before in several previous relationships, but its always been one that's colorful and not really dick shaped (#feminism lol). Even though I've been wearing it, it's always been for my partner's pleasure if that makes sense, just like, a more efficient way to use a toy, not a part of me. Well, this summer I invested in a dick of my own, that looks about the same color as my skin, and I...absolutely love it. Its not the only way I enjoy having sex, but using it, solo or with my (cis male bisexual) partner when I'm in the right mood has been amazing.   


So, all this to say, I'm excited about this journey. I still sometimes wonder if I'm allowed the label of genderqueer. Am I just a butch woman? I think a lot of this self doubt comes from being a bit older than most of the people I see using the genderqueer label, and from feeling like I just want to be me, and I don't want it to be like...a political label. Also, I am all for other people using they/them pronouns, but I just can't wrap my head around it for myself. Perhaps after 30 years of thinking she/her, it's just a habit I won't be able to break? I've heard from others that you don't need to use they/them pronouns to be NB or genderqueer, but it still really makes me sad when I'm in ""woke"" spaces and we go around and say our pronouns and I feel like saying ""she/her"" will imply to everyone else in the circle that I'm comfortable being a woman (\*yes I know about the Contrapoints controversy kicked off by a similar statement, and I'm in no way saying that pronoun go arounds are bad, just that for me in particular, at this stage in my journey, they are the opposite of validating!)

53,2019-11-06 14:53:40,dshd8w,6,18,"Preamble: 40 something Non-Binary AMAB.

Ive started my journey, and I fully accept who I am. So this weekend past, I went up to the mountains, and while there, tried my best to go into girl mode, something I have yet to do publicly by myself (alone).  I would say for the most part the experience was rather a mixed bag.

I started the Saturday in town (its relatively small) in Off Pink pattern Leggings, a really cute print top, and nike's. I was for the most part left well enough alone. I am by zero means passable in any way (Really I dont care if I am or not), but I tell you what, it was about the most wonderful feeling Ive had in my life ever. For the most part no one seemed to care or much less give it any attention. The girl in the toy shoppe told me my top was really cute and asked me where I bought it from (I told her Torrid). Then I wandered further into town, got some food (also again, no really odd looks or mean comments), and then continued shopping. While shopping of course, I did run into the local street preacher who was screaming his hellfire and brimstone at the people around. Now one look at me and I immediately got a ""Look at this abomination destined for the hell fires of satan and his lot."" Which I really did not care about at all. Screw this guy and his bullshit really.

Well after that of course I went back to my room, and daring all caution to the wind, put on my black maxi dress, hose, and flats, and then preceded to head over to the restaurant next door (I really wasnt much more brave than that). The hostess commented on my look saying it looked nice and then seated me. No problems still, started feeling confident actually. Ordered my food, and then went onward to eat. While eating however, I got a MAGA hat person who walked over to me and brazenly said that I was ""Whats wrong with America, and that I should go home and put some pants on. Trump is going to deport all you weirdo people, so we dont have to look at you. You make me sick."" Well that hurt my pride actually quite a bit, but I said nothing, ignored them, and continued eating. They flicked me off, told me to go $#%\^ myself, and then walked out (I guess).

So I finished my dinner, preceded to pay my bill and walk quietly back to my room. Again, no real issues there. Got to my room slinked into a nice blue and black lace nightie, picked up my copy of Walden (reading it again, after many years), and read till I fell asleep.

So the night went on, and I got up in the morning, got things together, and left the hotel (back in girl mode leggings and a really fem looking flannel) , checked out (the counter person stared at me a bunch and made faces), and then put the stuff in the car and drove down to the breakfast spot in town thats so nice. Walked up , asked for one seat, and the girl looked at me and said

""We dont serve you here."". She said.

I scoffed.

""Who do you think I am exactly?"" I said.

""You weird gay faggot types. You are welcome in our place."" She said.

Didnt get emotional, I just asked to speak to her manager, and politely asked why I could not be seated. The manager took one look at me and said nothing, and walked off (was wearing a JESUS gives tshirt). So I politely indicated I would leave a not so nice Yelp rating, carried on down to the local mcdonalds (they didnt care at all actually, girl was nice to me) ate a biscuit and left for homeward.

This was my weekend experience in a small town. Very hit or miss, and really the first time alone that I tried to express myself alone. Now to be fair Im 6'6 and about 275. Unlikely anyone is going to try starting anything with me. But still.

In addition to this I'm now starting to really struggle with the left over trauma from my father as a life long belief has been revealed a lie which further makes it difficult to express my identity to her.

 🐵this seems all over the place, and it kind of is, go to the next monkey if you wanna see the bit about me being nonbinary.

Recently I did a dna test to prove if I'm really any kind of native American, as my dad, throughout my life up until about 15, when i had to stop seeing him due to his malicious manipulative behavior and drug use, always said his real father was native American and so was his great grandmother.

 Taking a 23andme, I learn that i am not native. I'm snow white, 99% European. I was pretty heart broken to say the least because i was excited to be apart of a culture close to home. To have proof that I can participate in cultural activities without the threat of some one accusing me of appropriating and it also furthered proved how much more of a lie my father really was. I wanted to hold out hope that my father was an honest and whole person with me. That even though drugs may have destroyed his morality and his narcissism was destructive, that he still loved me. So this seemingly small detail i held onto for so long, is seriously messing with me.

after that night my mom asked this after noon, if ""I was over my identity crisis yet""
When i told her ""no"" she didn't give me time to explain and it wasn't as if i wanted to anyway, she would just blow me off. She asks ""why?"" And then proceeds to go onto a tangent or lecture about how genetics work, and if I had native heritage it would have been watered down. 
I understand this, but genetics isn't whats hurting me and i cant find myself to tell her the truth without fear that she'll use it as ammunition later.

She follows  ""that I should make my own identity"" but everytime I've confronted her before now, about my possible nonbinary identity, she has shut me down and said ""my dad broke me"" as if he had anything to do with how i want to define myself previously.

🐵
I believe I am Nonbinary. I find great discomfort in dressing as a woman or as a man. Ive always found comfort in the grey area of everything, I constantly project images of what i want to be onto Original characters i make, and most often these characters reflect an ambiguous body. Where they look some what feminine without losing the masculine edge. 

When I first started bleeding, a very kind teacher explained to me how important it was this was happening for me, how this was me blossoming into womanhood and growing into responsibility. I remember feeling nauseas about the statement ""you're becoming a young woman!"" For years after and i couldnt understand why. I remember vividly fantasizing about removing my breasts when i began to develop and running freely, shirtless,  i remember being 8 and fantasizing about running around shirtless with no Boobs, with many tattoos and having body hair. I thought it was the coolest thing ever.

In middle school, A friend told me about being a transmasc, how alot of my body discomfort lines up with that. Of course, were in middle school so much of the advice i got from friends was misguided, i played with the idea. My mom let me dress up masculine and then shredded me in the car about how ridiculous I looked and again, blamed my father when he wasn't a thought in my head When I made the decision to explore this identity.
I was stubborn and kept trying but as i grew up, being reffered to as male exclusively began to wear me down and make me feel wrong. 
I felt out of place again and started wallowing in  femininity again, falling into a really deep depression through out the rest of high school, up until senior year when I discovered Punk rock, its aesthetics, fashion and music culture.

I was and still am so freed by this.
there is SO so little gender expectation in their fashion. I have a Mohawk now, I wear ripped straight jeans and flannels, the bagginess of the clothes coupled with my usually strong physic with make up makes me appear very gender ambiguous and I've heard older generations in stores question what I was, or look at me quizically. Its shot up my confidence.
 (I am still depressed but luckily its for other reasons lol)

I hope one day i can make my body match my mind. Ive contemplated taking testosterone in the future because I like the body hair i have and would like more. I want to live my 8 year old fantasy of running shirtless in a feild one day.

So I may be something like non binary or something similar I'm not completely sure. Like I like just being me not female or male just me. I think about having both a vagina and penis. Like the thought of having both feels kind of nice I'm not sure. Like I would kind of be more neutral by having both genetialia.

But I'm not sure I haven't heard of anything like this. So I don't know and I was talking to a non-binary person briefly though I didn't talk about the thought of have both at the same time just that I thought of having a penis sometimes and sometimes not liking my breast or possibly not liking them I'm not sure.

I can't talk to the person though anymore cause I have a lot of problems and struggles and they got overwhelmed by the little bit I shared and didn't handle the situation well at all since they just ignored me and had the student affairs office talk to me at my college and then a week later there was a no contact order between us.

I don't really reach out to people in a way that allows me to be vulnerable because of being afraid of being abbandoned so the situation wasn't good for me it was really detrimental to my mental health. They should have handled the situation differently instead of just ignoring everything like talk things out and if they were worried they could of had someone to mediate.

I would have backed off if they would have said so. Its hard to open up anyways and I'm used to always being along always in my room alone. Being out of place not being connected I've always felt a disconnect. And sense of not belonging of being out of place.

All my life I've hated myself. I was never a girly girl, though I tried so hard to be, because I thought I had to be. I was born a girl, I had to be a girl, and I was tomboyish and hated skirts and my long hair being down, so I was a *bad* girl. Even when I learned about trans people, my brain still said *that's okay for them, but you are not like that, you will never be a girl but you still need to try because that's ultimately who you are.*

For Halloween I always chose male characters to dress up as and felt so good doing it, and it wasn't a big deal because it was Halloween. Girls are allowed to wear ""male"" things like jeans and sweatshirts and hoodies, because they're for everyone, not just men.

And then I discovered being non-binary, and for a while, I thought that was right. I tried different labels under that umbrella like agender or genderfluid, demi-whatever. They were okay for a while, and then they weren't and I'd move on to something else.

Two years ago, I started feeling male, like exclusively. Nothing other than male, he/him, felt okay, to the point where a single, accidental slip would make me crash for days. I chose a new name, started going by he/him, and it felt super great; I was so comfortable in that identity that I even felt happy being a more ""feminine"" man, wearing softer colors and prints, wearing leggings and skirts over my binder.

But now I'm just confused again. Trenders aren't real, but I wonder if I am, still. Am I doing this because I think it's a way into a community and I really just want to feel included for once, a girl pushing into a space she doesn't belong in? Am I actually a trans man who just presents a little more femme? Am I non-binary in some way but desperate for a definite label because that's the only way to make sense of myself?

I have top and social dysphoria really badly-- I hate my breasts and I hate being called miss/ma'am-- and I hate having a uterus, a period. My bottom dysphoria waxes and wanes. Sometimes I'd really rather have a penis, but sometimes I don't mind having a vagina.

I love my new name, but I don't know if he/him is weird because it's wrong or because I'm just not used to it. Some aspects of T terrify me, but others I really won't mind.

84,2019-11-13 01:11:20,dvjzde,0,1,"Hey all,

My name is Jamie and I am fairly new to this sub. I've lurked around here a bit as I have started on my ""gender journey"" (as I refer to it). I've read a lot of posts on here with people asking questions about their gender identity and have loved reading through all of the supportive responses. I know that one day I'll be posting my own (I have so many questions!), but for my first post I wanted to share an amazing experience I had this past weekend.

Lately, as I have begun to really question my gender identity and see myself as more gender fluid, I've begun to go outside of my house dressed either fully feminine or incorporating more feminine aspects to my outfit. I went to my first pride festival fully dressed three weeks ago and have begun adding more feminine touches to my work attire (more jewelry, basic make-up). These experiences (especially pride) have given me more and more courage to express my feminine side more outside of the house. Well, Sunday, I decided that I wanted to go out fully dressed for a normal day of shopping and errands with my wife. So, my wife did my full make-up (I'm still working on my skills) and I wore a nice cowl neck sweater and skinny jeans. I decided against wearing my bra because my wife still isn't comfortable going that far yet unless we're going to a place that we know is a safe space. 

Despite some nervous moments (and some general shopping aggravation moments), it felt absolutely amazing!! There were several moments when we were in clothing stores that I couldn't stop looking in the mirrors. I felt so happy being able to express my feminine side so openly. It really cemented some things for me in my mind about my gender identity and who I am. It also made me feel like I can do this more often, which is something I've been wanting to do for so long. 

Anyways, I realize that I've started to ramble, but I just had to express how great this felt to people who I knew would understand.

Have a good rest of your day!

I’m not like other girls. It’s a cliche, overused phrase, but it holds true for me in particular. I have only met one other woman who had a beard, and it was not nearly as robust as mine. I inherited the body hair of my mother’s side of the family, so unless I am giving myself a daily wax there is no way to avoid looking like a werewolf. Thus, I am keeping my beard as an artistic expression of my nonbinary, trans self. 

Why should I have to change my body to be who I am? I used to beat myself up over not being the petite epitome of feminine - an I mean literally hitting myself because I’m an emotional roller coaster who hated myself. But, I have since learned to love who I am as I am. I am enough and I don’t need to radically change or even mutilate my body to express my innermost feminine feelings.

Of course, this sets me apart from society as a whole. Before I moved to Portland, I became the local spectacle in my hometown of Syracuse just for wearing a skirt. I feel a lot of healing has happened since moving to the west coast where I can reflect my identity in my choices much more freely without consequences. 

Still, I am odd. That’s a given, being that I am schizoaffective as well. It makes life a bizarre roller coaster in addition to dealing with my identity issues. I like to describe my condition as being bipolar but the aliens are abducting me to save me from the CIA which is trying desperately to create a reality TV show about my life. I am often in an eccentric self-generated narrative about what I am doing at any given moment. My purpose is always changing, as is how I am perceiving different events.

Naturally, you can expect that this adds a lot of pressure onto me for fitting in. And that’s the thing - I don’t. In a society that is so radically split into dichotomous us vs. them thinking, I proudly stand out against the even background. I am a dodecahedron in a world full of square and round holes. I don’t have many friends, but those I do have are true companions that I genuinely am grateful to have in my life.

I am homeless, but part of that is by choice. My entire experience spiralling onto the streets has been a radical transformative event, and I continue to seek authentic human experiences to expand my horizons. By regularly being forced outside my comfort zone, I have been actively reconditioned to be much freer than I once was. My perception of self has changed to the point where I don’t need any reassurance from other people to find solace with myself of my actions. I am as I am, and I am happy and grateful that I get to be me; an alien on my homeplanet.

Basically, what I’m trying to say is that you should believe in yourself and go confidently about your day. If I can survive in this world on the farthest fringe of the bell curve, then that is proof that it doesn’t matter who you are or what you look like. If I can find happiness in a world that has been designed for people that are in no way like me, then that is definitive proof that happiness is completely self-defined.

So, I'm afab, femme, I would otherwise call myself a woman, and I have no idea how to speak about an aspect of myself I'm learning about because I do not know ANYONE who feels this way.

My feelings about this kink? that I am explicating are tied into 1.) What I am sexually aroused by/fantasize about and 2.) Another thing I have no idea what the term for could be - a strong desire to have a penis without distress or disdain for not having one.

In an expansion of those two points:

1.) I am very attracted to traditionally feminine presenting people with larger-than-average clitorises or penises. It is the most attractive physical appearance, to me. I want my body to look like those bodies and the idea of that is sexually arousing for me. Not enough to get surgery/use medications or hormones/use devices such as a pump to alter the appearance of my parts, but I have a toy that I have used before to simulate having a penis (for both sex with another person and for masturbation) and that was SO arousing for me. Me picturing myself actually having a penis and actually having sex with someone else or masturbating, with special interest invested in my feminine presentation with having a penis. The porn I consume is amateur stuff by feminine presenting people with penises or larger than average clitorises almost exclusively.

2.) Not only am I interested in having a penis within the context of sex, but I'd like to have it throughout my day. I'd like to pack publicly and not because that turns me on. Nothing about the idea of ""secretly having a penis"" is arousing to me.  That's the part that makes me wonder if it's a gender identity thing as well as a kink thing or a ""lifestyle"" so to speak even. I'd like to wear something that simulates a flaccid penis in the day time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Do I feel dysphoric about not having a penis? Not at all. Do I feel like I have to do this to exist? Not at all. Is it something I want to be in a community to discuss this with other people or go out of my way to connect with others like this or dedicate a whole social media around (e.g. - a Tumblr or finding a hypothetical subreddit for or a Facebook group? Not at all.

And that's what makes it confusing to me. I'm queer and I'm femme and I have no interest in testosterone or dressing masculine or wanting to speak about this to people I meet with a label to identify me. That aspect of it confuses me. I'm not looking for community, I'm not looking for a surgical change or interested in manipulating my body to see more permanent changes or wanting this to be my existence outwardly nor always. Do I want to go on a Walmart run with a penis? Yes. Do I want to have sex with myself and others with a penis? Yes. Would I urinate with a penis? Yes. It's not even for sexual urination or public packing also. Just... I want to do that.

I want a penis most of the time almost like a natural part of my body. I don't feel incomplete without one. I don't want to transition to male or identify as masculine or any of that. I do, however, really want to know if there's a term for it.

I'm a cis bi man in my late 20s going through a couple of rough bumps in life all happening at once. I'm getting through it, but it's all brought up a bunch of interesting questions. I've always hated the socially imposed idea of being a man. How I'm supposed to act, think, dress, behave around others, etc. I'm Latin as well and have been surrounded by machismo my entire life. Masculinity, machismo, male ego ... It's all incredibly ... distasteful. I've been conflicted my whole life between the need to conform to that social pressure and the deep feeling that those traits are not who I am. One related shitty experience has really made me question this and myself a lot more. This is a kinda long story but hang in there.

I went to visit a friend who means a lot to me recently. We went out to some clubs and drank a ton. At one of these clubs we met up with one of their very drunk cis female friends (Who I'll just call Cindy). Cindy happened to bring along another Latin guy who oozed that machismo. My friend and I want to dance but Cindy hears that and takes me by force to dance with her. I'm drunk and just want to dance with my friend, which we always trade of who is the lead, twirl eachother, etc. After some dancing Cindy stops me and asks ""are you into guys or girls"" ...  I respond ""Both"" ... ""No wonder cause you can't lead for shit"". Cindy continued to subtly question my masculinity the rest of the night. Saying things like ""you're a man you should be strong and take charge"". Yeah gross. Forcibly trying to jam me into a box of what a man should be like. 

Later that night the macho dude said some gross sexual comments to my friends so. There was an altercation and the dude was forced out of the club. We moved on to another club , with Cindy drunkingly following. My friend tries to keep Cindy busy while I chill with the SO, we're all drunk at this point. I don't remember saying anything bad, and that doesn't sound like me, but at some point my friend notices something with the SO and runs over. I overhear them yelling ""What did he say, did he say something to you, just tell me ... He's just another guy like the rest of them"". 

That hurt. That hurt a lot. I had to run to the bathroom and basically have a panic attack (which never ever happens). No control at all, bouncing of the walls, fetal position, the works. I felt  a mix of rejection, disgust with myself and what I'm *supposed* to be, misunderstood, labeled, hurt, etc. I talked it out with my friend way later and they apologized. I don't in anyway hold it against them and fully understand where it comes from. That night was just really terrible ... And I never want that to happen again. I don't want to be in that box anymore. I want to avoid that label. I'm ok with the body I have I just hate what everyone else attaches to it.

I'm AFAB and usually feel and present as female, but lately I've started noticing that some days I'll wake up feeling more like a boy or somewhere in between. These feelings can also sometimes be triggered by my environment or external stimulus - like if I listen to certain music or put on a certain outfit, I'll feel more like a boy based on how that music makes me feel that day/week/whatever. I'm sure that sounds kind of stupid, but it's hard to explain. I've also noticed some things from my teenage years that may point to me being gender non-conforming but it's hard to know if these things are actually connected.

Sometimes the way I feel changes a couple times in a day, but usually it stays one way for a long time and then changes briefly for a day or two before switching back. Rinse/repeat. Mostly I just end up with a really strong urge to present a lot more towards a male/boyish style than I usually would.

I'm biologically female but I dont feel like I identify with one or the other. I'm pretty certain I'm under the non-binary umbrella somewhere and I'm just looking for some opinions. I've never liked terms that are female. Girl, woman etc. The word woman especially makes me extremely uncomfortable. I also dont like masculine terms either like boy or man. (Although saying boi as a joke will forever be funny to me) I like the idea of looking more androgynous, I cut my hair recently and I style it all kinds of ways that can make me look masculine feminine or in the middle too. I go back and forth with my style. I have pretty dresses, leather and Jean's as well as dress up shirts and pants. I know that sounds more gender fluid as I read this to myself but I dont feel as if I go back and forth. I dont identify being Male or female at all. I just feel I just am.

I just want to figure out what fits, so I can move on and continue to be myself. I dont like to stress on labels to much but just knowing what label fits is enough for me. So I can meet with people of a similar mindset and feel more of a sense of belonging.

Does someone have any idea what terms they think would fit? I know nobody can tell me what I am but at least give me some terms to read and think on. It's been a confusing last year or so since I realized I felt this way and I feel like I haven't made much progress on self discovery.

I'm looking for media made about (and hopefully BY) gender nonconforming AFAB people, especially if they identify as women or do not desire transition, but still exist outside of the gender binary. 

I say it this way because I see a lot of differences in opinion on what ""trans"" is, if NB are trans, etc. I want media regarding people who grew up labelled as ""girls,"" but who continue to experience gender differently than their more conforming peers, but who do not identify as men. This can be by GNC women, AFAB NB people, whatever. I just want some media that I can relate to, because it feels lonely out here for people like me. 

I don't really see myself as trans. I questioned it a lot, and still kind of feel ""agender,"" but I look around at a lot of NB communities and it doesn't seem like me either. I get mistaken for a boy often, especially when I keep my hair short (I used to get mistaken for a boy several times a week, but I'm growing out my hair now as I do periodically). I wear clothes from the boys section, though sometimes I like dresses. Pretty much no make up, ""masculine"" interests, largely male friend group, etc etc. I wear suits and oxfords to interviews. I've always dreamed about wearing a 3-piece suit for my wedding, but I will be marrying a man (I'm pan), so unfortunately it may never happen... Basically, I'm gender nonconforming enough for it to cause some problems in my life, but its so difficult to find people who relate without trying to convince me I'm trans. 

A lot of the media I watch now is focused on trans NB people who are transitioning or femme NB people, or trans men (who I most relate to, but again, I don't want to transition as I have 0% body dysphoria). I tried really hard to relate with a lot of the NB people I knew or saw online, but I feel like I present more like a trans man half the time  I also relate a lot to butch women, but alas, certain lesbian sects of the internet are unwelcoming to bisexuals, especially those actively dating men.

My name is Jessica Taylor and I am currently reading for my doctorate in counselling psychology with the University of West England. My email address is [Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk](mailto:Jessica6.Taylor@live.uwe.ac.uk) (for verification). I'm a (binary) transwoman and am looking to explore non-binary individuals experiences of their bodies. To this end I have obtained permission from the mods to post my survey [here](https://uwe.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1Tgy71QzzRx6eW1?fbclid=IwAR03ttpvsz_oygS0MC6SZNG24SDkm9ZdRuwjoQIJUwVBEp3z_y4YWj8cosU).

I have previously worked with the non-binary community to explore their experience of being non-binary (without the focus on their bodies), with this work being published in the *International Journal of Transgenderism* (a copy of which is available, upon request, to anyone over at my [researchgate page](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jessica_Taylor73)). This current research is aimed at getting more of a non-binary voice into the research on non-binary identity, so any interest would be welcome.

The survey itself is qualitative in nature - so it's all about the collection of rich descriptions (in other words, if you choose to complete it, write as much as you can muster!) and you don't have to complete it all in one sitting - you can come back to it anytime within a two week period. I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have, or to make any further amendments here if the mods feel them necessary.

I'm really looking forward to hearing from as many of you as possible.

Yeah, that didn't really last for long.

I'm gender-fluid, or at least i think i am. I say ""think"" because i clearly don't know what the fuck i am, and everytime i've tried to put a definitive label on myself i come out two weeks later and realize i'm not that either; this time i'm a lot more certain though. I mean, at least according to gender wiki, i'm a textbook case of genderfluidity. I wake up one day and feel perfectly fine and dandy in my regular ol' male body, i like my penis, my boyish charm and my voice, next day i feel this extreme, burning desire to shave every hair in my body, put on makeup and a dress and twirl around like an anime schoolgirl. I like to feel pretty, i like to look at myself in the mirror and feel like i look eye catching, i like the colors of the lipsticks i steal from my mom, i like my eyelashes to look long and thick, i love how the eye shadow makes my eyes pop and pierce people's souls... and then the next day I feel like a boy again, nothing out of place.

I started thinking about using a different name when i had my woman days, and i told my friends and they were really supportive and encouraging, buuuuuut...

They really don't get the chance to adress me with female pronouns or my other name, not when we're constantly surrounded with people who aren't privy to my secret. I don't really want to come out to my whole university (my country isn't exactly progressive... i'm scared that if everyone finds out i'll just be badgered by a bunch of people about what the fuck i am and i dont have the pacience to deal with that). Aside from that, i don't get to dress up that much... i still live with my parents and they're really catholic, really \*really\* catholic, so coming out to them is just... a can of worms that i'm not willing to open.

I don't have any safe space where i can dress up and be myself without having to hide in my bathroom just in case someone walks in and sees me as a woman and it's causing me some distress. I get this feeling in my chest, like the kind you get when you're really nervous, and my whole body feels warm, like the feeling you get right before you get goosebumps, and when i think about dressing up and presenting as a woman i get warmer and fuzzier, and i can't stop myself from cracking a smile like a dumbass (is this dysphoria? I can't tell). I want to present as a woman, i want people to call me by my new name and use female pronouns, i want to wear cute blouses and put on a coat of makeup to go to my university and i want people to see me and say ""Wow, there goes that girl."" And then i just go back to man-mode and nothing feels out of place.

The thing is, when i'm in woman-mode, presenting female is all i can think about. I study medicine, zoning out in class a couple of times isnt a bad thing, but zoning out \*all the time\* because i'm thinking about how i would look if i tried using earrings is really bad...

This is mostly just to vent about my whole experience, but if there was a Tl;DR to it i guess it would be that the way things are right now, i can't present myself as a female. Not without dealing with a lot of shit and possibly even getting into trouble with my university (it's a possibility, though i'm not sure how likely it is). I dont feel bad presenting male, i'm comfortable with it and don't want to stop doing it, I just wish i could present female with the same casualness i present male, because it's invading my brain and i have to find a way of calming this anxiety i get from not being able to show myself how i really am inside.",genderfluid,"Recently came out as GF and feel very anxious about some issues, help?",1573112001.0,"{'created_utc': 1573086801, 'id': 'dspgp2', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 4, 'selftext': 'It\'s been a couple of rocky months for me.

For Halloween he dressed as a witch with a dress and makeup, he asked me if he looked good and I told the truth saying the outfit looks really good and suits him, he asked if he looked sexy and I told the truth again and said it’s not my kind of thing but I’m sure other people would think he does.

He said he might (which means he won’t) and that the main thing he wants to talk to the counsellor about is problems in our relationship and doesn’t seem to think he has anything else to talk about.\nFor Halloween he dressed as a witch with a dress and makeup, he asked me if he looked good and I told the truth saying the outfit looks really good and suits him, he asked if he looked sexy and I told the truth again and said it’s not my kind of thing but I’m sure other people would think he does. This upset him and has made him think I don’t understand even more.\n\nWhy won’t he talk to me about this? How can I approach the subject?

I am a 31 year old male, living in a not very accepting place. Luckily for me, I am very comfortable with my masculinity. I love it in fact. I am a bodybuilder (and pretty good at it too), and strength athlete. I embrace, and love both of these things, and they are both things I am passionate about. 

This is not a compensation, or anything like that either. Growing up as a child, I always wanted to dress as a girl, play with dolls, wear makeup, etc. People always thought I was gay(well, still do haha), and dont understand that I really would rather do ""girl activities"" with the girls, than ""boy activities"" with the boys. This is still the case today. It took into my early twenties to really embrace, and enjoy aspects of my masculinity. Which I do, greatly. My genitals, my physicality, my intimate life with women. These are all things I cherish greatly(I dont know if that sounds dumb). 

Sorry, I'm jumping all over the place, but I want to just get my thoughts out as they come. Everyone has always thought I was gay. Even my parents. Everyone I try to talk to about any of these things goes there immediately, and is unconvincible otherwise. I absolutely believe that sexuality exists on a spectrum, dont get me wrong. I have lived an, unfortunately, promiscuous life. I have been sexually assaulted by both males, and female subjects, I have worked in the sex trade with both male and female clients, and I have had so many thousands of sexual experiences that I am fully comfortable, and without a doubt, able to say that I am not sexually attracted to masculine physicality, or masculine genitalia. 

I actually have a lot of trouble connecting with males in general, and can only really ever connect with females. This has been since childhood as well, as I did not connect with the masculine aspects of my father, and wanted to spend time with my mother instead. This leads me to so many problems, as I also struggle with boundaries(this is a separate issue, that I am taking steps to deal with), as my relationships with women often turn very inappropriate very fast, and before I know it... I'm now in a relationship with somebody I connected with because our genitals work together, and we are attracted to each other. Then they overlap, and coexist, and I break everyone's hearts, and just feel dead inside. I dont deserve any sympathy here, so dont think I ask for it. I often get labeled as a player, and people think I am compensating for my closeted homosexuality, when there is no compensation, or closeted homosexuality. Just seeking connection, and needing to understand boundaries. ANYWAY, forget this whole paragraph... that's not what this is about. 

I love physical beauty, and I love being ""beautiful"". I am not vain, and I have never, ever judged, or treated anybody in any different sort of a way based on their beauty that I perceive. I embrace my masculine beauty, and a little bit of the feminine side as well. 

The problem is, this feminine side of me feels so buried. I would not be accepted in my community, at my job, in my family, or in my personal relationships if I acted how I want to act. I dont even believe that my feminine side is in ""conflict"" with my masculine side. I want more of it, but I want to embrace my masculine side as well, and continue to develop it. I love wearing a tank top, rocking a couple days of stubble, shaving my head, throwing some boots on, and heading out the door. I will always do this, and enjoy it a lot. I will also always enjoy wearing a suit, and dressing in formal male clothing. 

I would also absolutely love to go get my makeup all done, nails done, body all shaved, high heels, wig, and just be comfortable like that. I have plans to try cross-dressing in the very near future. 

The thing is.. neither of those are my ideal expression. I dont want to go ""back and forth"". I dont want to wear dresses, skirts, bras, panties, etc... but I do want to wear girls pants and shirts, as well as male pants and shirts. While my choices would be mostly masculine, I want to be able to wear whichever I like, and with whatever I like. I want to wear eye makeup. I want to have my nails done. 

I want to embrace masculinity, and femininity fully. I dont even really know what I am asking anymore, or if any of this even makes sense. Please dont post anything inflammatory, as I dont think I will take it very well. I'm just trying to clarify my own identity a little bit I suppose.

I have been sexually assaulted by both males, and female subjects, I have worked in the sex trade with both male and female clients, and I have had so many thousands of sexual experiences that I am fully comfortable, and without a doubt, able to say that I am not sexually attracted to masculine physicality, or masculine genitalia. \n\nI actually have a lot of trouble connecting with males in general, and can only really ever connect with females. This has been since childhood as well, as I did not connect with the masculine aspects of my father, and wanted to spend time with my mother instead. This leads me to so many problems, as I also struggle with boundaries(this is a separate issue, that I am taking steps to deal with), as my relationships with women often turn very inappropriate very fast, and before I know it... I\'m now in a relationship with somebody I connected with because our genitals work together, and we are attracted to each other. Then they overlap, and coexist, and I break everyone\'s hearts, and just feel dead inside. I dont deserve any sympathy here, so dont think I ask for it. I often get labeled as a player, and people think I am compensating for my closeted homosexuality, when there is no compensation, or closeted homosexuality. Just seeking connection, and needing to understand boundaries. ANYWAY, forget this whole paragraph... that\'s not what this is about. \n\nI love physical beauty, and I love being ""beautiful"". I am not vain, and I have never, ever judged, or treated anybody in any different sort of a way based on their beauty that I perceive. I embrace my masculine beauty, and a little bit of the feminine side as well. \n\nThe problem is, this feminine side of me feels so buried. I would not be accepted in my community, at my job, in my family, or in my personal relationships if I acted how I want to act. I dont even believe that my feminine side is in ""conflict"" with my masculine side. I want more of it, but I want to embrace my masculine side as well, and continue to develop it. I love wearing a tank top, rocking a couple days of stubble, shaving my head, throwing some boots on, and heading out the door. I will always do this, and enjoy it a lot. I will also always enjoy wearing a suit, and dressing in formal male clothing. \n\nI would also absolutely love to go get my makeup all done, nails done, body all shaved, high heels, wig, and just be comfortable like that. I have plans to try cross-dressing in the very near future. \n\nThe thing is.. neither of those are my ideal expression. I dont want to go ""back and forth"". I dont want to wear dresses, skirts, bras, panties, etc... but I do want to wear girls pants and shirts, as well as male pants and shirts. While my choices would be mostly masculine, I want to be able to wear whichever I like, and with whatever I like. I want to wear eye makeup. I want to have my nails done. \n\nI want to embrace masculinity, and femininity fully. I dont even really know what I am asking anymore, or if any of this even makes sense. Please dont post anything inflammatory, as I dont think I will take it very well. I\'m just trying to clarify my own identity a little bit I suppose.\n\nThanks for reading, and I\'m very sorry if this is not an appropriate place to post this.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Struggling with identity', 'created': 1573411909.0}"
104,2019-11-10 12:15:55,duaqok,2,1,"I've been having a fun ride on the gender rollercoaster for a while now. I'm AMAB, and a couple years ago, my shell started to crack, mostly thanks to the lovely people of subreddits like /r/egg_irl or /r/traa. That kicked off a period of four or so months when transitioning was all I could think about. I would swing from intense optimism thinking about the possibilities to intense pessimism thinking of just how impossible it all seemed. I was in a foreign country that wasn't exactly enlightened about trans issues, I didn't speak the language, and I didn't really have any native contacts I felt like I could approach about this. So, I just kind of played it off as best I could, and eventually those feelings cooled. 

This left me in a bit of a lurch as far as my identity went. I still called myself a trans woman, but I no longer really wanted to put myself through the struggles of transitioning. A little voice in the back of my head whispered ""maybe you're just a cis guy after all"".

I didn't like that voice. I still don't really like that voice. I'm not sure why. Up until that first bout of gender fuckery, I'd never really experienced any real distress over gender before. I had never really taken any real joy in being a boy before that either, mind. I took a quiet, secret pride in things that set me apart from a stereotypical guy, but it had never been a crisis of identity for me before. 

So, when I did have that first crisis of gender identity, it threw me for a loop. I had no strong feelings tying me to malehood, so it wasn't a huge issue for me to cut ties with it, at least as far as my own thoughts went. When those feelings of euphoria over the idea of being a woman started to fade, I still didnt have any feelings of euphoria over being a guy to replace it. Being a guy was just ""fine"". It was easier than being a woman, easier than transitioning. All of that was hard and painful and certain to make things difficult to impossible for me. Being a guy, on the other hand, was just existing. It was just the status quo. 

So, I just occupied this space mentally for the rest of the year. This weird dysphoric/euphoric phase was the first time I had ever felt strongly about my gender, so I still thought of myself as a trans woman, but I had no desire to transitioning, and I was okay with that. I wasn't thrilled about it, but I was okay with it. 

And then it happened all over again, almost a year to the day of my first big gender crisis. I was trans and I wanted to transition so much. My actual living situation hadn't changed, so I was still crippled in terms of what I could actually do to act on these feelings, but, oh lords, the feelings were back. 

Once again, I spent months obsessing over my gender. I made plans, I even came out to a few people who I knew would be supportive. 

And then the feelings faded again. It was around this point I first really thought ""maybe I'm genderfluid"". I had always been sympathetic to the idea that gender wasn't static and that it would probably shift for a lot of people over the course of their lives, but it had never been something I thought would apply to me. 

Honestly, I didnt want it to apply to me. At that time, I found the thought of granting validity to this alleged male side of me distasteful. I didn't want to be male some of the time. I wanted to be a woman. At least, that was my emotional reaction when I tried to reason out my weird gender yo-yo-ing. A little later, I found the term genderflux, and I picked that up for a while. 

I liked the idea of being genderflux a lot more. It gave me a term to describe these weird fluctuations without actually having to say ""I'm a guy"" at all. But I still wasn't sure if it fit perfectly. I felt apathetic during these periods of lull in my gender crises. I didn't feel like the whole concept of gender rubbed against me the wrong way, I just didn't feel strongly about gender at all. I remembered feeling strongly about being a woman, but i just had nothing in the moment. 

But, genderflux was the label I carried, loosely, until like two days ago. I'm currently in one of my weird apathetic moods, after some yo-yo-ing around. I just had this thought of ""I'm a guy right now, and that's okay."" And it was okay. It felt like acknowledging a truth I hadn't wanted to acknowledge up until now. My previous reluctance to think of myself as genderfluid wasn't there. It was actually a bit of a relief, honestly, to be able to address myself during my time of apathy without feeling vaguely guilty over it.

So, here I sit now, typing this all out. This wasn't really the post I meant to type. I just wanted to give a little bit of background before asking when you k.ew you were gender fluid, but you got this whole essay anyways. 

Writing this out, I'm still not really sure where exactly I would place myself. There's definitely some level of genderflux going on, but I'm still not sure how sort my own feelings out. Are the times when I'm not in crisis just normal agender times, or is it just me actually being a guy and returning to the status quo. If I'm fine (in an apathetic sense) with living as a guy, is that just some weak agender mood, or is that just a status quo being a guy thing? Honestly, I have no clue, and writing all this mess out just muddled it more for me.

So, I'm hoping some of your own stories might help me find my own way. When did you know you were genderfluid? What does it feel like if you're in a mindset of your AGAB? If you're genderflux or agender, what does that feel like?

I’ve worn a few dresses and I’ve liked some of them but it depends very much on the style. 

Anyways this weekend I was up till like 3 am pondering life’s great questions. It was an anxious but honestly also positive experience, it was odd. Many thoughts crashing into each other in a way that would normally overwhelm me, but it was euphoric this time. 

I was at a con this weekend and I talked to my girlfriend about this and she’s so sweet that she bought me a lemon quartz necklace I’d been eyeing. It’s great because it’s not too flashy so I’m comfortable wearing it in public but it also expresses my feminine side in a way I know but not necessarily everyone needs to know. 

During my epiphany I also came to the conclusion that I’m Pan. I’ve always been “pan-curious,” but I’ve been very worried that people will gate-keep me because I haven’t ever been with anyone other than one identifying as female. I am attracted to other sexes and often crave them romantically as well as sexually.

I’ve been trying to have a sort of soft coming-out because, while I have a fair amount of support, I am also very anxious people will gate-keep and invalidate my experience.

Many thoughts crashing into each other in a way that would normally overwhelm me, but it was euphoric this time. \n\nI was at a con this weekend and I talked to my girlfriend about this and she’s so sweet that she bought me a lemon quartz necklace I’d been eyeing. It’s great because it’s not too flashy so I’m comfortable wearing it in public but it also expresses my feminine side in a way I know but not necessarily everyone needs to know. \n\nDuring my epiphany I also came to the conclusion that I’m Pan. I’ve always been “pan-curious,” but I’ve been very worried that people will gate-keep me because I haven’t ever been with anyone other than one identifying as female. I am attracted to other sexes and often crave them romantically as well as sexually.\n\nI’ve been trying to have a sort of soft coming-out because, while I have a fair amount of support, I am also very anxious people will gate-keep and invalidate my experience.\n\nAnyways, it’s just nice to feel free. I feel like I’ve gotten into touch with a part of myself that has been missing. I am very glad I’m not the only one experiencing this.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Talking about my experience realizing I am gender-fluid I think?', 'created': 1573614050.0}"

133,2019-11-13 05:02:20,dvmqzh,2,1,"So, my favorite part of dressing feminine is painting my toes and wearing cute shoes. It just makes me feel cute and like myself.

My first girlfriend (my ex-ex) way back in high school was super into nail polish; it was her and her mom's hobby. They had hundreds of bottles and she always had a different color/design every week. She also LOVED shoes. For graduation her mom got her a pair of Valentinos and she just about died lol. 

We used to be best friends, we told each other a lot of personal things even after we'd broken up. We still are kinda, but now that we go to separarte colleges, and as most people will find in their own lives, are finding it difficult to keep in touch at the same level that we used to. 

In our conversations she's mentioned one of her close friends, we'll call him ""D,"" and he's very openly gay, which makes me feel like she'd like be more cool with finding out that I'm actually very feminine.

At the same time, it's SO out of character compared to how she remembers me that I'm slightly worried that she might tell maybe 1 or 2 friends, which might lead to a chain reaction of people knowing. I'm not sure I'd wanna have this conversation with some people.

The reason I wanna tell her is because really soon I'll have an opportunity to go to an event that's nail polish related, but I don't want to go alone. I KNOW she'd find it fun/cool. But also if I just invited her without any context, she'd obviously find it strange that I was inviting her to do something nail polish related.

I am looking for diverse individuals to complete an online IRB approved survey that will take approximately 15 to 20-minutes. To be included in the study, you must be at least 18 years of age, possess English proficiency, and be living in the United States. The survey has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB; STUDY00144682) at the University of Kansas.

The current study is a part of my dissertation research, which examines the relationship between multiple diverse identities and help-seeking intentions for mental health concerns. The study possesses minimal risk and has the opportunity to directly benefit you by obtaining mental health and mental health service resources provided at the end of the online survey. Further, we believe that the information obtained from this study will help us gain a better understanding of how diverse groups perceive and intend to seek mental health services.

The survey is available at the link below:

191,2019-11-19 19:36:40,dypfsm,10,2,"Hey y'all,

I've been running into a relationship conflict, and I was wondering if anyone else in the community here had any similar experiences or advice. I'm AFAB and currently identify as genderfluid, and I definitely have fluctuations in my attitudes, pronouns, and presentation. I've been very happy with coming to accept my gender identity, but the problem is that my long-term boyfriend is only really attracted to me when I'm in femme moods. 

While my femme moods do happen frequently, I just find myself feeling sad that my straight partner isn't attracted to me when I'm in non-binary or masc territory. I thought this would be fine so long as my partner still really valued me as a person during these times, but I'm worried that it won't be enough. It's true that attraction comes and goes in relationships over time, but for some reason this feels different to me.

Has anyone here had similar experiences? How did things work out for you? Obviously the circumstances are a bit different in each relationship, but I'd still like to hear from y'all.

Thanks awesome people,
