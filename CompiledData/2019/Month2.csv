Flash forward to later that day when one of the kids in her class came running up to my dad in the parking lot as he was picking the kids up and asked ""is it true that your daughter is neutral?"" 

Thats when the youngest of my siblings, an 8 y/o, responded ""THEYRE NOT NEUTERED MY SIBLING ISNT A DOG"" 🤣 

My dad had to gently tell my sister that neuter was different from neutral, then tell the kid that I'm a sibling not a daughter.

Please don't read if this will trigger, discomfort or otherwise upset you.** If you can't read below that's entirely valid and I hope you have a nice night!

Let me describe who I am as a disclaimer for my experiences: I am an AMAB, agender, 'white working class' 21 year old. I am a victim of sexual assault (both recent and from childhood) and the victim of abuse at the hands of three individual trans men. I understand my experiences are not entirely unique, and that I benefit vastly from appearing as a ""guy"" in my day-to-day life (much more so from being a white one) but I have suffered greatly from it. In my personal life I have been actively discouraged from defending myself in abusive situations at the hands of a trans man, I have been told that because of my assigned gender my consent is a ""grey area"". I have been told that if an abuser is hitting me and spitting in my face and I hit him back and leave the room that makes me the abuser. I have been gaslighted (gaslit?? jfc what is the past tense of this), manipulated and intentionally triggered and because of my stature those facts have been ignored and my reactions have been scrutinised. 

I have been permanently discouraged from existing in NB spaces for appearing too masculine, not intentionally but just because I like to wear what's comfortable. I have been excluded from social situations *exclusively for being AMAB*. When I wake up and get on Reddit and see an entire post being upvoted into the stratosphere about how we need to discuss abuse against trans men I say ""Oh okay! This should be productive."" and despite my history I feel 0 discomfort in opening the post hoping to see abuse statistics being discussed critically. Personally I think all statistics should be held under the absolute harshest gaze and picked apart, statistics aren't just numbers and the sociopolitical factors deciding the numbers portion of abuse statistics are more important than the numbers themselves. So when I see people saying ""Trans men need to be considered and cared for in reports of abuse against trans people"" and that the social factors of their perceived benefits rely on them being on HRT, passing, hetero presenting etc, I go ""Yes good this is what I wanted"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Then when I scroll down and all I see are men demanding to be the *only* attended to party in articles, and I see them *demanding* attention, and I see them talking about how they *deserve* to be completely separated from the abuse statistics all trans people face. And then I see someone mention wanting to see more NB representation in those statistics just to be piled on by some asshole talking about how ""CAN'T TRANS MEN JUST HAVE AN ENTIRE ARTICLE TO THEMSELVES"" I am fucking ***baffled***. Why is ANYBODY deserving of having their abuse paid attention to more than anyone else?? What puts anybody in the position to say they deserve an entire article dedicated to them within the umbrella of abuse that trans people face? This is fucking mindboggling but it's also *infuriating*. The sheer resentment you must feel towards anyone that isn't exactly like you to respond to ""I'd like to see other groups besides trans women represented as well more often"" by accusing that person of *derailing the topic* is borderline xenophobic. It's hating the *other*, it's hating the people who aren't like *you*. 

I can't fucking believe that there is such a distinct lack of solidarity in so many queer spaces, that gatekeeping and the need for sameness is so fucking pervasive that we would happily accuse equally marginalised groups of ""derailing topics"" by wanting to be seen. I absolutely cannot believe that and it reeks of the exact MRA bullshit that cishet 'redpillers' do all the fucking time. At a certain point you aren't interested in having your issues paid attention to, you're focused on having you *identity* paid attention to. You're demanding an excess of space and attention in a capacity that other groups are even more excluded from. That's nothing but hubris--it's pride and it's selfishness. More importantly it's anything but productive, and that NB people have to struggle so fucking greatly for any attention or respect in general let alone from ***other trans people*** is revolting. Nobody. **Nobody** is above being abused. And nobody's abuse is less valid or important than anyone else's. That people are incapable of seeing the struggle they share with one another is the most genuinely demoralising experience I've had recently and it shows me that we're still so far from establishing mutual respect among all trans identities.

Secondly, aside from wearing a pronoun button (which I will be doing, they/them), do any of you have experience avoiding being misgendered in Disney specifically ? If I have to write my title anywhere, is there the Mx. option?

I’m not interested in the characters, so avoiding being called stuff like ‘princess’ etc. should be easy? But I’m still also looking for gender neutral alternatives to anything I might be called while there.

136,2019-02-04 19:32:57,an5aoy,5,1,"The past week, I've been thinking about my gender a lot, reflecting on how I've talked about it over time, and I'm wondering if I may be more agender than previously identified.

My whole life, my gender has just been a reflection of other people's expectations based on my physical characteristics, a path of least resistance most of the time, except when I get hurt or helpless or angry and fight it. I ended up female by default, and I'm okay with it, because it's what I know, but I also don't feel like it's MINE. I've always wanted my gender to be irrelevant, and I thought for a long time that was simply due to misogyny and toxic gender roles, but now I'm wondering if maybe it's more than that or ... less.

My sister has three kids, 2 AFAB and 1 AMAB, and one of the most important things in my life is stripping out as much of the toxic, backwards ideas they get about gender from media (and my mother) as possible. They see that Auntie is physically strong, financially independent, fun as hell, and unlimited. In their eyes, I'm a woman, and that's okay; I think I add more value to their development that way, at least for now. To my heterosexual boyfriend, I'm a girlfriend, and that's okay; it doesn't bother me to be that, because it's just a label that doesn't inform our dynamic at all. Being a sister is also okay with me. Being a daughter is ... less okay, now that I think about it, because the gender damage that was done to me was done during my development at the hands of my mother (my father, who was my primary caregiver for the vast majority of my childhood, has always been wonderful, and I armchair read him as asexual/aromantic, and I don't think he would have parented an AMAB child much differently).

My gender isn't important to me, but if it's important to someone else *for reasons that don't hurt me*, I can be a woman for them without discomfort. I could not similarly be a man, because that's NOT familiar to me, I don't identify with it in any way, and it would feel disingenuous and appropriative. My gender is still, I guess, to this day something that belongs primarily to or is informed by the people around me. I use female pronouns because I always have, they don't bother me, and they're easy. Depending on the day and the form, I'll either tick the female box or the prefer not to say box. I live my life presenting female and IDing as a woman, but if you ask me my gender, the feeling I get deep down inside is: don't know, don't care, question irrelevant, what's it to you, let's please move on and talk about why Deep Space Nine is the best Star Trek.

Still, there are days that I cling vehemently to my woman identity because I've suffered from misogyny all my life, so I feel like I've earned the right to be a woman and speak for women, regardless of my gender, and ... that's kind of a weird thing to wrap my head around. Is an agender woman even a thing? I guess if it's what I am, then it is a thing, right? Somehow in my head I've separated being a woman from being gender: female, and like .... ?????

I am very open to dialogue here, and that's ultimately why I'm posting this publicly rather than just sticking it in a journal. I'm sure I have lots of blind spots, and I'm uncomfortably aware of how consistent this idea of wearing an identity for others is with the way girls are socialized, and how consistent it also is with my own C-PTSD. I'm certainly gender-apathetic, but from there, I'm still ... half questioning and half wondering what the point is in questioning if I don't care about the answer. What I can say after a lot of noodling is that I  have never experienced any kind of gender euphoria, and no pronouns have ever felt exciting or worth the hassle of replacing she/her, which are inoffensive to me/fine enough.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a question:  What differentiates nonbinary gender dysphoria from normal trans people?  For example, I dislike every aspect of maleness in my body, wrong genitals, I want to completely pass as female, I want a female voice.  Socially, I don't really care about whether I'm treated as a woman so long as I'm not treated as a man.  If people want to consider me some 3d gender, I couldn't care less just so long as that gender is not some kind of transmasculine or male gender.  I never really got offended by the ""Transwoman are Transwoman"" transrational  narratives.  Only if they make me out to be a man would I object.  Though I am in the minority as a lot of trans woman would hold a very strong view of wanting to be labeled as a woman and would object to being a 3d gender.

&amp;#x200B;

Transmen experience the 180 degree reverse of what I experience.

However I never questioned my gender identity, mainly because I didn't even know that was a thing back then. I briefly experimented with male presentation, but quickly stopped when a friend said, ""you're not a boy, teatfairy!!"" So thus began a LONG period of trying to be feminine. I sorta took it to the extreme and tried to be very fem. Literally just doing things because they were feminine, not necessarily because I enjoyed it. 

While in school, in a sociology class, we were asked to make a list of things we would do if we woke up as the opposite sex the next day. I completely drew a blank, every other female in the class quickly had a list and many were giggling at the absolute absurdity of being the opposite sex, but I was like, ""I would do every thing I'd normally do except I'd have a penis?"" This lead me to do a lot of soul searching. I realized that I have NEVER felt female and the concept of feeling like a female was alien to me. It hit me like a ton of bricks and once I got over the initial shock it was like a weight was lifted. My sister in-law gave me some awesome information about being nb/agender, etc. 

My boyfriend shaved his eyebrows off and told me he prefers it that way, I don't necessarily enjoy the look but he's a wonderful human and I actually adjusted to it a lot easier than I thought. I say this because I told him I was going to stop shaving my armpits because of it, he was like, ""cool, whatever."" Then as the hair got thicker and thicker I felt so... Me! I felt 10x more comfortable with hairy armpits. Its something that helped me a lot in this kind of up and down period I'm in, I never thought my armpit hair would be so beneficial lol.

So I want to know how your dysphoria relates to your gender (you obviously don't have to answer that question, but I have other questions, so hold on tight). For me, I notice that I might have dysphoria.

I don't think there's anything wrong with being a girl. I think it's pretty nice being a girl! Relatively less restrictions on what you can wear, and you can act certain ways without getting in social trouble for it, I guess.
But the thing is, I'm so uncomfortable with my body. And it's not in a, *I wish I wasn't fat* kind of way, it's in a ***I don't want my body to be able to do certain things, and those things are because I am female***.

I'm kind of uncomfortable talking about specifics, but I'll say one just to explain...
Basically, I hate the fact that people can see my chest and not see a *chest*, if you know what I mean. I have a chest, but it's under some thing caused by me being female.

Another is the fact that I can reproduce. AKA, have children. That thought is so grotesque to me. It is disgusting. I don't think having children is disgusting, but if I ever got pregnant, **I would kill myself**. It is not something that I would ever want. It is not something I should be able to do. If I could choose not to have that ability, I would erase it in a heartbeat. Although I'm not saying I'd rather be the one impregnating.

I'm afraid I'll be unnatractive. And feel insecure.

I've talked about it since July last year how I've wanted to cut my hair short again. When I had it short, I had to worry less about my hair and could focus on other things more. I felt less dysphoric and more confident. I took more pictures of myself and found myself attractive. I looked more lively.

I cried nonstop when I cut my hair last time, as my (ex)assistant manager laughed at me when I came in the next day with my hair short. I... I don't know. It really scares me.

Something that made you feel super validated and happy, anythign short will do! It will be for my next compilation available on theaters (YouTube) ! I'm a trans girl that makes meme compilations of transgender stuff (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU9HRNNj9VY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU9HRNNj9VY)) and at the end of each one I add not a meme but a short story about validating stories we have had! Since the first three were already mtf stories and the last one a compilation of ftm stories I thought I could add a story about NBs too! I usually get this from subs like [r/mtf](https://www.reddit.com/r/mtf), but here the dynamic is all different, and the top posts page is filled with just selfies, so I thought that maybe we could make of this thread a thread for you to share me the stories that have made you smile!

We are excited to celebrate our special day with you and in order to ensure that we have the most comfortable and enjoyable day possible we sincerely express the necessity of the following:
We request the general use of gender neutral terminology when referring to those involved in and attending the wedding. Some examples of gender neutral greetings and reference are; Folks, Friend(s), Everyone, Guest(s), Wedding Party, Best Person/People &amp; Etc. 
In specific we will NOT be using ANY gendered terms when referencing NAME, this includes the use of “Groom/Bride”, “Husband/Wife” &amp; Etc. A straightforward means to ensure these terms are not used would be to simply refer to NAME by their name. Some examples of welcomed terms are; Fiancé(s), Spouse(s), Partner(s), Newlywed(s) &amp; even simply “The Happy Couple”. 
We will require ALL guests to wear Pronoun markers throughout the celebration; which will be provided in the form of stickers upon entrance to the venue. 
The washrooms WILL be 100% gender neutral and are not single occupancy. This means that ALL guests will be welcome in ANY restroom. 
We understand those new to these concerns may require time to adjust. Be assured that mistakes will not be criticized as attempts and genuine respect is appreciated. That being said we wish to ensure this important day is enjoyed by all of our guests and most importantly by us. Thus it is with sadness that we must request those whom are unable, at a minimum attempt, to observe the above to regretfully decline this invitation. Any guests who choose to attend and are observed to be malicious or discourteous in retort to any of these points will be asked to leave. We sincerely hope you are able to attend and regret any apprehension these key points may evoke.

I figured it out by thinking I was ftm and having a... suboptimal coming out experience. My parents were supportive, but my mom specifically said “I don’t think you are”. I get why now, because I wasn’t, but it broke my heart. Cue therapy and research and my therapist giving me cards of traits/adjectives that she made me sort into male or female. It turned into a huge continuum where, overwhelmingly, most of the (many) cards where in the middle. 

It made a hell of a lot of sense considering that I had spent three years questioning, trying out pronouns and nonbinary genders before settling on ftm, which never felt right.

275,2019-02-08 12:02:56,aofv2j,0,1,"Heyo this is my story about transexperiences pronouns and names! I wanted to share it to see if some is feelin' me. It's long, so it's a bit of a rant, sorry! 

Since I've been a kid I've been having transexperiences, as in I've been ""forgetting"" that I'm a female. I could think about my future and see myself as an old man, or, in a nearer future, a boy. Then i woke up from the daydreaming and basically thought ""hmm... Right, I'm a female. Strange thoughts"". I was never that bothered with it, i just thought it was odd and decided not to tell ppl so that they couldn't make a big deal out of it. Back then the termnonbinary was not a thing, and i knew about transmen. I wondered if I was a transboy but shoved the thought aside, bc the narrative ""I was born in the wrong body"" (Wich was the only narrative I ever heard about transfolks) didn't click with me. For me, this is not the wrong body, it is my body, but I have just never been very attached to it! 

Then puberty happened and I found my body grotesque, but I didn't mind still. As I said, I didn't feel very attached to my body. I remember feeling weirded out by it in the bathtub, when I was with it in a way I never was otherwise, but on other occasions I was neglecting it, keeping my head in theclouds.  I still don't know if it was (and to a lesser extent still is) dysphoria/fatophobia/a general disgust of the human body/ a mix. This alienation of my body still occurs to me on the rare occasions I'm taking a bath. (I'm not disgusting, I shower.) And the even rarer occasions when I am being intimate with someone! 

I am definitely nonbinary. I was at a camp 1.5 years ago when the egg cracked. But the realisation was more of a ""okey, so I'm nonbinary. So what?"" And I kept on living my life presenting as a woman. If somebody would ask, I wouldnt deny that I'm nonbinary, and I did tell a few when it was suitable for the conversation, but I didn't wanna make a fuss about it. I did have a fight with my sister about her viewing as a woman when I was drunk once but that's about how intense it ever got.

Then a transperson I know told me; ""I thought I was asexual but really it was just dysphoria haha""and I felt like it hit something vital. After that I went home and ordered an agender t-shirt that I wear to this day. I started to discuss friwnds and family about that we should all use gender neutral pronouns as a default always. I didn't want to ask ppl to do it specifically for me, I wanted it to be the norm. I realised ppl wouldn't probably start a revolution with me, but seeing how passionate I was about it, referring ppl best I could with gender neutral pronouns,and a top of that wearing my agender t-shirt, at least maybe someone would start referring me the same without me having to tell them how to use language with me. I do not want to tell ppl how to use language with me, I just want things to float. 

But ppl did not catch on. After europride this we I told my to stop using such gendered  language about me. Then, a couple of weeks later, I was out sailing with my sister and friends, and I had a breakdown where I just cried about pronouns and gender to my sister and her sambo. Still I explicitly didn't tell them to use gender neutral pronouns, I just cried about me being an alien and not getting gender. They still didn't catch on. A week later I explicitly told them in their appartment that I want them to use gender neutral pronouns with me. After that I kept telling ppl.

But I knew there was gonna meet problems, Wich is why I didn't want to bother in the first place; when being met in other linguistical spheres that has a more binary language I would have to choose. A top of that my uncle, that calls me she bc they do not recognize gender neutral pronouns in their vocabulary, tells me that they don't go around meeting new people saying ""hey my name is x and my pronouns is he"" (we have the kind of relationship where I call them them tho they use he bc they call me she tho I prefer they). For me, that likes to let things float, it is good that they behave like this, bc I do need to find a way to relate to that fact.

So what I did was crafting a new name for myself, one that wouldnt make ppl assume, one that would make ppl wonder as soon as I've said my name. 

When I finally, this winter, settled with something I was happy with, I was euphoric. The ppl I interact with daily now  use it for me. But I do miss my old name as well. It was feminine, but I didnt mind that per ce, it was my name , and I had my own relationship to it. Now I feel like I  have to choose. My new name clearly fills a practical function my old name didn't, and I love it. But my old name I do not want to let go of, for I love it as well. I am starting to think of going name poly; presenting as new name but still recognizing my old name. Idk. It'll come to me. 

My grandma says I should let it be. They are a lot like me, and I feel them, but I also feel  as we can't always let things be, or we'll stagnate. But now, I think it is time for me to finally follow their advice for a while.

I used to be fairly certain that I wanted top surgery. In my early-to-mid 20's, it was one of my main goals. I've also considered going on testosterone off and on, and have experimented with presenting as male. However, it's pretty much impossible for me to pass as male without being on T, and trying to present as male is stressful, honestly. I don't like binding my chest because it's uncomfortable and makes me extra aware of and self-conscious about my chest. I don't like how hard it is to find men's clothes that fit me. And I don't always mind how women's clothes fit me, as long as they're not extremely feminine. When I spend time with transmasculine people who are transitioning, I feel self-conscious sometimes because they're a lot more manly than I am. I don't know how to tell the difference between signs that transitioning isn't right for me and general frustration with the process. Like, if I felt great when I bind my chest, that would be a great sign that having top surgery is the right move. Since I don't like binding, it's harder for me to feel certain about things like that.

Meanwhile, as I've gotten older, I have found that my dysphoria has mellowed out some. I can look in the mirror and kind of like how my breasts look, for example.

Honestly, I'm really scared to lose that. But I still feel kind of disconnected from it all. Like, I can appreciate my body, but I don't know if I feel at home in it. I guess I feel a little like a character in a story who gets magically transformed or something and can't change back. It's not terrible, and maybe I can be happy like this, but it doesn't always feel like ""me."" I worry sometimes that I'm just lying to myself because transitioning is daunting and complicated. I still get jealous sometimes when I encounter someone who has transitioned, and I still get dysphoric sometimes when I see a man I wish I resembled more or could dress like.

387,2019-02-11 05:47:35,apd5nz,7,1,"My child (14yrs)  was born female, and came out this year as non-binary. We are a super supportive household, and so they are able to dress how they want, have the haircut they want, etc. They are also out at school, and we have instructed teachers to use gender neutral pronouns, respect my child, etc. We are also going to meet with a pediatric trans specialist very soon. Now, on to the exciting (and terrifying) stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

My child has had a crush on a boy for a VERY long time. They were talking the other night, my child expressed feelings, and he said he liked her back and they decided to go out. Aside from him not knowing what to refer to my child as (they don't want girlfriend or boyfriend or anything, so for now they are using ""accomplice,"" which I think is hilarious), I am nervous what this means. It's scary enough for your kids to begin dating anyhow, this is a whole area I'm unprepared for. 

&amp;#x200B;

Additionally, this boy's family are VERY anti-LGBTQ, and even threw a fit when they first found out my kid was NB (our kids are in an extremely small school/homeschool group, and they have been friends/best friends for a few years). The boy seems totally fine with everything, uses neutral pronouns, etc., and the kids at school are in general pretty cool. But this is just really scary. For now, they are keeping it a secret from his parents. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole thing feels like a bunch of small bombs that could go off at any time, and I don't want my kid to get hurt. I love them desperately. And this boy is one of my students (I teach one of their high school classes) and I am very fond of him also. What are things I can do as a parent to support my child as they navigate this very new territory? Also, is there anything I should be prepared for, or help my child prepare for?

402,2019-02-11 20:09:41,apkdu5,8,1,"I tried posting this on /r/genderqueer but it got removed and I don't know why... so I guess I'll try here? Sorry this is long af; the last two paragraphs could probably work as a tldr lol.   

So I'm afab. But a lot of things have led me to start questioning my gender. And I'm just confused and I don't know if I'm just a super masculine/butch cis girl, or agender, or a demigirl, or genderfluid, or what. I'm also autistic and I know dysphoria

I guess my first instances with gender were when I was super young, like 3-4 years old. At preschool, during recess, they would often play boy vs girl games. And half the time I'd go to the boy's side (I think at one point I'd even made a schedule -- Mondays and Wednesdays were boy days, and Fridays were girl days lol).

My parents were, I'm guessing starting that age up until I was about 13, very against ""girly"" things. They said anything ""girly"" was stupid -- makeup, fashion, dolls, etc. (when I turned 13 or so, they started expecting me to be more girly, but i never did)

Despite this, during elementary school, a lot of my friends were girls. And I remember being fairly interested in dolls and even somewhat in makeup during that time.

Then I guess things started to change? I'm not very sure on the specifics.

When my mother first said I needed to wear a bra, I cried. At the time I think it was because I didn't want to grow up. But ever since then (I'm 19 now), I've layered up on top to avoid having to wear one, and to avoid people seeing that I have them. They're not even that big lol they're tiny af. Even in the hottest days of summer, I wear a big sweatshirt. I just want them gone. I don't even like saying the words lol. Anything tight I just won't wear. Last semester I had to wear a dress for something that was pretty tight, so I bought some training bras and now I wear those every time I can't wear a baggy sweatshirt. They're so tight but they work. It's still not enough tho... I had my arms in some pretty weird positions to try to cover the chest stuff lol.

I've always hated dresses and skirts. They feel so wrong. But I'm autistic and have sensory issues, and any pants other than sweatpants are torture, so I've just learned to suffer being super uncomfortable while wearing skirts and dresses.

I've also recently (and I think before a little, but I gained some weight so it wasn't as obvious) had problems with my thighs and hips and butt. Theyr'e just huge lol. I hate them. (I have a lot of problems eating too, because I just want to make myself as little like a girl as possible).

I've always been more masculine, and I don't really care about gender roles. In fact, I kinda take pride in smashing them lol. I like being ""that girl who smashes gender roles and acts like a dude"".

I cut my hair super short about a year ago after years of wanting it short, and it felt soooo much better. And now, people assume I'm a boy (usually a super young one, but whatever). I kinda like that too tho? I like when people misgender me lol. But thne I also like people seeing me as a girl.

Being called a ""woman"" or ""lady"" also makes me cringe so hard. I hate it.

At first I thought it was just me having a complex about growing up. But I don't think it is (or at least, not all). I wish I had a more masculine body. i see pictures of cis men wearing suits and clotehs and everything, and I want to look like that. But I'm not trans. I don't have any lower dysphoria, and I definitely want to be as hairless as possible so I would freak out if I got any more hair lol.

Idk. This is all super confusing. It's like... I want people to see me as a girl. But I want to have a sexless body and I want to get misgendered.

What could this be?? I thought maybe demigirl, but a lot of the definitions say that it doesnt include dysphoria, and I have some kind of dysphoria I think. At least upper dysphoria.

-perceived chest is flat, as opposed to irl chest
-Persistent feeling of wrongness, like a discomfort that's always there, something stuck in my throat that I'm perpetually conscious of. Like when clothing is itchy or fits badly
-Pushing down breasts, only wearing sports bras, hunching over to hide
-Not a dislike of the chest - I'm attracted to breasts and they're alright ones, they're just not for me
-Heavy contributor to depression - it takes a lot of mental energy to deal with the fact that dysphoria makes me feel shit and then still get up and do work and go to class
-Also applies to other aspects of gender - voice, facial shape, hips
-Got really severe during puberty. Has lasted fairly consistently since then. I found identity in being butch

I and others and surgeons and endocrinologist and general doctors and the ultrasound nurse and mri tech can testify under oath.  Your binary is bullshit, and I ain’t imaginary.

Why did I hate them?  Cause I and society compare ourselves against the binary.  5’9” and easily fit size 9 women’s Nike’s and my wedding ring is a size 7 easy

I used to be obsessed with wanting to be NORMAL.  Fock normal. 

I used estrogen blockers and androgen compounding to counter AIS for 2 decades til my liver said fock normal.  

I dig my trans friends cause they have courage to be who they want and not what society wants.  My non-binary friends dgaf and that makes me smile 😊 

I admit seeing a dude in a dress he can’t pull off makes me cringe. But more cause his fashion sense is off and my stupid programming to be that binary lie society loves so much.

I'm engaged to the greatest man in the world. And children are *way* off in the future, but it's a topic that has come up a few times since we got engaged recently.

He wants kids. He was born to be a father, I'm certain of it. He adores kids, kids adore him. He's every woman in a Hallmark movie's dream. I want him to have kids.

I don't *not* want kids. I don't particularly dislike kids. I've always been kind of neutral towards the idea of having them, electing to just go with whatever my partner wanted. I know that if I have kids, I want at least some of them to be biological, and I know he wants biological children.

But everything about pregnancy scares the ever loving shit out of me. 

You throw up a bunch, you can't sleep, you have to pee all the time, your body contorts and swells to make room for a whole other human, and then I have to squeeze this other human out of a space that barely wants to stretch enough for a *pleasurable* experience?

When I thought I was cis I always just brushed this off as not wanting kids. But now that I do kind of want kids, and I know I'm nonbinary, but I still feel so distressed about it, I'm wondering if it's some kind of Dysphoria? I don't really have physical Dysphoria in my every day Life. But seeing a heavily pregnant person or an article about ""10 things they  don't tell you about being pregnant"" makes me feel like my body is trying to turn inside out.

And it's not just pain of childbirth that scares me. The entire experience of being pregnant is repulsive to me. I see these stock images of women lovingly stroking their bulging stomachs and I'm disgusted because it doesn't make sense to me. It's like someone's trying to trick me into thinking this insane thing is something completely fine and normal when it's not. But I know it *is* normal. Or else the human race would not be what it is.

I don't understand how something can put you through 9 months of discomfort and then incredible pain and then you're just like ""this weird lump of human and drool and poop that doesn't even know anything exists yet is my baby that I squished out of me that I love.""

I'm scared that I'm gonna resent my baby even though it's not its fault that I chose to have one. It's not babies' fault that pregnancy sucks so much.

Does anyone else have similar feelings? Did you have kids? Am I just doomed to either muscle my way through a pregnancy or break my fiance's heart? Is there a way to make it better?

My name is Alex. I’m 25 and reside in Southern California. 
My gender identity has always been very controversial for me. Over the years it’s been very easy to just identify as a feminine cis male. I’ve always been feminine. From the very beginning all my friends were girls and I’d always feel “uncomfortable” around men and always was shy around them. I always associated myself with sailor moon and other main female characters in shows. I always wanted to be a girl that would save the world or do good. Even as a child I remember playing video games with my family and friends and only ever wanting to play as a female character (example: daisy from Mario kart etc) As the years went on I came out as gay and was ok. I never really “thought” about it if that makes sense but I always remember not liking to be called a “man” I remember my mom would call me a man and I would shudder as if it was a bad word. To me it was the weirdest thing but again call me slow or whatever but it really didn’t hit me until recently (couple of months ago) that I seriously considered the thought that I may be trans. To be quite honest I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m gender non-binary leaning towards female. I don’t necessarily feel like I’m completely in the wrong body but I do associate myself with wanting curves and smooth skin and even boobs.  My insurance is through Kaiser SoCal and coincidently today I made an appointment to see a physiatrist about a new depression/anxiety medication regime and after seeing a therapist (appointment already made). I was wondering if this is something I should talk to my main doctor about since she I haven’t come out or should I just wait to talk to my physiatrist OR therapist? I’m just a bit confused at what to do or where to start. I wish places made it a little easier especially for people that aren’t fully out yet and or confused.

Hiya. I’m new here and just wanted to get this off my chest. I’m afab and have always had a weird relationship with gender, but only started experimenting with it July last year (I’m 23). U started using they/them pronouns then, in addition to she/her, but since September have been using they/them exclusively. I have really supportive friends who are largely nb and trans themselves, so that’s really helped, but I’m struggling with my family. 

My mums always told me that she’d accept me no matter who I am. I’ve come out to her about my sexuality like, twice, and everything has been fine. She’s not taking gender issues as well. 

It’s weird. She’s helped me bind my chest, even bought me sports bras a size to small while I was dysphoric and waiting for my binder to arrive, but she’s never used the correct pronouns or my preferred name (which is just a shortened form of my birth name). She told me that using my new name might be hard for her to get her head around, which I said was fine. I only want her to try. But she hasn’t been. 

About 2 days ago, she called me by my birth name. When I told her that’s not me name, she said “it is, actually, that’s what your birth certificate says.” And I’ve been dwelling on it for a bit but confronted her about it today. She apologised, and said she’d do better, but I didn’t miss the huge sigh she let out first. 

On top of this, my brother is awful. I’ve been avoiding this subject with him bc I know he doesn’t believe in genders outside of the binary, but my mum went away recently and it was just the 2 of us. It started to weigh on me, so I corrected him about my name and he didn’t take it well. 

I’m hoping to move out soon but damn. I know this could be worse, but the way my mum just does nothing is really frustrating me.

514,2019-02-15 06:38:50,aqttm1,3,1,"Hey all... so, I think I might be non binary. I’ve been thinking about this for a while now but I’m still unsure. I’ve read countless people’s experiences but I still don’t know how I relate or where I fit in. I’ve always felt like I had some sort of gender dysphoria. I know I was assigned female at birth and to my knowledge, I’ve always thought I was female, maybe just a little weird. Except, I never truly felt like I was female. I was always constantly worried everyone thought I was a boy because I just didn’t feel like a girl and thought I looked too androgynous. I still don’t really feel very feminine. I know I’m not a boy though. I’ve always wanted to feel like a girl, but I just don’t. I wish I was more feminine but I just don’t feel it. And I’ve always just chalked it up to being really insecure. But sometimes the way I feel can be debilitating. I feel so ugly and gross and I just don’t want to leave my house sometimes... sometimes I get so obsessed with looking and feeling feminine that I fantasize about getting plastic surgery or I’ll compulsively buy dresses and make up(even though I don’t really enjoy make up). It hit me one day that I could possibly be non binary but I still want to present as female? I’m not sure. I like the idea of being non binary and not just female. It feels like less weight on my shoulders. I feel like, if I tell people I’m female, there are certain expectations for me that I just don’t meet. But if I’m non-binary, it’s different. There are no expectations. I know that being non-binary means different things for different people, but I don’t want to appropriate a term that doesn’t truly apply to me. I’ve heard of non-binary femmes and maybe that could be me? I have no idea. I don’t personally know any non-binary people so I don’t really have anyone I can talk to about this.

From my understanding, sex and gender are separate things. I’ve always felt comfortable with my anatomy itself, but the fact people tend to automatically attach gender identity, expression, and roles with my sex has always felt... wrong.

I thought that would change as I grew up, and I’d gradually adjust to taking on a ‘womanly’ identity, but it never happened lol.

I think the best way to put it is sometimes I’d rather present as more feminine, sometimes masculine, but I enjoy androgynous expression (in myself and potential partners) more often.

587,2019-02-16 23:19:34,areczy,9,4,"Hi,

I'm almost 21, and I was assigned female at birth. I am not really sure about my gender anymore and I wanted to ask for help.

So, I never knew that transitioning was a possibility growing up. I'm from an extremely religious background (Christian/Mormon) and I was really taught to behave in ways that conformed with my community's expectations of women. But, I never really felt comfortable with it. 

I as a kid, even up until grade 3 (around 9 yrs old) would try to tell people my name was different (I chose a male name for myself), and I would say, ""I am a boy"" until it was threatened that my family would be called to get me to stop those behaviors. I would choose clothing that I found in the boys section, I would refuse (to the point of throwing a tantrum) to wear dresses or pink. I was always wanting to play with only boys until I hit puberty (at 9 yrs old which is when I gave up on telling people I was a boy) and all of my male friends rejected me because they were uncomfortable with my boobs and other body changes. In high school I had a posted of Capt. America on my wall and I lifted weights and excercised religiously hoping I would eventually look like him. But, it didn't work.

My family told me that puberty meant I was a woman and that I would have to start shaving, etc. I was pushed into learning to be a ""lady"" very hard. When I didn't do the right thing I was called a dike and other kids told me I was disgusting. So, I just gave in and tried really hard to fit in. 

Now, I think out of fear, I am really good at playing the part. But, it feels like playing a part. When I participate in ""feminine"" behaviors it's almost a parody of it. I will just be over the top. And I don't even feel like my body is mine. It's just something I have and decorate, enjoy, and have fun with. It doesn't really represent my internal experience of the world. I make jokes when I wear a tight dress, like, ""Oh, look I am such a hoe haha."" I'm also bisexual/pansexual and so I almost feel attracted to certain aspects of my own body because I am just that detached from it. 

But lately, I have just hated what I see in the mirror more than usual. I had cut off my hair almost to a buzz cut 2 years ago and nothing made me more confident. But everyone around me complained that my beautiful hair was gone and I should grow it back. Now, it is back and I hate it. It makes me uncomfortable to even look at. I want to hide it. And I am wearing more and more male clothing and feeling more comfortable in it than other clothing items.

At the same time though, I just want people to accept and like me. And to do that I feel like I have to continue on living as a woman. I am scared what will happen if I don't. But, the only way I feel comfortable playing that part is just taking it up to the level of being a cartoon character in appearance. Bright makeup, tight clothes, etc.

Am I experiencing gender dysphoria?

Am I nonbinary because I can live as a woman without it causing huge distress?

How can I tell if this is a phase I will grow out of, or if I am gender fluid, or if I am trans masculine?

**Project Description:** 

The purpose of this study is to explore the self-reported prevalence of gender-voice incongruence in the TING population, and voice-health information seeking behaviors for those individuals who access information and services relating to gender-voice affirmation.  
Any TING individuals, who are residents of the United States of America and 18 years or older, are welcome to complete this survey. If you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to complete one electronic survey. The questions in the survey relate to the prevalence, incidence, and nature of communicative impairment in the TING community, in addition to service and information accessibility relating to gender-voice affirmation. The survey will take approximately 15 minutes to complete.  
Your survey responses will be kept anonymous. You will have the option of providing your name and email address to participate in a prize draw.  No additional identifiable information will be gathered from this survey.  
Your permission is voluntary. Due to the nature of this study, there is a risk that some individuals will experience psychological stress relating to discussing gender-voice incongruence and gender-dysphoria. At any point during the study you may decide to not answer a question, or to cease participation, and be excluded from the study.",NonBinary,[Mod Approved] How well does your voice represent who you are?

This project is about porn sites, and the navigational journeys one goes through in order to find content. Porn sites are said to hold everything and anything you could ever think of. As the old saying goes, “If you can think of it, there is porn of it.” But, is this really true? Just how easy is it to navigate through porn sites, and find content that represents your own desires? These are some of the questions I wish to answer in my master’s thesis. This research is specifically on video “tube” sites (sites such as PornHub, XHamster, XVideos, and so on). Written or audio erotica is not included in the scope of this study. My research will not be used to take an “anti-porn” or “pro-porn” stance, but merely aims to analyse how these free sites are used. For my thesis, I have developed an anonymous online questionnaire.

&amp;#x200B;

You may be eligible to answer this questionnaire if you…

* Are over 18 years old 
* Visit free video porn sites on a regular, or semi-regular basis
* Have a spare 10 minutes

So, i don't know where to start, it's probably the first time i talk about being non-binary on the net and in english !   
I knew that something was wrong when i was a teenager, and for a long time i thought i was trans despite feeling something was not right. Some years ago, still very in the closet, i heard about the possibility of being non-binary and it changed my outlook on this matter. Since then i tried to strip myself from a part of the masculinity i wore (i'm assigned male at birth... AMAB.. ? Is that how we say it..?), i, for one, stopped to wear only black clothes, died and colored some of my hair, adapted a bit of my language and, the most subtle but the most important, i adapted my behavior and what sweat from me, my aura if you prefer.   


I'm still very much inside the closet as i live in a country and in an environment where not gloryfying male identity when you are one is really badly seen (words like « they » also didn't exist in my language).   
I talked very carefully with some people at prides and in some private circles, but non-binary peoples are more scarce than trans, for example.   
I have tons of questions all the times... Like, i do feel that i want to transitionate in some form, but i don't know how. Did you do some sort of transition, even without hormone.. And how do you did it ?   
Over the course of years i projected a lot in my partner (they were all females), is it bad ? I feel like if i talk about that it may seem like i have some sort of fetish for tomboyish girl or androgynous people (and they do have some appeal to me) but deep down i clearly feel it's more than that and more than just wanting to be the other gender (as i'm also aware that the grass seem more green on the other side but it's far more complicated and i should not think so simply).  
I have quite a lot of facial hair and i think they suit me, but then again, i'm confused about this part of my look and how i feel. What do you think about it.. ? Also, as there is no neutral pronouns in my mother tongue, non-binary people made one, i doesn't feel that much invalidated when called by the pronouns corresponding to my gender assignated at birth. It may keep me in the closet and forbid me to stand my ground when needed, tho....   
I'm a bit lost and i feel exposed just with talking about all of that but i'm searching for answers and with the proportion of the subject i have difficulty to think straight, so i'm counting on y'all with sharing some of your experiences.

I'm currently training to be a teacher of English to speakers of other languages. Some of y'all may already realize how anxiety-inducing it can be to be an NB teacher. I've gotten a lot of stares from kids and a LOT of ""Are you a boy or a girl?"" Often, I am so afraid of rejection that I deflect those questions. I don't even try to tell students my pronouns (I will answer to she, but prefer they.) I try to go by my first name to avoid the ""Miss""/""Mister"" situation, but usually they call me ""Miss"" or ""Miss brimohekate"".

There are many reasons why I don't speak up to them. As I said above, I'm afraid they will reject me or refuse to use my pronouns. I don't want to take up class time talking about myself because their learning is more important. I worry about negative parent reactions if students go home and talk about my pronouns or identity. Some of the students come from cultures where nonbinary or trans identities are viewed very negatively, so I'm also fearful that they'll see me as less than. I do think it's essential to be authentic with students, and also that it's important students be educated about NB and trans identities. It's just so hard in practice.

WITH ALL THAT SAID. Last week I helped out in a class where students had to create posters that included their multiple identities and decide which ones they felt marginalized them and which ones they felt gave them privilege. I made my own as a model. Part of the assignment was sharing with other students some of your identities, so I walked around and interacted with them. Most of my identities give me a lot of privilege, but I feel like I am marginalized for my queerness and my gender. I shared this with some students who I thought would take me seriously, and I was so relieved when they accepted what I said. I didn't even share my pronouns, but simply sharing that I don't identify as a woman or a man and often get misgendered felt like a weight lifting off my shoulders.

I came out as a gay man in college, and am happily married to a wonderful man. I've been told that I ""hide"" my homosexuality well (which i take to mean that I present as masculine; I make no effort to keep my sexual orientation a secret). I've often played the leading man in community theater productions.

But...

I remember as a child often telling my siblings and friends that I was a little girl. I remember loving to dress up in heels and dresses, and painting my nails. I've almost always enjoyed many stereotypically feminine pursuits, and almost none of the things that our culture considers masculine appeal to me in the least (sports, power tools, etc.). 

I've often said that I feel like I have a woman's brain in a man's body. My husband calls me ""The Earth Mother"" because of my generous maternal nature. My siblings have told me I'm our mother's clone (very high praise indeed). Younger gay males call me ""Auntie"". 

Even now, I love dressing up in robes and kilts and skirted attire far more than in pants. I own a caftan that I only ever dare wear around the house. Being told unironically that I'm ""pretty"" thrills me way more than being told I'm ""handsome"", which feels like it doesn't fit.

I love the body I have. But I also don't feel like it fully reflects the person I am.

And at half a century old, I find the prospect of undoing everyone else's perceptions of me more than a little daunting.

Am I trans? Am I nonbinary? Am I genderfluid? Am I simply a cis gay male with some effeminate traits? Am I something else?

And how do I know?

I\'ve often played the leading man in community theater productions.\n\nBut...\n\nI remember as a child often telling my siblings and friends that I was a little girl. I remember loving to dress up in heels and dresses, and painting my nails. I\'ve almost always enjoyed many stereotypically feminine pursuits, and almost none of the things that our culture considers masculine appeal to me in the least (sports, power tools, etc.). \n\nI\'ve often said that I feel like I have a woman\'s brain in a man\'s body. My husband calls me ""The Earth Mother"" because of my generous maternal nature. My siblings have told me I\'m our mother\'s clone (very high praise indeed). Younger gay males call me ""Auntie"". \n\nEven now, I love dressing up in robes and kilts and skirted attire far more than in pants. I own a caftan that I only ever dare wear around the house. Being told unironically that I\'m ""pretty"" thrills me way more than being told I\'m ""handsome"", which feels like it doesn\'t fit.\n\nI love the body I have. But I also don\'t feel like it fully reflects the person I am.\n\nAnd at half a century old, I find the prospect of undoing everyone else\'s perceptions of me more than a little daunting.\n\nAm I trans?

736,2019-02-21 15:59:00,at4qjr,2,10,"Hi all! This is a delurking! It's great that this subreddit exists. I wonder if anyone is experiencing what I am--it seems like people post talking about similar situations from time to time, but I don't know who is still here or maybe also new.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I came out to myself as nb a little over a year ago, after *yeeeeearrrs* of being all but there but not doing it for some reason, probably some kind of nb impostor syndrome. (I am far from being the most masculine-presenting person in the world but am still very easily read as a ""man,"" and have tons of social dysphoria and some, but not nearly so much, body dysphoria.) Just in 2019 I've started slowly coming out to friends and at work and school (which are the same place). I've also started HRT at low doses; I've been taking E for six weeks and a day, and spiro for four weeks and a day.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I'm wondering if anyone else has also felt is that my biggest expectation of HRT before starting it was that it would at least clear up for me how much change in my body I want. (I don't expect any of the changes likely on a timeframe of six months or so to make me less happy with my body, and I'd been considering HRT even before I came out to myself, if that makes sense; so strange as it might sound it feels right to have started it even without being 100% certain what I wanted out of it.) But I still feel some uncertainty, if maybe a little less, along with some.. excitement? like it positively is what I want. I haven't noticed any permanent physical changes yet, only softer skin and hair, but of course it's still early, especially at half-doses. If I'm being honest, I both have days where I feel like I should stop, and have days where I feel like asking for full doses and planning to continue on them indefinitely. Has anyone else felt this kind of ambivalence in this kind of situation?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, again, there's that ""not feeling nb enough"" thing. Part of it is that I'm 37, which isn't *exactly* old (lately I keep remembering Dennis in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, saying ""I'm 37, I'm not old!"") but definitely turns up the body dysphoria as I visibly age in ways many amab people do, like my face getting more sort of Neanderthal-shaped and hair loss that isn't super-pronounced (yet) but definitely definitely noticeable. I wish I'd come out and started HRT like 15 years ago, frankly (though I suppose 15 years ago it would have been harder to access, both financially and uh, medical-gatekeeping-ly.) I know this isn't ""supposed to"" be true and maybe it's shitty to give voice to, but it feels to me like it's kind of de facto true, that nb social spaces and even identities aren't really ""for"" people like me, and are more accessible to younger afab people. Has anyone else felt their age complicates ""claiming"" nbness?

First off, I want to thank you for even considering spending your time and energy on my existence. I've been in a very funky place lately and don't feel particularly entitled to ask others for any sort of help. But here I am, in case anyone is feeling generous.

My birth name is the name of a type of tree and I absolutely love that, as I'm a big tree-hugger. However, it is a very gendered name and I'd really love to have something more neutral. I've thought about other names that start with the same letter, but am kind of moving on from that.

777,2019-02-22 17:18:28,atk6h6,10,27,"So yesterday I went to a trans meet up at a bar. This was my experience as a non-binary person.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday I was given short notice of a casual meet up/ trans night at a bar in my city. I decided to go alone despite having anxiety about being without a friend. I got there and was early so I settled in at the bar and had a drink. Being a lightweight a few sips of cheap beer had me smiling and ready to meet people. The organizers showed up and I got to talking to them and then sitting a a big table with the group. For about an hour or so I was talking to a transman and another afab non-binary person about hormones, surgery and our experiences at local doctors. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the other non-binary person, I'll call Pat,  was with their trans girlfriend, I'll call Amanda (not their actual names). Amanda was across the table and we didn't really talk at all. Well halfway through a conversation Pat notices that a very shy person has arrived and is floating around the table. Pat invites them to sit and started talking to them. In that process Amanda makes space for them by switching to sit by me.

&amp;#x200B;

Amanda and I start talking about trans experiences, stuff like hair cuts our voices etc. At first it's fine but then Amanda says to me, ""I would call myself a chaser of trans people while being trans. I just want to sleep with all the trans people-"" then she looks me up and down and clarifies, ""Especially more trans gir- trans guys.""

&amp;#x200B;

I smile awkwardly and shake my head and explain that I don't identify as a guy. At that point I had introduced myself and my preferred pronouns. She shrugs and says, ""Well you look like a guy so I'm just going to think of you that way."" Normally that would bother me enough to end a conversation but I was drunk and giving her more  lenience  as she is also a trans person. Anyways I try to explain again that I am not a guy and not a girl. She kinda blows it off and asks me if im poly. I say no, that my partner and I are practicing monogamy and i'm very committed to them.

&amp;#x200B;

From there the conversation turned. She then asked  if I have bottom dysphoria. I answer honestly and say not really, that I've wondered what a penis is like but I don't really want one. She then started talking about her genitals a lot, I don't talk about mine. Mostly she's saying that she doesn't mind her penis unless it's during sex. The conversation isn't really something I want to talk about or share so I didn't say much, just listened with a drunk dopey expression.

&amp;#x200B;

At some point she asks me to sit away from the group because she can't hear me. I had just finished a drink and was happy drunk and followed her over to a bench. I was trapped in and couldn't really get out unless I asked her to move. At first it didn't bother me. Until she reached her arm around the back of the bench and joked, ""I'm not being very subtle.""  I inched away. She said, ""I wanted to sleep with my boyfriend Pat before coming here but he (not Pat's pronouns) wasn't into it. I want to sleep with you.""

&amp;#x200B;

Little drunk me was assertive and said , ""I am not interested in that. I'm only interested in talking. I'm very in love and committed to my partner."" 

&amp;#x200B;

Amanda looked at me and said, ""Yeah I can tell you're committed and not interested. Ya know being rejected over and over again makes me dysphoric."" That made me feel bad, I wasn't trying to cause dysphoria. At the time I wasn't thinking clearly and didn't realize how manipulative that is from one trans person to another. 

&amp;#x200B;

I thought she understood I didn't want anything sexual until a few seconds later she pointed down at her lap and said, ""Look I'm getting hard."" I glanced and then looked away. Before I could say anything she added, ""If you want you can touch it to see what's it's like. It's not cheating because I wont get anything out of it.""

&amp;#x200B;

I say no. And she shrugs and says, ""I'm autistic so I don't get boundaries."" At that moment the guy who told me about the meet up was leaving and waved. I waved and then remarked that I needed to go because I wake up early. I left before I felt sober enough to and somehow made it to a friends apartment safely to hang out with their dog until I sobered up enough to trek home over icy sidewalks.

&amp;#x200B;

It was an advertised safe space for trans people with no chasers welcomed. I let my guard down and was invalidated and harassed by another trans person.

After I got my first binder it really sunk in that this was something I needed to do. But I keep having doubts. I know I come off as feminine, especially my voice and height, and I feel silly, almost emberassed correcting people if they call me she.

I told my partner being called she makes me uncomfortable and he said I should have told him sooner. And went on to explain that I feel silly correcting people. He didn't really know what to say, I don't really blame him.

I feel like when I see other feminine enbys I get kind of annoyed because I see myself and my insecurities in them. How the heck do they feel comfortable being themselves??

Sometimes I wonder if the problem is that I want to become more masculine, but I'm really not sure. I mainly dislike having a feminine chest (although I do have mild dysphoria about other things) and I don't think I would feel comfortable with all of the possible changes T can cause.

843,2019-02-24 21:32:15,aucuxx,1,1,"So... I've been thinking I might be nb. Don't know for sure yet and there's some thoughts that I've been having quite often. I know you can't confirm or deny my gender and it's up to me to figure it out but still, I'm not asking for someone to tell me if i'm ""valid enough"" just tell me if you think my thoughts are something y'all might relate to or not.

I'm a 21 years old amab person but I started considering seriously when I was 20 (isn't that kinda old to notice? I dunno). I guess I never quite fit into the man role, growing up not particularly masculine with both boys and girls as friends and with interests that aren't very gendered and all that stuff, witch I thought I could explain entirely when I discovered I was sexualy attracted to people of all genders (I use the word bisexual to describe me but I guess pansexual would also work). I thought, ""great all this pointlessly gendering of people and other stuff just stuck me as odd because I don't know what its like to only be able to feel attraction to one half of the people"".

Later in life I started following some trans people online (I have never met a trans person irl) and even some nb people. I was aware of the term but now it wasn't just a word, it was actual people and that forced me to ask, if people like me can be whatever gender they want then what makes me be a man? I don't have a good reason, earlier the reason was ""I have a penis"" and after that ""I'm pretty sure im not a woman"" but now there's more options and the lable of non binary doesn't sound like a bad otion at all. I've used ""they"" as a pronoun online but having people who don't know me and who I don't know call me ""they"" doesn't do much. Even before I even considered this I had stated that I ""didn't care about being grammatically correct with gender"" (I'm spanish and in that language you gender pretty much everyhing and sometimes people had mocked me for ""being gay"" or sometimes acknowledged it without mockery by talking about me in femenine, so I would reply with my sentiment that grammatical gender doesn't make much sense)

Here's the thing, I don't have dysphoria. I feel like I could wake up tomorrow with a ""woman's body"" and not care about it, but I don't dislike my body at all. I don't want to medically alter it, not because I wouldn't like the results but because I wouldn't care and it's too much trouble to go through. Honestly not much would change if I finaly knew what word to use to describe me, and because of that I tell myself to not worry so much and just wear the things that I want and continue to use makeup and to look and act how I want (witch I admit I don't always do if there's people watching).

Still I keep coming back to it. Am I a femenine guy or a nb person? How do I know? Is the fact that I keep coming back to it proof? couldn't a cis guy be confused too and thats what I am? Am I too old for this to be true? How would I even begin to explain that to people on top of my sexuality? my parents don't even know I'm bi. Am I looking for a lable to explain a common feeling even among cis people? Am I getting in on a group with an actual valid issue while I acctually don't belong in it? Basicaly, am I non binary?

I know the woke answer tends to be ""you're a valid nb no matter what"" but I also think it's valid to be cis (obviously) so don't tell me I sound nb to you if it's just because it's the correct thing to say. I'm asking for honesty.

How do you refer to a nonbinary person when the word ""they"" doesn't exist in your language? 

In spanish, every single noun is gendered, and so are all singular 3rd person pronouns and plural 1st and 3rd.  So I've always wondered how to deal with that.

I'm AFAB. Through the past 7-8 or so years of questioning (from 20 to now, 27/8) and figuring out my gender identity I've decided I'm transmasc non binary. Essentially I want to transition via HRT to change my body fat redistribution and voice to be more male but I still love effeminate things and may still want to wear lace and frills and shiny things and jewelry and all of that, though socially I am a little worried about my life being threatened as a result, and about dating becoming much more difficult as a trans person, though these are just perceptions and may not be fully valid fears. I also want kids, am approaching 30, and feel like I'd prefer to transition after having kids, I don't have dysphoria about giving birth because I want my own kids, though who knows when that will happen and I worry about my hypothetical kids being treated poorly due to my transness, though the world nowadays seems like a more open and accepting place which is a relief. Basically, there are a lot of social things holding me back, but it seems like I still want to transition. I like getting neat nail art and I love makeup. But I know I'm not a woman. I've thought about this and thought maybe in many ways it would be easier masquerading as my assigned gender for life since because of my interests it comes relatively easily but throughout the years there has remained this relatively persistent discomfort with the idea of just living as my assigned gender. My dysphoria and desire to feel male comes in waves, but it does come and has consistently throughout time which makes me think this must be a permanent feeling if I keep thinking this way. I think I ignore my dysphoria most of the time to where it feels minimal. I try to focus instead on the parts of my body that I enjoy that I find more masculine. I'm slowly trying to navigate ""cross dressing"" and wearing men's clothes which can be a little tough to make work on  a female body. Anyway not sure what else to say so I'll end this here.

919,2019-02-26 21:49:28,av52aj,7,14,"Hi ! 

I'm a non binary individual, somewhat confused.

I guess it always and still comes down to my need to feel validated, because I feel very ""insecure"" about my non-binary identity.

I'm afab, and my presentation, although I wouldn't call it feminine, includes feminine stuff. I guess I probably look queer, but I can often wear clothes that are typically feminine, and like it. Basically I like some feminine stuff but I don't like that they make me a girl/woman by association. 

I have been on T for 3 months now, and I know that although I do and will like the changes (some of them), it isn't a necessity for me. And I guess I'm on HRT partly because it helps to validate my identity (kinda). Like if my body is masculine or ambiguous, then the importance of the clothes on my body is diluted by half ?

I don't know where I'll get with T, I don't think I want my body to be super masculinized, and T is not likely to get me there before some time.

Right now I like the changes, I like my voice dropping, and I'm curious to see my longer peach fuzz because something else (maybe). 

&amp;#x200B;

But I don't know, maybe I want T, to be able to prove to others and myself that I'm NB ? Is that a bad thing ?

I never considered myself to really have dysphoria. I wouldn't mind some changes in my body, but I also don't mind my body. Social dysphoria maybe, but even that, it's more of being kinda annoyed, not much more than that. So what does that mean ? 

&amp;#x200B;

PS : I'm aware that NB people can be feminine. NB can look any kind of way they want and be valid. But I just don't want to be seen as a woman.

That simply by existing, whatever I do, I'm demonstrating 'womanhood'.  It kind of falls into a  feminist 'woman can make whatever the hell choices they please' area. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I've always felt a little disconnected to classical femininity. I remember being confused as to whether or not I was a tomboy in elementary. I think adults would call me one because of my butchy haircut, but I was also a little ballerina and often dressed in pastels and dresses so that term never felt right. 

&amp;#x200B;

The intricacies of girl clothing did come easy to me in middle school. I remember leaving a basketball team tryout before it even started because I walked in wearing our gym uniform shirt and not something more sporty like everyone else.  It was a look of 'ohhh this is after-hours so everyone's chill and I didn't get the memo', coupled with thoughts of 'I'm not good enough at basketball to justify being this uncool.'  Also in middle school I felt this strong pull to be 'one of the guys', but never really acted on it.  This pull often got confused by me with having crushes. Maybe what I was admiring or longing for that I saw in these boys' circles was actually privilege?  My group of girlfriends was often felt demure, polite, and sweet. The boys just seemed more carefree.  

There was also a time here where I cut my hair pixie short and was teased. My mother reminded me that I vowed 'never again' when I, now 24, cut my hair again.

&amp;#x200B;

This haircut I've recently got finally feels 'right' to me.  **I like being able to throw my hair back in a little mini-manbun and not feel like a woman-who-doesn't-try-hard-enough.**  I'm never really sure if that pressure was real or manufactured by me when I was in high school.  Even as a senior, I was certainly the least feminine, least cool/fun girl on the dance team. I had this ideal vision of getting on to the dance team my senior year (I had tried out as a freshmen and not made it) and then promptly cutting off all my hair and dyeing it a pastel purple. Not so much to stand out, but to make a point. There was always a certain 'look' to dance teams, some of it written and some of it unwritten, and I just wanted to point out the ways in which we had the freedom to be different, yet no one ever did.  I ended up not doing it because I was angling for a classical musical role and didn't want to wear a wig.  My theatre dork won out over my secret inner punk.

&amp;#x200B;

So near the end of high school, 'boys' loomed larger in the the collective nerdgirl conscience at my school than they had in previous years. And I coupled up just like everyone else.  First relationships are somehow clumsy, boring, and overly intense all at the same time. Check, check, and check.  The main queer takeaway was that I often felt like I was pretending. Pretending that I was straight? Pretending that I was female? yes and no... More like pretending that I was a girlfriend that felt comfortable in traditionally girlfriend spaces/roles.  And really the bigger issue was that we were both pretending we were 'in a relationship' when in reality we were teens playing at a relationship because we wanted to get laid before college. Took me way too long to realize that btw.

&amp;#x200B;

*""My body tells me noooo-oh. But I won't quit 'cause I want more.""*

 As a 19-year-old female at a normal BMI, I gained 40 lbs in less than 6 months.  Imma be honest here. That takes a concentrated effort.  I has some issues, alrite?  And then genetics and poor self-discipline and some major depression helped spring me to being over 100 pounds overweight just a few years later.  I tend to think this is a unique situation, very different then some freshmen 15 stereotype.  I had an incredibly average female body for 19 years.  Weight, height, build, shoe size, proportion, you name it. And then I straightup ballooned. My mindset was always that I would get back down eventually, and it still is: 45 down, 55 to go.

All of this body setup anyways, is to say that **I do not feel like myself**. I have not felt like myself in different ways for a long time. Sometimes, because of the guy I was dating, sometimes because of the weight gain, sometimes because my gender identity/sexuality feels... questionable, most often because of depression.  At this point, if we're trying to trace back to when I felt normal, we're in high school and I certainly don't want to go back to being that sparkle cloud of naiveté attempting to pass for a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

With the worst of the depression and denial about depression years behind me, and recently more actively working on the weight loss, more space has freed up for this gender/sexuality question,  But a lot of me wants to deny (as I am wont to do) this until after I've lose the rest of the weight.  For myself and others, having accomplished a big forward life move first, makes the concept easier to deal with than if it just seems like another in a long string of fuckups.

&amp;#x200B;

Sexuality wise, Idfk. I haven't been legit interested/attracted to anyone in years. And if anyone's shown any interest in me, my response is, in effect, 'well, you're wrong.' My attitude towards them is typically 'I wouldn't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member.' And this reaction is certainly tied in with the depression and obesity.

Whenever I do feel slight interest/attraction, I'm not confident in it.  With all genders, I find myself questioning if I want to fuck this person or emulate them.  Just apply both pieces of the 'he's the type of guy that men want to be, and women want to be with,' to those you have remotely positive feelings towards and that's where I'm at. I'm constantly like 'Is this admiration or attraction?'  So at this juncture, I have no idea what to look for in a partner, for dating, hookups. Whatever, there's more to unpack there, but I'm digressing and this post is already a ramble and a half.

&amp;#x200B;

I check female on all the forms. I don't think any sort of hormone will ever be for me. But I have a new name picked out. But I don't necessarily feel like I fit under the trans umbrella. But I think I will want some sort of breast reduction/mastectomy/lift once I lose the rest of the weight. I have no idea what coming out looks, sounds or feels like for a nonbinary person. Or if that even applies to me. So yeah, I'm questioning. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR**

questioning person looks over past possibly nonbinary life stuff and could use some thoughts/support from those who know what's what.  
Any suggestions (related books, media, etc)? advice?

But I won\'t quit \'cause I want more.""*\n\n As a 19-year-old female at a normal BMI, I gained 40 lbs in less than 6 months.  Imma be honest here. That takes a concentrated effort.  I has some issues, alrite?  And then genetics and poor self-discipline and some major depression helped spring me to being over 100 pounds overweight just a few years later.  I tend to think this is a unique situation, very different then some freshmen 15 stereotype.  I had an incredibly average female body for 19 years.  Weight, height, build, shoe size, proportion, you name it. And then I straightup ballooned. My mindset was always that I would get back down eventually, and it still is: 45 down, 55 to go.\n\nAll of this body setup anyways, is to say that **I do not feel like myself**. I have not felt like myself in different ways for a long time. Sometimes, because of the guy I was dating, sometimes because of the weight gain, sometimes because my gender identity/sexuality feels... questionable, most often because of depression.  At this point, if we\'re trying to trace back to when I felt normal, we\'re in high school and I certainly don\'t want to go back to being that sparkle cloud of naiveté attempting to pass for a person. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith the worst of the depression and denial about depression years behind me, and recently more actively working on the weight loss, more space has freed up for this gender/sexuality question,  But a lot of me wants to deny (as I am wont to do) this until after I\'ve lose the rest of the weight.  For myself and others, having accomplished a big forward life move first, makes the concept easier to deal with than if it just seems like another in a long string of fuckups.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSexuality wise, Idfk. I haven\'t been legit interested/attracted to anyone in years. And if anyone\'s shown any interest in me, my response is, in effect, \'well, you\'re wrong.\' My attitude towards them is typically \'I wouldn\'t want to belong to any club that would have me as a member.\' And this reaction is certainly tied in with the depression and obesity.\n\nWhenever I do feel slight interest/attraction, I\'m not confident in it.  With all genders, I find myself questioning if I want to fuck this person or emulate them.  Just apply both pieces of the \'he\'s the type of guy that men want to be, and women want to be with,\' to those you have remotely positive feelings towards and that\'s where I\'m at. I\'m constantly like \'Is this admiration or attraction?\'  So at this juncture, I have no idea what to look for in a partner, for dating, hookups. Whatever, there\'s more to unpack there, but I\'m digressing and this post is already a ramble and a half.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI check female on all the forms. I don\'t think any sort of hormone will ever be for me. But I have a new name picked out. But I don\'t necessarily feel like I fit under the trans umbrella. But I think I will want some sort of breast reduction/mastectomy/lift once I lose the rest of the weight. I have no idea what coming out looks, sounds or feels like for a nonbinary person. Or if that even applies to me. So yeah, I\'m questioning. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nquestioning person looks over past possibly nonbinary life stuff and could use some thoughts/support from those who know what\'s what.  \nAny suggestions (related books, media, etc)? advice? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/dzflq8e6q2j21.jpg\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Questioning', 'created': 1551282399.0}"

&amp;#x200B;

so a little backstory, I'm 23 and I've been IDing as nonbinary/genderqueer for multiple years (maybe 6?)

I've had a binder, but I've gained weight so for a couple years couldn't wear it... the other day I found out I could wear it again (barely!) and I was really happy. I've only actually worn it a couple of times mainly because I'm autistic and I had a bit of a time with the seams.

I never thought top surgery would be an option for me (expensive, I have doctor/surgery phobia, various things) so I just never really considered it apart from wishful thinking. BUT now I know it's a possibility! all of the sudden. And I'm not sure if it's some sort of weird genderqueer thing where I really want to transition for a while until i feel more femme again (though I don't so much fluctuate genders or anything, just a sort of ""I'm presenting more masc/femme today"" thing)

&amp;#x200B;

When I was a kid, in 5th grade sex-ed/puberty classes when I found out I would grow a chest I had a really rough time getting to terms with that.

&amp;#x200B;

 I've never really felt connected to my chest (and apparently, I did my measurements with an online calculator and it says I'm about a 42i...) . I feel like it's just a bit of a nusiance, but at the same time mostly I don't think much about it.  


I do really want to have like, that look of wearing a shirt and it's all just flat. I also absolutely hate how I look and feel in the shower and the mirror. But at the same time, I'm really concerned I would miss it if it was gone??  


When I was looking at the surgeon's results (there's a facebook group for him) I saw quite a few people who had double incision without nipple grafts and it's like, I've always hated my nipples and was thinking top surgery with nipples would be weird on me (but thought asking for without would be really weird, until I saw those pictures - I've always kind of wanted a ken-doll appearance, essentially)  


I'm in the middle of a big weight loss thing (I started out as 262 at 5'5""... due to PCOS and uncontrollable weight gain, which I'm now on meds for) so I'm definitely going to wait until I'm smaller before being super serious about getting this, both to help the surgeon get all the fat and put the scars in the right place and so I don't need revision if I lose weight later on.. so I'm not deciding right away but it would be nice to know the general direction I want to go with this (which would probably be 1-3 years before I could do it)

&amp;#x200B;

I have a general history of being obsessed with something until I get it (though never something relating to my body before, but who knows?) and I'm wondering if this is that, where it's a super strong obsession and I eventually cave in and hope i don't regret it (hello $1k drawing tablet!) or if it's something real and I just didn't realize I ever could do it so I just pushed it out of my mind but now that I know it's possible, it's all just happening now?

&amp;#x200B;

IDK, I've had a **really** confusing week going through to maybe I should start low dose/short term T, maybe I should just binary transition, even though I'm nonbinary? myabe I should just forget about this whole thing and live it as I already am?

I\'ve only actually worn it a couple of times mainly because I\'m autistic and I had a bit of a time with the seams.\n\nI never thought top surgery would be an option for me (expensive, I have doctor/surgery phobia, various things) so I just never really considered it apart from wishful thinking. BUT now I know it\'s a possibility! all of the sudden. And I\'m not sure if it\'s some sort of weird genderqueer thing where I really want to transition for a while until i feel more femme again (though I don\'t so much fluctuate genders or anything, just a sort of ""I\'m presenting more masc/femme today"" thing)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I was a kid, in 5th grade sex-ed/puberty classes when I found out I would grow a chest I had a really rough time getting to terms with that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n I\'ve never really felt connected to my chest (and apparently, I did my measurements with an online calculator and it says I\'m about a 42i...) . I feel like it\'s just a bit of a nusiance, but at the same time mostly I don\'t think much about it.  \n\n\nI do really want to have like, that look of wearing a shirt and it\'s all just flat.

Currently we live in the south though where it is very conservative, and that makes me nervous. However, my dysphoria gets worse as time passes and I can’t take it for much longer. So I think I’ll “come out” again soon and try to get into therapy or something. I probably won’t go full time or anything like that anytime soon but I want some of this pressure off me. \n\nThanks for taking your time to read this and let me know any thoughts, questions, or anything.

And for me, who does not hate or dislike their body, the answer would neither be yes nor no. Which makes this already difficult to explain topic of being trans even more difficult. But I found a way to explain it to people that works at least for me, and I am curious what you people think of it.

I would describe my relationship with my current body and thus, gender, kind of like a person and a car (mind, not counting in like these massive car-nuts. they would ruin this comparison). Everyone has one, knowing how to use it is more or less common knowledge and there are a plethora of different types. The problem with my car is that I can't see it, but everyone else can. I can use it, I can drive it to get to places. But that's it. I can't maintain it, because even though I might notice that something is wrong, I couldn't find the fault, couldn't look under it's hood. If it has one, which I don't really know. Meaning that even if I get sick, I know I am sick, but even after 22 yours of living, I can't properly tell a cold from the flu. I can't read the glowing warning signs a car shows when something is broken.  
Other people upgrade their car, make it more ""theirs"" and personalize it. Which I would really like to do and most of the time even try to, to some extend. But whatever I do, I don't see it. My car could be a neon pink glowing monster truck (which would be fucking fancy by the way) or a small smart with one seat and 2 doors, perfect to get even the smallest parking spot.

16,2019-02-01 15:34:28,am36ww,4,1,"when you say that you're transitioning from male to female and viceversa you're basically saying that you were a man/woman or even ARE right now just because you don't look/act as what is associated with a man or woman. 

if you're a trans girl, that's it! you are a trans girl, and not an MtF. you have always been a girl regardless of when you noticed it or your genitalia.

if you were born with a penis, you weren't born a boy, you were assigned male at birth.
being amab (assigned male at birth) doesn't make your genitalia male, if you identify as a girl your whole body is female. or isn't it ridiculous to say that someone's ears are female or male? so it is with trans people's genitals.

and same thing with trans boys.

side note: i didn't include non-binary people here because there is no term such as MtF or FtM for them (or i don't know any).

also, some trans people don't like to dress up or act as they are supposed to do ""according"" to their gender (socially) and it's okay too, and not because of it they're less trans.

and more thing, transitioning is different for each person and for some people it may be just changing name and pronouns, while for some others it may be changing their look, taking hormones, getting surgeries... and they're all equally valid and trans! so please respect that some trans people don't want to take hormones or get any surgery and don't press them.


back to the main topic, instead of using those terms (MtF and FtM), why don't we use AMAB and AFAB (Assigned Male At Birth and Assigned Female At Birth)? it's inclusive for nb people and it's not transphobic!

It all started with a one piece bathing suit in my sisters bathroom- after that I found tights and skirts and would play dress up by myself and look at myself on the mirror. 
As a teenager, I experimented with more girl clothes and got more comfortable showing others and presenting as a female , but only at night when I had a buzz.  During the day I was a boy and I dated girls. I’ve mostly only had sex with girls, but I would always fantasize that I was the one being penetrated. What’s weird is that I’ve always been sexually attracted to girls because I love the way their bodies look and I want to be them. I had many bad experiences with cis sex where I couldn’t get it up because I wanted to be the girl not the boy. Like I wanted to be passive but I was expected to be the aggressor and I couldn’t perform. 
Usually when I’m having sex with a girl, I visualize myself as the one being penetrated and that’s how I get off. 

Anyway, my life went on and I continued cross dressing in secret and hiding it from my girlfriends because I was too ashamed of myself. I felt like it was just a weird fetish and not something intrinsic to my sexuality. I would go through phases where I would collect women’s clothes and wear them in secret and take pictures of myself. Then I would get afraid and purge all my clothes and throw them away, but I inevitability I would end up buying more a few months later. 

Fast forward to now and I’m married with kids and I always think my cross dressing days are behind me because I’ll have periods of time where it’s not that ever present in my thought, but then out of nowhere I’ll start the whole cycle again. I’m at a point now where I’m actively cross dressing again but I feel shame and am scared. 

I told my wife about 7 years ago about my cross dressing and she was not supportive at all. She thinks it’s gross and doesn’t want anything to do with it. She did allow me to go out as a girl for a summer, but never would allow my to be a girl around her. She finds the whole thing troubling and thinks it’s some deviant fetish that I should absolutely not tell my kids about. So that’s where I am now. After 5 years of little to no feelings of dysphoria, I now find my feelings stronger than ever and I want to stop feeling shame about it. I just ordered a bunch of clothes and boobs from Amazon and I want to wear them out. I also just shaved my legs and I have to hide it from everyone because I know my wife will react badly. But I really like the way I look as a girl and I want to just embrace my feminine side and wear eyeliner if I want to, or wear parties every day.

62,2019-02-03 19:08:45,amsr3r,0,1," Hiya doods! I hope this is a good place to ask this. I saw transgender identities and depersonalization coexisting with plenty of people so I decided to ask here. 

I recently realised I might be trans to some extent. The thing is, for quite a few years(4-5 I'd say. Blew up about when I entered puberty) I had symptoms related to depersonalization but I didn't know this was a thing until today or yesterday. Because of that, I'm even unsure where I stand on that trans scale...

 Even me realising I'd like to be a girl more happened in an odd fashion. I had a dream that brought a little flame for a few hours, then followed by a few more events I realised that. Until I actually talked with a friend about this I didn't feel any emotion apart from a bit after that dream. Felt a bit of fear before I started talking about it but that's to be expected. Even that self-discovery only filled me with goodness for 1.5 days and then I went back to my old emotional numb self. I really wish the woman voice was stronger. It's just so passive and I don't feel much about it either. It feels really wrong and I feel even worse than I do normally due to my emotional numbness. I say I feel worse but this is more of what my heart says I should be feeling. I'm still numb regarding that.

 Those 1.5 days I mentioned brought me more positive feelings than I got in years. I was so happy I could've burst. I do feel like I have this disorder. My intuition also tells me I have it, and I always listen to it. I just feel like it's not real and I wanted someone to help me figure it out.

Now that I feel like I summarized my condition decently enough, I'll talk a bit about my symptoms:

-Emotional Numbness. Besides negative thoughts coming from art and the good feelings I get sometimes when meditating on my girl identity I feel absolutely no emotion.
- Feeling as the world is flat and lifeless
- I feel I am like a robot, who's just going through the motions. I almost always am this way at school. It does happen at home when I indulge in what I want too though but not all the time
-I feel disconnected from life and people

 There's probably a few more things I didn't think of mentioning. These are the heavy hitters though. I felt really lost ever since I figured this trans thing out. Realising I have this disorder too makes it worse. It keeps me further away from feeling anything towards me as a woman and I feel like this hurts me most now. I really want to nurture this further but this thing is keeping me away from that. 

I'd really appreciate if you people could tell me if those signs are enough to diagnose myself with that. I also don't know what the root of the problem is. Could it be caused by depression or maybe the fact that I could be trans? My intuition kind of points me towards the latter but I'm not sure. If anyone knows of any tricks to lower the power of this disorder, please let me know. Also, sorry for beating around the bush so much. I always feel anxious when asking for advice here.

1970s - There was a mondo film called *Let Me Die a Woman* that showed trans women and surgery exist, but it was a fringe phenomenon.

1980s - Tula was on the cover of Playboy.  Being exposed ruined her career as a woman, but it exposed young people like me to the concept of transition.  I thought she must have been very lucky to have parents who understood and encouraged her, but, no, the reality was nothing like that.  In fact, Tula only found out about transition through her involvement in the gay subculture.  Meanwhile, there were ""shemale"" porn ads in Hustler, which puzzled and intrigued me.

1990s - Drag queens.  Divine.  RuPaul.  There were female impersonators, but it was all a show, gender performance.

2000s - Early Internet Age.  There were websites about transition, and there was a whole lot of ""shemale"" porn.  Transitioning still seemed crazy and not really an option.

2010s - Internet Age.  Now teens are transitioning and transgender women are a *lot* prettier.  It's no longer some strange phenomenon in foreign countries and, get this, people accept them as their preferred gender.  A revolution seems to be happening.  It's okay now to come out, and HRT is readily available to anyone.  People are still saying transgender = mental illness and enforcing a rigid concept of the gender binary, and people on the other side of the issue are saying things that don't stand up under scrutiny or that push an ideological agenda, but the overall cultural trend is towards being transgender being okay.

That's pretty much how I experienced history.  There are non-linear jumps, but I think the timeline is pretty accurate.

I hope this helps you understand why non-passing middle-aged trans women are coming out now and maybe sometimes seem to hold transphobic beliefs.  The current trans culture is just completely new and unlike anything that happened before.  In the past, you'd have to be lucky enough to be attracted to men and engaged in the gay subculture to even think about transition, and still today it's fairly unthinkable for an AMAB to transition without desiring to be fucked.  The new paradigm is totally new.

In case I come off as a homophobic transbian, I want to note that getting fucked did enter my prepubescent fantasies.  I just grew up dating women and learned to love penetration.  Even when you hate your genitals, you learn to enjoy what they do for you, and for me putting my penis inside vagina was very pleasurable.

80,2019-02-04 20:44:42,an63ox,2,1,"I totally also made this post in r/offmychest but I feel like its also applicable to this subreddit.

 

Hi. So I'm new to Reddit, as well as what I'm about to talk about. I decided to make a Reddit account mostly to vent because, well, I have many friends and family on my other social media accounts that I can't necessarily come out with a lot of what's going on in my head right now. Especially since much of my family is homophobic, as well as transphobic.

I've been dealing with identity issues since I've finally gone to college, and to be frank, I'm slightly terrified of this whole ordeal. Going to school in a big city is terrifying, and now that I'm here, it's weird to even consider myself the same person I was, possibly about 5-6 months ago. In high school I was the weird kids, maybe in some ways, I guess I still am, but that's besides the point.

Ever since I've gone off to college, I've felt much different about myself, and I realized that, maybe I'm not the butch lesbian I thought I was, just when I thought I was so certain in myself for the first time. I'm starting to feel as though, physically, yes, I am a woman, but instead of being a woman mentally, I began to realize I might feel more comfortable with being a man rather than a woman.

To be honest, this terrifies, and excites me at the same time. Though I totally respect those who are immediately accepting of themselves when it comes to changing identities, I'm slightly scared of this new change because it is change. Not only that, but also because I have a fear of possibly losing friends, ruining relationships, and stressing out familial bonds, like I had the first time I had come out as a lesbian.

It was about a month ago that I told my girlfriend that I felt this way, and to my luck, she just cracked a dumb joke about being bisexual, and told me that she'd support me no matter what I did. Which, of course, I cried because I'm a big softy when it comes to that kind of stuff (haha), but I just am really glad she's accepting me for who and what I want to be.

I want to lose weight, learn how to say 'no' more often, become the man I want to be, and maybe someday, when we're both out of college, I want to get an apartment with her and just..make her happy. We're currently in a 115 mile distance distant relationship (which, isn't as far as some, I understand. And I am visiting her this Friday as of posting, which I'm beyond excited about. It's been about a month since I've seen her, and we've been texting non-stop about it. As well as seeing her. I get to meet up with some high school friends I haven't seen in forever as well.) and it sometimes is hard. It makes me happy, though, to be able to see her more often than some long-distance relationships would be.

I'm just happy she's here for me, and I know I'm so beyond lucky to have her.

I absolutely love most trans people but I find this specific subset to be really loud and toxic and I don't understand why they need to be that way at all? 

I've met so many M to F people who actively post nudes showing off their tits, dressing up to a t wearing sexy dresses, ect that then tell cis men they're gay for finding them attractive ect. 

From an outside perspective of a Cis woman I find this toxic to the community in so many ways. I feel like this sub group takes away from presenting trans who are deeply ingrained in the community by presenting outsiders who are undereducated with massive toxicity that fuels hate. 

So I guess what I'm looking for is: 

Do any of you as agree with this POV at all or am I just looking at it from the wrong angle? 

If I'm looking at it incorrectly, can you explain your POV on this subgroup? 

Just looking for education, any and all respectful POVs greatly appreciated.

(Sorry if this is just a huge wall of text. I really need to get my feelings out to someone, and since I don’t have a Therapist, I guess Reddit will have to do for now. Thank you for reading this. I can’t even begin to tell you how much I appreciate it.)

Holy shit I feel really fucking nervous posting this. I’ve thought about not posting this all day until I eventually said fuck it. Who knows. I might delete this later

I think I am trans. I’ve been wrestling with my gender and sexual identity for 2 years now, and I would be surprised if this wasn’t the the case. 

However this post isn’t really about that.

I feel so alone. For reference. I am a 17 year AMAB senior in high school. I live in a small town in a conservative state with conservative parents that I am certain are very transphobic. I have very few friends that have varying opinions on trans people ranging from not really caring to thinking the “whole trans thing” is stupid and ridiculous to actively calling people traps. I really don’t have anyone to go to and tell my feelings to. The crappy thing is that I would try to go to a therapist, but as far as I can tell. Out of the very few therapists in my town. None of them seem to be trans friendly. I can’t even go to school councilors due to them having outed a gay kid to their parents before.

And the thing is, I’m not even sure I should even transition. I want to go into music education. Specifically vocal music, and I’m not sure if I can ever achieve a female vocal range. I’m going to college on a vocal music scholarship, and I’m worried that trying to transition during college may get that taken away from me. 

Should I wait till college to start transitioning? Should I keep it a secret from my family? Should I continue to pursue vocal music if I am trans? Where should I start? What should I do? Who am I? Questions like these keep me up at night. I don’t know the answers, and I don’t know if I will ever get the answers. I feel lost, alone, and isolated from the people around me. Because I think that I’m trans, and that’s not acceptable where I live.

I hope things will be better in the future. Maybe I can finally have some clarity on where my life is going. I might have to make choices that are hard, such as leaving my dad who I have a good relationship with, and considers me his favorite son since my other two brothers have ignored him as soon as they moved out. I don’t want to leave everything behind if I transition, but that might be what I have to do.

I just wish I had someone to talk to

I am a high school teacher that has a quite good understanding of teenagers as well as what many teens face in middle/high school and I love my own kids’ friends like they are my own.

Within 1 hour of him getting it home, his dad had flipped his room upside down and found the binder, took it, found my name on the shipping package, and told him he may no longer see his best friend (my kid).

My own teen read it - and they said it basically his dad says how “irresponsible” I acted and again - they can never seen one another again outside of school.

My whole life I’ve spent with a nagging feeling in the back of my head that told me I’m not supposed to be this way.  That I’d be happier, or more content, or fit in better if I was a girl.  This feeling was with me as long as I can remember.  Mostly I would suppress it.  Sometimes it would come out in little subconscious ways.

For instance, I’d sway my hips when I walked or stand in a way that others would describe as feminine, or even my voice would occasionally refuse to stay in the lower registers where it belonged.  I could hear it in my thoughts, I could see it in my face, I could feel it in just the way I carried myself.  It was everywhere and yet nowhere.  Impossible to pin down.

Sometimes it would come out in larger ways.  I would wear women’s underwear and clothes as a little boy.  Before I even knew what sex was, I’d wear these things simply because I felt comfortable and right.  I remember playing dress up a lot and always somehow being the female character when I’d play.  When I watched TV or movies, I (still to this day) have identified with the women and girls more than the male characters.  Even as an adult, I wear women’s clothes around the house only shopping for clothing that looks comfortable rather than sexy.  I’ll stay in that outfit all day and never once have a sexual thought about it.  I wear a bra and panties under my street clothes when I go out.

Throughout my life, I’ve been in a kind of denial about these things.  But I finally now, at 26, am starting to realize that the loneliness, depression, and anxiety I’ve been plagued with for years is a symptom and not a cause.  I think back in moments in my life where I felt inadequate and thought about how things might have been better if I had just accepted who I was earlier.  I think maybe the time has come to act on this and finally be who I know I am inside.

It makes me feel everything at once.  Joy, terror, sadness, excitement.  But mostly uncertainty because I don’t know what to do now.

Which is why I’m here.  I need to talk to someone ANYONE about my life and where to go.  I’ll take any advice I can.

Hope is a terrible thing. It burns when you are enjoying the cold, it's light is blinding when all you want to do is sleep. It forces you to stand up and move when you want to lay down and die.

I have an old adage:

""Courage is not the absence of fear, courage is when you are paralyzed with terror but manage to force your feet forward.""

Hope... hope is so much worse.

 I'm a straight MtF and thus used to be gay, ive had this really awesome boyfriend who I dated through a LDR for nearly 3 years but we split up because he was conflicted with himself and ""didnt want to be gay"" but we remained in close contact since. Cut to 1 year later and i've came out as MtF to him and our group of friends, he accepts it and so do others.

 Just recently he says he wants to talk to me, and when we do he says he found out hes actually gay and just supressed it and that he was sorry for toying with me and playing with my heart n stuff like that. He says he would like to try again, and being that i was single and he held such a special place in my heart I said yes. Only issue i said was the MtF thing, and he kinda just ignored that statement, and he started talking about how he doesnt feel arousal towards women parts and stuff like that, I was nervous but i figured things would sort out soon.

 He's everything I remember him, sweet and funny, everythings great, but he keeps misgendering me and ignoring my comments about being trans, calls me his ""little gay boy"" when sexual stuff is involved. It really makes me sad but I love him so much

 He pressured me to skype and wanted me to use my ""regular voice"" not the one ive been practicing.

I dont know what to do, hes perfect to me but this stuff really hurts, the thing is I can see myself playing along with it dispite being unhappy. Any support or tips?

I'm 3 years in hrt now and while it needed some time, after 12month or so there were very markable changes and I had atleast half of the time a good passing. 24 months into hrt I passed most of the time and was really satisfied with where I got. Sadly over the last months it all broke down, to where I am now.
My passing is just miserable, my face is more ""square"" and overall masculine, I lost alot of hair, my skin isn't as soft as it was, my boobs shrinked a little, I got some tiny blonde hair over my whole body, even on places I haven't had any before hrt.
I started with 20 as an rather androgynous boy and puberty hit me a little late- even back then I passed better than now.
It's not just me, it's everyone who knows me and it's also very very obvious through photos ( I may share after work). My hormone tests were all right, only shgb was high and e2 only in the last bloodworks ( 600, but I used the gel only about a hour ago, so my endo said its nothing to worry about), testosterone was and still is very low.

So what could it be?? I got problems at work and I slowly begin to be very depressed. For over a year nobody new here and now it's so obvious. My endo hasn't any answer, as the Internet--isn't here anybody who has gone through sth similiar?

The Dysphoric Beast- by Joslynn T-H.

What is strange is the mercurial aspect of dysphoria. It consumes you, and then leaves. 

It is like a monster in the woods. You know it's there. You can hear its breathing all the time and you know it will be coming for you. 

Then it does and you have to run. 

You have to run fast and hard, because if you do not, it will eat you bit by bit. 

Piece by piece you will see what's wrong with your appearance. It will chew up a hand and make you see it's too big or too small. It will chew up your chest and you will see left over parts or the smallness of what's left. 

You will see hair so thick its fur and flesh so smooth it forces you to shudder. 

You will see its beard or lack their of on its many faces. 

What is left in its wake is broken and crying, knowing it will come again before too long and that you can only run so far. 

The Dysphoric Beast lurks and hunts and will never stop. 

It is the pain of  toothache that you can just barely ignore or the tingle of a sunburn across your flesh, making every moment you sit touching something uncomfortable. 

It's a million inconveniences and a thousand awkwardnesses. 

The worst part of all, all of its faces are your own.

171,2019-02-07 20:13:34,ao804a,8,1,"Pardon any spelling or wording wrong, mobile sucks, and my mind is racing

I came out as genderfluid in 2013, then in 2014 as ftm. Until 2016 I dressed masc and binded. 

In 2016 I started to wear feminine clothing again, grow my hair out. Wear makeup. (Those last two I never stopped doing.)

Some days, I literally look like a cis girl. This is weird because consistently since 2014 I've gone by Dan, and used he/him. My family doesnt care how I present, they call me what I want. They just ask I nicely correct if they say she bc of my looks.

And lately, Ive been being called ""transtrender,"" ""tucute"" by transmeds and what confuses me is that I have diagnosed gender dysphoria. Thats medically trans. Theyre just judging me based on how I look. I'm also told I just want to be a trans guy so when I date a man its gay bc I dont wanna be straight. I'm dating a trans man so...also I'm bi. Thats such a confusingly dumb argument. 
I dont want to discourse about this stuff. I'm just mentioning it because it gives me major dysphoria and anxiety and makes me wanna go back in the closet.
My opinion is that no one can tell anyone else their gender. Or their sexuality. Despite if you think theres requirements to be trans, you cant tell someone who they are. You're not them.

I id as nonbinary right now, I feel afraid to tell anyone my gender I align to.

I have reasons why I dress like this.

1. I feel like when I dress masc its very hard to get myself to look exactly how I want, otherwise it just gives me more dysphoria.

2. I like 'girl' things. I see people praise miles jai, Jeffery star (masc identifying people who dress feminine/similar to me daily.) yet when a man without a penis has this lifestyle/fashion...its not ok? That seems transphobic to me.

3. I literally dont want to give a fuck. My dysphoria hits me based on my natural body not being ""man enough."" Am I even fully male? Most people desire surgery and hormones for this (not saying I dont.) but the perfect scenario to kill my dysphoria would to be to accept my body as it is, that I am who I am without surgery, and change it if I desire to. (I am not judging people who need surgery to help dysphoria, im just different.)

4. This ones kinda confusing. I have DID. Dissociative identity disorder. I have more than one mental state/personality. I share my body with people of different genders, specifically my other half who is dfab and id's femininely. Even the dmab male in here dresses...in male clothes, but is very feminine. 


I'm just so tired of not knowing who I am. Gender wise and...quite literally in general. This is a battle I fight and its really not helpful to be called a ""transtrender"" or a ""confused cis girl who wants to mutilate herself to be trans"" 
It makes me want to give up and just. Idk.

Also, if there is a better subreddit to ask this question on, please direct me there. Thanks in advance. 

Also, on mobile, formatting may suck. 


A few months ago (November), I came to accept that I am trans (MtF), but I have recently (past week or so) been coming to question if I was correct in that. The biggest reasons that lead me to realizing that I was trans initially were:

1. I know I would prefer having a female body to a male one. This is especially true when it comes to sexually. 

2. In many ways, I identify better with female gender roles, such as a preference for female fashion, makeup, and others I can't think of at this moment in time

3. I am much happier when I am referred to by she/her pronouns and my new name than my ""deadname"" (more on why that's in quotes later)

4. I often fantasize about being a woman instead of a man

5. Before coming out as trans, I came out as Bi, and I struggled with accepting that as accurate for a long time, but when I accepted I was trans, I realized that a large part of *why* it was difficult for me was because I'm not nearly as Bi as I'd be if I were a woman (hard to explain, happy to expand on)


However, recently, I've been thinking about how there are definitely plenty of things where I am 100% okay with being a man - I don't actually experience any *dys*phoria in those cases. I would even argue that I can't *really* think of any times that I do experience gender dysphoria, just a preference for being the other gender in specific cases. Additionally, I am totally fine being a guy in many ways that don't really fit with my current understanding of what being MtF is. Examples follow:

1. While I may wish I had the other set of body parts instead of my current ones, I am also totally OK with what I've got. I don't hate my parts, I'd just rather have the other ones.

2. I don't dislike my ""deadname"", or being called by it. It doesn't bother me at all, though I do get upset in groups where I have repeatedly reminded people that I want to go by my new name. This is less about dead name being wrong than about just being upset when people don't call me by the handle I prefer - it's the same when I change usernames, etc

3. I don't dislike it when people who don't know the *right* pronouns use the wrong ones. If I'm called by he/him, it's totally fine most of the time.

4. If I were to fully transition, I'd probably end up dressing the same, not wearing make-up, etc, because I like the casual look, and I like the clothes I have now (they're comfortable).

5. I actually like my facial hair.

There are probably some other things that I can't remember right now.

My overall goal in this post is to ask this: with the information above, and any clarification through comments, am I right in that I am MtF, or is there another term that may better define what I am? I love the trans community so far, and I identify so well with so many people that I have had the joy of interacting with, but I don't know if MtF is right for whatever I am. And before it is asked, the reason I'm looking for a lable is because labels help summarize a certain aspect of you so that you can find others with those same feelings and dilemmas, and join communities around such.

These comments kind of stung at the time and, being more sure of myself now, were extremely invalidating in hindsight. There seems to be this lack of cohesion in the individual narratives everyone cites for their ""trans awakening"".

Now, I'm well aware of the fact that men can be feminine and women can be masculine. Even though I identify more with the concept of femininity as it applies to myself, there are also ways in which I'm more stereotypically masculine than even some of my male friends.

A strange place to consider a starting point for my journey, but it was the first time I had the real desire to be a woman. I created a female character named Arietta Phoenix and decided I wanted to roleplay not only her, but roleplay a girl playing her. So, for more than a year I lived in the game, made friends, and socialized as a woman. It was the best time I had in so many years. I felt awkward being courted by boys in game, but didn’t want to out myself or keep outright lying. So, I married my real life friend in game (the only person who knew the truth). As time went on, our guild purchased a voice over IP program and my secret was out. I lost a few friends that day because I lied about being a girl, but the fear was gone. I wished I could have stayed a girl longer.

I had to move back home for several years. After five years or so I returned to college, got my degree, and ran into the same triggers in grad school. I moved back home and became a recluse--entirely dependent on my family. I struggled with suicidal thoughts and planning for years, and I all but gave up on trying to be happy. Over that decade and a half, I occasionally wished I was a woman. I wished there were more complete transitioning methods (DNA modification, transplanting my mind, cybernetic bodies a la “Ghost in the Shell,” Genie wishes, reincarnation, being a changeling, etc.). I didn’t want to be who I was.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost never questioned that I was transgender, until I did some research on gender labels three months ago. I started the research to find out why I didn’t fit the typical male stereotype and if there was a better label for me. In the end, I realized most of my gender leans toward feminine, but I had been repressing it since I was twelve. My stepmother chided me for being too sensitive, and the fear of homophobic violence led me to repress everything. Now, all the years of wanting to be a woman made sense, because I wasn’t just curious or thought of it in a sexual way: I might be trans.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course I had doubts. I spent 35 years as a male, so why did I want to change now? I spent three months reading trans people’s stories, and almost every story had similar notes to my own. There were even many that transitioned around this age. Every time I began to deny it, I would find too much in common to be coincidence. I tested another hypothesis: perhaps I was just bigender. In the end, the desire to be a woman and not a man didn’t fit with any other labels. After exhausting every possibility, the only label remaining was trans. After a bit more irrational fighting myself about it, I accepted that I am trans.

&amp;#x200B;

I started doing what I could to feel more like a woman stealthily, which wasn’t much without money. I used my Christmas money to buy some jewelry and fell in love with it. If I was going out, I would always put on a couple bracelets and a necklace. I wanted to have more jewelry including rings. I couldn’t start makeup or change my wardrobe without serious funds. I started growing out my hair and claimed it was out of laziness. I shaved my beard because “it was itchy” (really, it made me feel gross). I wanted to get rid of a lot of my body hair, but I thought my family might notice. Oh right, my family would have to know I am trans someday.

&amp;#x200B;

I started dropping news and jokes on them to see how they react to LGBTQ+ ideology, and got a negative reaction. They’re all religious, and believe all of it is a sin. Coming out to them will likely cause a tremendous amount of stress that I can’t handle.  Before I can come out, I have to be ready to deal with the pressure or be able to leave. So I must wait for the next decision on my disability, or move into public housing without it. However, there isn’t much transitioning that can be done without an income. So I wait for my chance at independence and to begin transitioning, like many of the young trans people’s stories I studied before. I wait: not to get older, but to get stronger.

A strange place to consider a starting point for my journey, but it was the first time I had the real desire to be a woman. I created a female character named Arietta Phoenix and decided I wanted to roleplay not only her, but roleplay a girl playing her. So, for more than a year I lived in the game, made friends, and socialized as a woman. It was the best time I had in so many years. I felt awkward being courted by boys in game, but didn’t want to out myself or keep outright lying. So, I married my real life friend in game (the only person who knew the truth). As time went on, our guild purchased a voice over IP program and my secret was out. I lost a few friends that day because I lied about being a girl, but the fear was gone.

249,2019-02-10 19:52:09,ap7ly8,3,1,"So...yeah. I have a pretty confusing profile. I'm a 46 year old biological male who's insanely attracted to girls and not at all to guys. I've wanted to be a girl since around age 8 or 9 and it's never abated. I have some of the dynamics that have sometimes been associated with transgender, crossdressing etc. -- abusive upbringing, horrible relationship with father, never being validated by the opposite sex and therefore feeling no positive association with maleness (as well as always being intellectual, cerebral, analytical, artistic, sensitive, not-tall, not-fit, not into typical boy interests - all things that make boys invisible to girls). 

As a guy, I have never had a scintilla of interest in touching another guy. As a girl, I would totally be physical with guys and date and flirt and be submissive and all that...but don't know that I would ever feel compelled to have a relationship with a guy or love one. Despite my horrible fortunes with women, I've managed to have some relationships, and an exciting sexual component in a LTR with basically my dreamgirl, a gorgeous, young, smart, cool, huge-hearted Latina. She was the first person to ever make me feel attractive and halfway normal as a male...but to this day I can't really be sure that any girl has ever truly found me attractive. 

Things broke down with us financially and emotionally (my entire life has always been a trainwreck in every way), and at some point in the LTR, as a function of my dysfunction, we started playing with cuckolding -- she was super hot and lots of men in her life wanted her, and I was super turned on by hearing about her being dominated by guys who were actually attractive and dynamic and masculine. This eventually led to her hooking up with a guy who she would get pregnant by and marry within months; part of this happened because our relationship had gotten toxic and she needed escape, but I'm sure it was also incredibly sexy for her. We're actually still close and even fooled around off and on after they were married, and she's said several times that she still loves me and has never really felt it with him. Long story there and I digress. 

Point is that I've somehow had a few somewhat-functional relationships with women, and absolutely enjoyed it, but I don't really ""work"" as a guy for the most part and so have continued wanting to be a girl even when getting validated by one...and I even envy these women and fantasize about being THEM. In fact, the bulk of my sex life is masturbating while pretending to be a girl and being really girlie and submissive to guys. I've fleshed out that fantasy world by having phone sex with men (I can sound/act startlingly like a girl) or even calling girls' clothing stores and asking salesgirls with help picking out outfits for dates -- I ADORE girltalking with actual girls about all the stuff girls talk about; it feels very natural and welcome and inclusive. 

Then when this cuckolding dynamic emerged, things got really twisted -- I started not just inhabiting the role of a girl, but that of my ex-girlfriend (the one described above and then the subsequent one, who came along 8 years later in 2015...in that one there was no cheating or cuckolding, but she did move on to several new boyfriends within a couple of months of ditching me). I would tell some strange guy/phone sex partner the whole story, perhaps slightly embellished, and we'd play out scenarios stemming from things I went through, except now I was my own ex-girlfriend, and my ""ex-boyfriend"" whom I'd cuckolded and/or dumped was ""him"" (but was really me). As much as it hurt me as a guy losing my girl(s), as the girl doing the cheating and humiliating, it was hot and liberating. 

So I still really want to be a girl, but I don't necessarily feel disgusted by or incapable of living as a guy; I'm probably more disgusted living as THIS guy, the guy I am. But ultimately I do think I would be happier as a girl and that my personhood would make much more sense as a girl. Fwiw, when I talk and present as a girl over the phone, everyone I engage with (male and female) loves me and treats me so nicely. I come off as sweet and happy and girlish and I can totally hear and feel how charmed people are by me. And even though I'm not instinctively attracted to boys, I'm 100% sure that if I were able to date as a girl and have a boy treat me like a real girl he's into, I would be totally into doing all the things girls do with boys. 

I wouldn't physically transition, but I've thought quite a bit about basically living as a girl, dressing and acting and socially identifying/presenting as one. The problem with THAT is I'm very overweight and not remotely pretty or feminine-looking. If I had to have a guy want to engage with me ""despite"" my looks or butchness, it wouldn't be very fun, I don't think. But I can't go on lonely and isolated and frozen in place, and it seems like this is the time in our society's history for someone like me -- whatever the hell I am -- to feel confident and safe trying to be whatever tv v bill 0",trans,Help?,1549853529.0,"{'created_utc': 1549828329, 'id': 'ap7ly8', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'So...yeah.

To be brief, trans-identity has been explained to me in the following way: a person is born male, say, at a certain point they begin identifying as a trans-woman because they feel their behavior and disposition is primarily feminine and on the inside, so to speak, they feel like a woman. Isn't this kind of thinking in a sense anti-feminist? To say one acts in a feminine fashion, is to confirm or support stereotypes about how a woman is supposed to act, right? Wasn't the insight of the gay rights movement, say, to argue that a male or a man can be feminine and dress in clothes that are typically meant for women, but that doesn't make them any less of a man.

Hello fellow reader! My name is Ryder and I am currently 14 years old, and biologically male. I have been having cases of gender dysphoria for many years now, probably about 3 by now. I’ve had dreams about being a girl and have even worn girl things in secret. If possible I’d like to seek advice and explain my story to you all.
To start off, I grew up as someone who has been ahead of all of their peers physically. I had an early onset puberty that started at 8 or 9 years old and today I look like some 18-20 year old when really I’m only 14. I have more hair on me than my dad and my voice is VERY deep. Cutting to the chase, I hate it. I hate being a guy. I want to be a girl. I want to be a girl mainly because I could finally express who I really want to be. I no longer have to be held back by my masculinity and be expected to either take charge or act tough. To be honest, I’d much rather be a weak person who looks cute, not a person who looks overly masculine and “manly”. I’ve hurt others on complete accident because of my body, and I’ve had enough of it. I’m disgusted with what my body has become. (To give a visual for you all, it’s not ugly or anything. I’m pretty skinny and thin, and some muscle in my upper torso, but I personally don’t like the way I look.) I also don’t like my deep voice, I’d love to have a soft light voice. I’ve also trained my voice to partially speak higher pitched, but it doesn’t always work well.
I’ve told my closest friends about this, and they’ve supported me, but by now it doesn’t feel like they do. To me, it feels like they’re toying with me when it comes to it. My friends are finding it irritating or questioning it when they know it’s true. It makes me get really depressed. One of them though is pretty relaxed on the matter and supports me, heck, I’d say I’ve actually sort of fallen for him now (not because of that though). But he’s already got a GF so that won’t really work. I just feel feminine and have started to act a little more feminine than usual.
I’ve wanted to tell my parents, but my dad is scary and his view on the trans community isn’t the greatest. He’s even forced me to change outfits several time because they look to “feminine” or “non-manly”, and has even harassed me over “gender rules” because I said something about it he disagreed with. You have no idea how many times I’ve wanted to hit him, but of course, I won’t, it’s his opinion but he’s trying to force on me it seems. Screw being manly, let me be who I want to be!
My dream is to become a girl named Ryleigh and become a female Artist, mainly art in the anime department of things. Artists like Kamiya Yuu (No Game, No Life) and Sayori (Nekopara) for example. I’m pretty skilled as it is in it and maybe hope to produce a novel series or even contribute to a game series with my artwork. 
I also want to be a girl because...I’m scared to be a guy. Ever since the #MeToo movement started some women have been taking advantage of that and have been framing famous men for stuff they haven’t done. Don’t get me wrong, I will support those who speak out, but whether I’ll believe you or not depends on if your lying or being truthful. I don’t want it be a grown man who makes a famous series then gets accused of something I never did. I’d have my career ruined and everything for something falsely made up! This is only a minor factor though, I really don’t wanna grow up as a guy anymore.
To sum all of this up, I want to be a girl because of past experiences as a guy, gender dysphoria factors, and wanting to be the real me. I’m held back by social norms and cannot escape the bubble society has placed me in. I’ve had lots of time to think about this, and I had reached this decision about a month ago after 3 years of deep thinking and depression. 

I don’t want to put all the details (I missed a lot after reading over it) down just because it would take me probably and hour or two to right everything down. I’ll end it here and just post this.

302,2019-02-12 20:39:08,apxy0y,0,1,"Hello, here is my most recent advice for changing name and gender marker specifically in WA State (could likely be easily adapted to other states, especially the info for SSA and Passport as those are federal services)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 

Start by gathering a few initial forms:

1. A name change petition [(link for adult)](https://www.kingcounty.gov/~/media/courts/DistrictCourt/pdfs/petnc.ashx?la=en)
   1. On this petition there will be a reason for name change, a great option is “It more accurately represents who I am”
2. A Social Security Name Change Request Form [(link)](https://www.ssa.gov/forms/ss-5.pdf)
   1. On this form in box 8, mark your correct sex, not the one assigned at birth
3. Change of Gender Designation Request for the Dept. of Licensing [(link)](https://www.dol.wa.gov/forms/520043.pdf)
4. An Application for US Passport, if applicable [(link)](https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds11.pdf)
   1. You need an application for a new passport, not renewal, regardless of if your current passport is valid or not; because you’re changing information

Ok, now, before you even start filling out forms, send your doctor an email. Unfortunately to change your gender marker you must receive “appropriate clinical treatment” which is defined as “Your physician determines what appropriate clinical treatment is according to acceptable medical practices, standards and guidelines, and certifies that you have had appropriate clinical treatment for transition to either male or female. Surgery is not a requirement to get a U.S. passport.” The doctor who writes this letter **must be an M.D. or O.D.**

A sample email to send your doctor is:

“Hello ***Dr.’s Name***,

I am writing to request the writing of a letter to change my sex marker on my Passport. Attached below the template for it from the Dept. of State website. Just for your recollection, I have been taking ***Drug One Name*** (currently: ***Dosage*** mg/day) and ***Drug Two Name*** (currently: ***Dosage*** mg/day) for approximately ***Total Time on Medications***. Also if it's needed, I attached my most recent blood work. ***(If you have it)***

For your reference I have copied and pasted the following from the Dept. of State:

Medical Certification

A signed, original statement from a licensed physician must be on office letterhead and include:

* Physician’s full name, address, and telephone number
* Medical license or certificate number
* Issuing state or other jurisdiction of medical license/certificate
* Language stating that:
   * He or she has treated you, or has reviewed and evaluated your medical history
   * You have had appropriate clinical treatment for transition to male or female, or are in the process of transition to male or female
* The statement must include, “I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States that the foregoing is true and correct.”
* Medical certification requirements are the same for a minor as an adult.

Your physician determines what appropriate clinical treatment is according to acceptable medical practices, standards and guidelines, and certifies that you have had appropriate clinical treatment for transition to either male or female. Surgery is not a requirement to get a U.S. passport. 

Thank you so much!” 

Also attach [this template](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/passports/content-page-resources/Physician%20Letter%20Example3.docx) with any blood work you have.

Now it’s the exciting day! Name change day!!

1. Find out what time name change petition must be filed with the court clerk and head to the courthouse with some time to spare, the only 3 things you need are:
   1. Name Change Petition filled out
   2. Current ID with soon to be legally dead name
   3. $207 in **cash**
   4. Note that courthouses are secured places, you will go through a metal detector and bags through an X-ray, so don’t bring anything you wouldn’t take on a plane.
2. File your petition, pay the fee (**this must be done with cash**) ask clerk for 3 copies
3. Hang out till the hearing. (If you’re going to the King County Courthouse in Seattle there’s a public law library on the 6th floor that is a great place to wait
4. Go to your hearing at the appropriate time and stand before the judge, nothing to stress about, they will likely ask no questions other than confirming you’re not doing this to commit fraud.
5. Smile like a giddy school child and thank the judge and the clerk will hand you the 3 copies of the court order to change your name.

Next, you must pick up the letter from your doctor’s office, and while you’re there, ask them to sign off on the DOL Change of Gender Designation Request.

From here you’ll go off to the Social Security Office, take with you:

1. An original of the court order to change your name
2. The Passport (yes, passport) letter from your doctor to change your gender
3. Current ID (yes, it will still have your dead name on it)

There is no fee for this filing, just the 3 hours of your life you’ll spend at the SSA. I recommend going right when they open, and the one at Aurora and 135th is much faster and more pleasant.

Now, go to the DOL, again, not the downtown one, or it will take forever. You will need:

1. A current ID
2. The Court Order to change your name
3. The Change of Gender Designation Request, completed by you and your doctor
4. The fee’s are crazy and hard to understand, I’d recommend getting an Enhanced ID it will either be about $24 or $113, depending on how much longer you have until your current license expires
5. To get all spruced up if you’d like for your new license photo (just remember your hair will have to be out of your eyes)
6. While you’re all spruced up you might as well swing by Walgreens and get your passport photos done (for $16.50)

Next you go off to the Passport Authority and take:

1. A Court Order to change your name
2. Application for a U.S. Passport
3. Passport photos
4. The Passport letter from your doctor to change your gender
5. This will likely cost $165, I have no idea what lowers the cost, though the website say’s $0-165

Congratulations! With these documents you should be able to change your name everywhere you need!

Costs:

Court Ordered Name Change

$207

New License

$113

Passport Photos

$16.50

Passport

Total

312,2019-02-13 07:37:50,aq44iy,19,1,"but I'm a straight man not driven by a fetish or a preference.  The odds that I encounter a trans woman with the right personality before meeting a cisgender woman of equal appeal are slim.  I find trans women potentially appealing because of how their struggle likely refined the value they place on a relationship and the acceptance they receive.  My own personality is half as rare as transgenderism, so I'm not a complete stranger to alienation and a sense of rejection, and my two marriages have been with toxic cisgender women.  I can't imagine surviving a third under those terms.

I'm principled and completely burnt out on drama.  Hook-ups have no appeal to me.  Sex is a distant secondary interest to a quality relationship.  Otherwise, I doubt a transgender woman would be my preference.

I'm focused on college and my son.  I'm not exactly in a rush for a new relationship.  I'm still recovering from my last marriage, which did not end in divorce only because my wife passed from cancer first.  Trans women were not on my radar screen until I met one online with a very compelling personality, and I did some serious soul searching as a result.

I am putting this out here as food for thought.  You can call straight men transphobic all day long and change nothing.  Gender constructs can be nuked completely and nothing will change.  Straight men are attracted to female bodies, female gender, or a combination of the two.  I discovered, my attraction is by far to the female gender.  To even consider a trans woman could make me pan I guess, but that's ok.  Straight is the better description.  Pass-ability is likely nearly essential, but perhaps a strong and developed gender identity can overcome more than I imagine.  I have no personal experience to base it on.

Regardless, I'm happy to be an ally, and it just may be by becoming active locally for the community I meet a ciswoman ally who's support for the community reveals she has the character I seek.  

I can't stress enough that people don't seek out identities for partners.  They seek out people who they are attracted to and can fall into love with.  There are amazing transgendered people who have progressed in their transitions and emerged as remarkable people.  I encourage everyone to purpose to reach that point and be careful about becoming hardened against people.  No one will ever know who you are if you lose yourself along the way.  Community and support are awesome and necessary, but to find love at some point you have to do you.

I'm not trans, and I have never questioned my gender, but I have just finished a paper analyzing an argument made by a brilliant trans man, and he completely demonstrated the power of finding a real purpose for his writing and his approach.  That is the wisdom I am passing on when I seem to counter popular sentiment at times.  I care about you all as people and the community comes by default.  I also bring the perspective of a good person once opposed ignorantly but innocently to the broad acceptance you seek.  Please take this to heart.  There's more to accomplishing what you seek than just ""us verses them.""

Anyway, the prospect of being essentially a miracle to someone vs just another relationship is appealing, but with more time for those thoughts to settle, I find little interest in attempting to make it happen.  There doesn't really seem to be a promising way to pursue such a relationship with these motives anyway.  Personality can impact how I view someone's appearance but appearance has no bearing on how I view someone's personality.  So I encourage anyone who's seeking someone with something other than a fetish to resist being defined by rejection and to determine instead to be true to themselves in every fresh encounter.  Let the people you meet reveal who they are and ignore the odds that would prevent you from ever having a chance to know when you meet the person who is different.  There is nothing about me that would suggest I would respect a transgender person.  I'm a conservative Christian who lives in the country with guns, tractors, and chainsaws.  I'm not surprised getting to know someone transformed my opinion on the issue, but the passion has been a complete surprise.  The next person you meet could have the same ally potential.

One more thing.  You aren't all the same.  Some of you are indeed women born into the wrong body and vice versa, but not all.  There are others who are much closer to the predominant cis perspective of the entire community.  Your experiences will be unique and so will your appeal, especially to straight people.  It's all the more reason to be true to yourself and to guard against a self-defeating perception of the dating pool.

Some are of less importance that it wouldn't be too concerning to a Doctor(ie. RBC counts for gals is between 4.0-5.5million/uL, guys is between 4.5-6.0million/uL). Others are significant.  For example: a positive ""pregnancy test"" for a birth female means they're pregnant, where a positive Beta-HCG(pregnancy test) for a birth male means they probably have testicular cancer.  When trauma victims are given uncrossmatched blood, women(of child bearing age, 0-50 years old) are given Rh-negative blood so there is no risk of them developing antibodies to the D-antigen found on Rh-positive donor red cells(development of anti-D can cause serious disease of future pregnancies.  It used to be one of the main causes of gestational and newborn mortality).  Men are given Rh-positive blood in a trauma because they don't have a uterus.

I sometime went on reddit because I saw a lot of wonderful posts and saw good advices or heartwarming stories, but today I need to share something and I hope you could give me answers.


First of all I'm a 30 years old French that use to consider herself as a trans woman.
Since my childhood I always knew I was a girl, I loved to share secrets with my girl friends and felt so well with them. I'm also very feminine in my way of talking or in the general manners. And for nearly every activities I was really attracted to girl things. I heard about the real thing at 13 and it all made sense. I just knew it.

Also I'm romantically pansexual but when it comes to sex I think I'm really attracted to men. I was kind of impatient to make a transition but for some financial and professional reasons I decided to wait again and again... maybe too much.

Also I'm feeling not that bad with my body of course I would largely prefer a woman's body but it's kind of ""ok"" I guess. The only hard pain I've got is that I know I would never be pregnant. But, well I'm not the only one... Well that was about me.


Anyway, here is my bad experience :

I do not live in a big city or in a very ""open"" place, so I'm not in contact with people like me. Hopefully my best friend is a amazing girl that happens to be lesbian, so it is the only person I can really talk to and she's very great. But I wanted to know more people like me so I looked on Google and found a transgender group on a 2h roadtrip from my place.

I went there saturday and I'm heartbroken since. First of all the fact that I was dressed in totally casual clothes and that I had short hair seems to have atracted strange looks. I personally think that they all seemed amazing, all 5 of them were at least on HRT and looked really great. I was in admiration in front of all that courage.

They talked a bit and then it was my turn. I told them about my feelings. They asked me about my dysphoria and I told them that luckily I had none. This created some kind of strange atmosphere, I think one of them laughed at me at that point. Then one of them asked what I was doing there, and if I was sure I was at the good place. I just didn't know what to say. Finally a second one told me that I shouldn't consider myself trans because I was androgynous. And the first one did let a muffled laughter.
I NEVER felt so bad in my entire life. I just stood and left. I cried all the way home. I'm kind of depressed since.

Firstly background
She has been my friend for my whole life (19 years, she's twenty two) and let's say our childhood was, difficult. My father commited suicide when I was seven and I went moved about 21 times until I was seventeen, as a result I only kept her as any form of friendship throughout my life. Her life was probably even shittier, her parents had an extremely rocky relationship until the got a divorce when she was 14(?) And she tried to kill herself when she was eight. Roughly a year before my dad.

So, the main problem I'm facing is that she has told literally everyone in my personal life that she is trans, from my mother to my girlfriend. All before me, and I only first met my girlfriend three years ago. I have been told that she is afraid to tell me, and I do defintely get that, it is terrifing to imagine the concept of your bestfriend hating you for who you are, but I feel that this secret is going to burn inside of her until there is nothing left.

So I was hoping to get your guy's input on the matter, I was thinking of getting her to a private place (like her house) and gently bring up the topic that I know she is trans?

512,2019-02-22 18:31:49,atl1yw,4,7,"Hi,

I'm 3 years in hrt and this is not the first time I bring this up- sadly I was mostly ignored in the forums or here on reddit when I asked and my endo just told me “well uhm, yeah, this just happens sometimes, you know? genetics blabla"", he also told me e1/ e2 balance doesnt matter at all and never tested me on both, just on total estrogen.
I havent got the worst passing, but sadly it depletes. My face and overall my body appears harder, because of loss of subcutaneous fat tissue, my breasts shrinked a little, my hair thinned and I have little blonde hairs all over my body. vellus, not terminal hair most likely, but still they werent there before.

I was a rather feminine boy before transition, even kinda androgynous and so the first year of hrt nearly granted me a 100% of passing. but this changed sadly and mostly bc of my face, when I dont have make up on, I started to have been recognized as a trans quute often and this just got more over time.
I was on 6mg of estradiol pills ( sadly I  havent gotten these, you can take sublingually) and my estrogen levels still always were very low. so he switched me to gel, from which I had normal to high levels  last time I was tested even super high levels ( 3 times the recommended), so he lowered my dose. ( still I took the gel only about 2 hours before the bloodwork)
I was on 100mg of spirinolactone for most of the time and switched to 10mg of cypro recently, because I got regular headaches.

I also had an opiate addiction and got methadone for a few months, now 4mg of buprenorphine. beside of that I dont smoke, dont drink, eat a very healthy pescetarian diet and am quite active. my endo also means, that opiates could affect hormonal levels in cis people, as they alter the gonade axis, but in trans people with their exogen hormones that'd be highly unlikely. sadly there isnt any proper research about this to compare.
my thyroid also seems to be ok.

what could this possibly be? 😔

I, a bisexual cis woman, love him so much. He’s my whole world and I plan on spending the rest of my life with him. I’d love nothing more than to see him blossom into the person he really is after years of confusion. I want to support him every step of the way. 

That said, I have to admit I am devastated. I fell in love with this rugged, bearded, broad shouldered man and to me, his body is perfection. He already started to remove hair and wear dresses sometimes around the house, he’s an ABSOLUTE cutie but with every step he takes towards full transition, my heart breaks a little bit. I feel like I’m losing this beautiful man piece by piece and it’s so hard eventho this other part of me is extremely proud of him and finds him absolutely beautiful. 

I don’t know who to talk to about how I feel, I really do not want to interfere with his transition, i don’t want him to feel guilty. I feel like he doesn’t need to hear the devastating emotions I’m going through cause he already has more than enough on his plate. I feel like crying almost all the time and I feel absolutely horrible for feeling anything else than positive emotions about this. I’m also so scared of how it’s all gonna affect our sex life... He already has little to no sex drive these days and, this is just a guess, but I think he’s not always comfortable with using his penis but he doesn’t want to tell me... He’s really interested in HRT and I have no idea if that’ll just kill his sex drive. (I basically know next to nothing about HRT. Feel free to educate me!) 

I’d love to hear other people that lived through a similar experience. how you dealt with the situation without forgetting about your own well being, who to talk to, how to support him better etc... any advice is welcome. I just wanna be a great supporting partner but I’m scared I’m gonna loose myself trying to stay strong.

I’m starting to feel really cosy feelings around him. For example tonight I switched round the side of the sofa I was on so I could be physically closer to him. I felt chemistry and sexual tension between us but I’m not sure if it was just me.

I seriously think I am in love with him, I miss him when he’s gone and think about him all the time but I am so scared of ruining the friendship as he is my best friend, if he didn’t feel he same way.

578,2019-02-25 02:57:41,aug2r9,7,1,"First of all, I am not transgender, but my younger brother is. 
He told my family this from a very young age and is currently (10+ years later) almost fully transitioned to male. 

I mention this because I believe that growing up with him has given me a fair amount of exposure and (indirect) experience with the topic.
He does share this question with me.


That said - I simply cannot understand how one can claim to be transgender without experiencing gender dysphoria. 

My brother’s trans status is defined by dysphoria, the feeling that his body is not his. There are/were obvious sex characteristics: breasts, a vulva, feminine bone structure, etc. that did not align with the wiring of his brain and the resulting masculine view he had of himself. 

These feelings are understandably accompanied by the desire to be seen as and addressed as a male - with the socially accepted male name and pronouns.

He does wear typically masculine clothing, a shorter haircut and enjoys more stereotypically masculine things (like sports and video games) - BUT so do many women!!

This is why I believe it’s problematic to call this last facet “gender expression.” Without the sexual dysphoria, I would have a tomboyish sister. This label of gender expression as an aspect of being transgender just seems to further the divide of socially enforced gender roles.

Which is why I can’t comprehend what would prompt a person to identify as transgender without experiencing dysphoria.

What inspires someone to identify as a man without the desire for male anatomy? How can you separate lifestyle from anatomy?

Why would one desire to be “seen” as a male with pronouns etc. without also feeling they should have the body of a male?

^these apply to both/all genders.

Some have said the problem with this view is that it’s “gatekeeping” the trans community or telling someone you know their gender better than they do.

I have no intention of doing this at all! But biologically and scientifically, I just don’t get how it’s really valid?

Thanks! :)

588,2019-02-25 17:03:25,aunh5r,8,7,"Hi! Not trans or nb at all, but just curious.

The definition of transgender that I see used the most is that they are a person who identifies as a gender that they were not assigned at birth. There are a lot of people I see who identify as nonbinary but I am almost certain that no one is assigned nb at birth, it is something that they come to identify with and eventually declare themselves. 
I always see the word trans applied to mtf or ftm trans identities but no other types of genders, specifically nb, despite the fact that nb is a gender identity that an individual was not assigned at birth. 

why is that? Is there a difference between being born female and eventually identifying as nb, as opposed to being born female and eventually identifying as male? Is one more trans than the other?

Thanks for any clarification! 
Also, I dont mean to offend or invalidate anyone, I'm just genuinely curious.

640,2019-02-27 08:32:34,avb6oc,0,7,"i (mtf) have wanted to transition for a while. i first met a transgender person in my freshman year and it like, clicked. then i realized how much dysphoria i had, and realizing it made it worse, and i've struggled with it for four years now. but, during my senior year, i met this girl. she told me she'd date me if i transitioned and told me all these nice things.

but this is a story about me not coming out, so uh, she lied. a week in i basically, out of fear of losing this girl, who i love deeply, decided to silence myself. i struggled to keep my personality and mannerisms in check (everyone always pins me as a gay guy because of how i act and talk aha) and like. i just kept it down and tried to pretend i was ok being a boy. thus followed the most suicidal times i ever had since i realized i wanted to be a girl. i'd already came out to all of my close friends, so because of this girl, i felt uncomfortable talking to my friends and made her and my very closest friend into my entire support system. this was because i felt like, if i talked to people who knew i was trans and would talk to me supportively about being trans, i'd have a harder time surpressing it, and it was like cheating to me. looking back i was mentally destroying myself. i never pictured myself going to prom in a suit, or not coming out my senior year, and now i worry that i'm not trans enough. all of the thoughts running through my head lately have been this worry that i'm a trender or whatever.
and i'm not sure where that comes from because i have dysphoria with my chest, my face/head, and with my er, dick, and also major social dysphoria, but i just keep thinking i'm not valid enough idk.

I see trans stuff on the news and like... it's great that it's getting more coverage, but we're always represented as a strange, alien thing that should be studied. Is that just me that notices that? Even positive coverage has a lot of this. It feels like everything I do becomes politics and that I can't exist without being an activist of some sort. I just want to live a normal life, not be flooded with questions and considered some strange animal or smth. 

I have so much internalised transphobia. I feel terrible about it, but I can't stop it. I never wanted this but now I'm stuck in this situation I hate. Don't get me wrong, we have a wonderful and vibrant community and I want the best for my trans siblings. I'm always excited to offer advice and help out, but there's a toxic branch, is there not?

I'm talking about tucutes who insist on using ""spivak"" as a pronoun. We just want to live, be normal, and some people, desperate for attention insist on dragging us down cause they think it's cool. 

I digress a bit with this, but I gotta know if other people feel it too:  I've been on reddit for a while, but avoided trans and LGBT safe spaces deliberately. I've always veered away from community. I go to pride, I'm not ashamed of who I am, but I don't want it to define me. I don't want to be a snowflake but I find myself questioning whether or not things are offensive. I feel the need to push back against transphobia I see, but I don't want to be labelled an SJW, and I don't want the abuse that results from it. People watch their mouths around me cause sometimes I'll jokingly say ""that's homophobia"" but because I'm trans they expect me to tear their heads off for every mistake; I do not. I am very chill and ignore most shit, even getting misgendered (mainly cause I don't wanna cause a fuss, especially if it's someone I won't see again)

I'm feeling like shit and didn't know where to put this. I'm sure I'll lose a fuck ton of karma, but alas, whatever. If you disagree with me, call me out!

I’m the lead for the LGBTQ+ inclusion network at my workplace and a trans employee recently brought up her concerns to me about the lack of policies on transgender employees. While HR was supportive and respectful, they basically just asked her what she needed instead of being proactive. 

Today I brought it to the attention of a very senior gay executive. The Ontario Human Rights Commission states workplaces should have guidelines and policies in place *before* an employee approaches them. 

Does anyone have any experience with this and have any advice I should be aware of going forward?

3,2019-02-06 01:18:52,anl947,2,1,"Hi! I’m 20 years old, and a few years ago, I started to question my gender identity; however, i quickly brushed it off as “just a thought” or “low body image” and tried to push the thoughts down. It was something I didn’t have the time or energy to think about, and it wasn’t something I /wanted/ to think about. 

It’s been some years though, and the thoughts still persist. There are many days where I feel fine as a female! I’ll feel content dressing and presenting feminine, being called she/her, and I’ll feel good and happy about my body and any clothes that might show it off. 

There are also many days, however, where I feel uncomfortable with the she/her pronouns and my feminine presentation. I’ll feel uncomfortable with my breasts and wish they weren’t there, going so far as to try to squish them down or hide them with baggy clothes. I’ll hate the length of my hair, the femininity of my face, and ultimately feel uncomfortable at the thought of going to classes because I don’t want to be seen as I am. 

I never know what kind of day it will be when I wake up, and I honestly wish I had more of an androgynous face/haircut/body so that maybe I’d feel a bit happier in my skin? 



I’m not quite sure how to interpret these feelings though. Any advice?

When writing about this, it feels stupid, because I know that gender is a construct and whatnot, but I also don't really feel like a member of the lgbq community because, even though I identify as queer, I don't really know enough queer people to say that I feel like I belong. I often feel like I would very much like to be a woman. I'm attracted to women, but the idea of being a woman and being with a woman as a woman (if that makes sense) is incredible. I don't really know how to explain this intense desire I have. I'm sorry this is so rambly, but I've never really tried to write about it or talk about it at length before.

I guess I'm curious as to how I can look more androgynous, and how to feel comfortable doing it. I live in NYC, so no one but me really gives a shit what I look like, but I still have this pervasive sense of what's probably homophobia whenever I want to do something outside of my comfort zone. I paint nails now, which is nice, and I hate when they're unpainted, and I want to get more into makeup. My partner is super supportive and encourages me to wear her clothes and things like that, but my silhouette ends up being so clearly masculine that I hate it. No curves!

Can anyone relate to what I'm saying? I feel like I'm not queer enough, as though it's something that has to be earned. Almost like I'm not allowed to be trans, although I believe pretty firmly I'm not. I think, ideally, I'd want to switch between man and woman at will, but obviously that's not possible. I don't know.

I have been browsing through various subs and have found some articles talking about how it is important to help young men assert their ""masculinity"".
I wonder if there was the same for women, such camps to help you """"connect"""" with a ""feminine identity"" and it got me wondering.

What is all this about? 

Because first of all, what is feminity/masculinity?

All I have seen are some extreme stereotypical views on it (for the feminine side for instance: ""if you want to feel feminine, put make up on, it helps"")
And found it really thought provoking.

Because afterall, it means that in our research for understanding who we are we try to put on labels this ""binary"" world agrees on, but that are terribly unclear!

I found it disturbing and felt the urge to share it with some people, because I am curious to see what you all think of it.

Have you read some good articles about it?

What is your point of view?

So, Jeff here has always considered himself straight. He's definitely attracted to women, but funnily enough, never dated one. He's dated two afab nonbinary people though, one transmasc though not ftm, and one was more femme. Additionally, I'm afab and agender. He's never dated a trans woman but he wouldn't rule it out, and he finds some of them attractive, given that he's into women. He's not into trans men or cis men. Not sure on his stance on amab enbys, though he made a passing comment of ""they're cute"" about one I dated if that counts for anything.

He's honestly quite the ally. Incredibly spportive of his LGBT+ pals, and I have no doubts when he says that he he sees trans men as men, trans women as women, and nonbinary people as, well, nonbinary, that he's 100% sincere.

Now here's what the post is about again of course. He isn't pan, he doesn't feel like identifying as bi fits him, but he doesn't feel right claiming to be straight either given his attraction to and relationships with nonbinary people. He's not a chaser or anything either. He considered himself heteroflexible for awhile, but dropped that because he thought no one would take him seriously.

So, I've been dating this guy for a month now, and I adore him to pieces. He is one of the best people i've ever dated and i see myself being with him for ages.

3 weeks in i did end up telling him I was nonbinary, and he said he didn't judge me for it and fully wanted to support me even if he didn't understand it fully.

The thing is, I know he does still see my as mainly a woman, not because he's being disrespectful but just because I am pretty feminine in features and he jusr doesn't understand nb.

61,2019-02-12 15:29:19,apugaa,7,1,"Hi. New account for obvious reasons.

I’m AMAB, he/him, 32 years old (a little late to be looking into this, I know), but I’ve never really identified strongly as male. I’m fine with it, I guess, but I don’t really fit the stereotypical mold. I’m a total beta male - shy, introverted, self-deprecating, empathetic, and without any of the cockiness, aggression, or toxic masculinity you see in many guys. I don’t like to speak out or call attention to myself, and I’m much more a follower than a leader. I don’t like to make waves or be in your face.

I don’t have any body dysphoria, but if I were suddenly transformed to have a woman’s body, I’d neither freak out nor rejoice - I’d be more like “Welp, guess I need to buy new clothes…” and move on with my life, without much having changed. I guess I feel towards my own sex like the Neutrals from Futurama - “I have no strong feelings one way or the other”

If I had to go back and pick from the binary choices, I’d probably pick male again, but not because of identity, more for perks like male privilege, better treatment in my occupation (computer programming), and actually having pockets in my clothes.

I’m fine with male secondary characteristics. I have no desire to take on a more gender neutral appearance, even in private. I lift weights and have a fairly fit body that I’m happy with.

In terms of orientation, I’m mostly straight, maybe 1.5 on the Kinsey scale. Low sex drive, often submissive, and I like cuddles as much as sex. Porn is a turn off when there isn’t an emotional connection - a ton of porn is downright abusive, but that’s a topic for another time.

I’ve taken a few online quizzes. One said cisgender. One said agender. One said my brain was ever so slightly on the male side of neutral.

For a while I was questioning if I was genderqueer or nonbinary or genderfluid maybe, or trans, idk, something that's not entierley ""girl"" or cis, and then it just stopped. I didn't care anymore and when I'd imagine myself with a male body I'd think,""No, I don't want that, I'm a girl. I'm cis and that's how I genuinely feel."" but now I'm questioning again. I don't know why. And now I'm thinking I'm genderfluid or something like that again.

Tbh I;m worried I just look like I'm making a mockery out of LGBT+ people, because everytime I think about it, it's not in an identity way, it's more like in a fun way??? Like,""Oh, that'd be fun, but I'm still cis"" like seriously, if I had the ability to switch sexes, I think that'd be cool, and I feel like I would wanna do it all the time but still have ""girl"" as my identity and only identity??? Maybe I'm just a stupid wanabe crossdress or crossdreamer or whatever and I'm just being an idiot??? idfk. I feel so stupid typing this out, like the answer is obvious and I'm just being a moron.

The only real consistency I feel with questioning all this  is that I don;t like my genitals. I mean like I'm fine with it but when I think about their purpose, it just feels...wrong??? Like I think I would like having a penis better than a vagina, like it just feels right in my mind. Honestly I feel like I only wish I had a penis when I'm aroused (which is rare honestly) and other than that, I don't care what I have. Then again I'm 19 and never masturbated or had sex so idfk what I'm talking about probably. My sexual fantasies about being a cute anime twink boy so yeah, my idea of sex is wrong and stupid. That was embarrassing to type.

80,2019-02-14 02:45:48,aqeyms,2,1,"(Okay so I tried posting this to r/asktransgender and it was downvoted almost immediately. Guess I'll try here instead.)

Talking about my gender has always been kind of an awkward subject for me because I guess I was never sure anyone would take me seriously. Furthermore, I don't totally agree with gender roles or labels, because the definitions of what is masculine and what is feminine always seemed arbitrary to me. And yet, I looked at what was considered ""masculine"", and concluded that even though there were some things I like about myself that I would consider such, by and large I don't really identify with it. I emotionally relate more closely with women, and on the inside I feel soft, sensitive, and feminine. Now that I've started digging into some of those feelings, I've realized I am much more comfortable expressing myself that way. Really though, I would rather just be able to express myself as whatever the hell I feel like. I'm told that's called gender-fluidity, which I have sometimes identified with in certain spaces, but I still formally identify as a male because it's easier to understand than whatever the hell I am.

I was towards the end of my high school career when I got to really understanding myself and my gender in this way. It was about the same time I started to experiment with wearing women's clothing. I've been doing it for long enough now that I have a small repository of women's clothing that I would either wear in my privacy or in the company of my best friend, who herself has gone a long way in helping me explore myself, helping me pick out clothes and letting me paint my toenails. When I dress up, I'll stay dressed up for a while, and then regret having to change back into my regular wear because it doesn't feel as comfortable. I don't dress up for very long or very often, partially because I'm usually not alone for long enough to dress up in my own space, and I only get to see my friend once every few months. The other reason is that it feels taboo, like I'm not supposed to be doing this because I'm physically a man and I wouldn't go out like this normally. I have taken measures to try and quash this feeling, including going to sleep in my women's clothes or posting pictures of myself in women's clothes on social media. It all seems in vain.

In terms of my physical appearance, I already have an established personal style; sort of an emo crossed with grunge look that I'm mostly content with. I would describe this appearance as masculine. And yet at the same time, I have this vision of myself as a lady that I'm obsessed with, and I've spent nights dreaming about it. It makes me feel insecure about my body, being that I have a very large upper build, facial hair and body hair that I neglect to shave at regular intervals, large hands and feet, and a noticeable belly (I'm not exactly the spitting image of health). It makes me feel like I could never achieve the feminine appearance I desire. I will look at images of other women and feel envious of their appearances. I struggled with basic self-care for a very long time because I felt so terribly about my body. I've seriously considered hormone replacement therapy. I don't consider any of these feelings to be actual dysphoria because I don't think I'm trans, though I could be wrong. Either way, I very much want to see myself as a woman in the same way I've seen myself as a man.

Truth be told, my growth was stunted for a long time because I never saw myself as ""good enough"" to challenge accepted definitions. I'm twenty years old now, and I only came out to my parents about all of the things about a month ago. I did so in hopes that I wouldn't have to feel ashamed of myself anymore. And now I'm actively working with my therapist to help me explore my feminine side. The more I dig into it, the more I feel like I could actually be transgender. And though maybe I'm expecting change to happen faster than it actually will, I'm still struggling to make it happen, and I would like to know what I can do to achieve congruence with my gender. I've been told that it's remarkable that I have such a deep understanding of myself given my age, but I could never really be sure if what I'm feeling is real. Whatever I am, I would like to rest assured that these feelings are valid and not something I've manufactured. I swear I'm not trying to run away from myself, I'm just trying to be myself.

However, I am really having a hard time knowing when I need to get very serious with people in a profession or public situations. I think the big thing is being called sir...... I live in the south, so I don\'t know if I should cut my loses here. This has really been on my mind lately as I am really becoming more out and expressive of my identity. So my question is, what is the best way to react when people are dismissive to my identity and what are ways I can get them to properly identify me?

I was born female and given a very feminine name that has no chance of being slightly altered to male (like going from Victoria to Victor or Nicole to Nicholas). It's also a name that does not have a shortened version, like Sam for Samantha or Liz for Elizabeth. I grew up hating the color pink and refusing to wear dresses, but enjoyed painting my nails and keeping my hair long.

&amp;#x200B;

Hitting puberty was a tough time for me. I hated the boobs that grew in, but my period didn't feel wrong. Perhaps I hated the attention I got from my growing chest, or maybe it's because I was the first in my class to start developing and I wasn't confident. I honestly have no idea, even today. Not once have I ever thought ""I don't belong in this body"" or ""I don't like being called 'she,'"" but I do remember wearing 4 training bras at once, hoping that my breasts would stop growing, and being insulted by the word ""girly.""

There are other days when I'll wake up and feel unhappy until I have my binder on and have my hair shoved into a beanie. On a daily basis, I wear men's jeans and boxer-briefs regardless of what I wear on top, but I've never once had the desire to have male genitals. I wear makeup and nail polish regardless if I'm presenting more masculine or feminine. I find myself dreaming of a gender neutral name, and being very jealous that my extremely stereotypically feminine sister has one instead of me.

122,2019-02-19 17:18:24,ascry1,0,0,"Turned into a very long post so tldr: the title.

I'm currently in a diversity class and the idea that ""gender is not connected to biology"" came up as a set fact. I am a math-minded person so I was wondering what proof of this was there. I was not able to ask in class as it ended soon after.

But doing some quick proofs in my head, here was my best counterexample of this statement.

Lets start off with the premise that gender is not affected by sex at all. A premise I do not completely agree with, as the statistics are incredibly close on whether it beats the p-value, but I can safely ignore this notion in my proof.

We also know/assume that people do not choose their gender consciously, we identify as a certain gender, and it cannot be changed, otherwise people who are transgendered would not be facing the problems they do. (That may have come out wrong, if it did I apologize)

But if gender is not chosen, it has to be ingrained in us somehow. And the best answer for that is that it is ingrained in us biologically, part of our body. 

We already have scientific evidence that homosexuality can be tied to biology, how much testosterone or estrogen the person is given in the womb, as well as some data linked to it being genetic as well.

So it would make sense if something similar occurs with gender.

I of course understand that a lot comes down to a nature vs nurture argument, but most people agree that a person is built by both.

So the idea the gender is not linked to biology in any way is preposterous to me. It is almost certainly linked, perhaps not completely, but there is a link.

Can anyone explain to me how or if I am incorrect?

Also I would post this to r/lgbt but they banned me a while ago with no explanation.",genderqueer,How is gender not connected to Biology?,1550621904.0,"{'created_utc': 1550596704, 'id': 'ascry1', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'Turned into a very long post so tldr: the title.\n\nI\'m currently in a diversity class and the idea that ""gender is not connected to biology"" came up as a set fact.

First time posting here and I hope this an okay place and okay thing to ask.

So as said title asks I'm debating my gender. For the longest time I've always just said female. I'm AFAB. And I am female identifying. But at the same time? Since I was tiny, I always always alwayssss have been more of a tomboy and always hated gender norms.

Anyways fast forward to me now, I'm 25. I havent changed really. If anything, I've started to present myself more androgynous with more typically masculine characteristics. dont get me wrong, I love dressing girly once in a while. but in general i like to present as a more gender ambiguous person.

I'm just concerned though, i mean, i dont mind the use of any pronouns. She/they/he is all good to me , IDC. And I dont really experience dysphoria, (other than a slight discomfort with my breasts which I'm planning to get a reduction so that I can look more gender neutral)

I've often debated, am I considered part of the genderqueer spectrum? Or am I just, an androgynous girl who likes to dress boyish? I dont want to claim I am genderqueer if I'm not, especially if I'm fine with my biological sex. Any advice on this?

I also posted this in r/questioning.

so i’m pretty sure i’m a girl. at least i have been pretty sure for most of my life. (i’m still a teenager btw.)  but lately i’ve just kind of been questioning it? sometimes I love makeup, and it makes me feel good, but other times it feels wrong, in a way. I have three items of traditionally male clothing in my closet, and about a week ago I tried them on and said to myself “god, why would I ever wear this?” but then the other day I wore the exact same outfit and felt very correct?? idk how to phrase it.

I know it goes deeper than just style, but I have no idea how to say it. I guess I just don’t feel like a girl all the time... idk if that makes any sense. gender dysphoria sounds way too dramatic for what i’m feeling, but at the same time I just know this probably isn’t normal. I have friends who I am close with that are trans, and dysphoria sounds awful. I really don’t think I have it, but then what am I feeling?

sorry if this kind of turned into a rant. i’m just kind of struggling with myself. i’ve never really liked labels in general, like with my sexuality even though i’ve embraced the terms bisexual or pansexual, I don’t feel very personally connected to them.

straight and gay were something that always confused me too. like, I know what they mean and all that, I just could never personally connect them to myself, even though I can picture myself with a man or a woman. is that a “symptom” that I might not be as cis as I though?

ugh. I guess with gender I always thought it would be black and white, but now that i’m struggling with this, I have no idea how to see myself. i’m fine with pronouns being she/her, but I guess I wouldn’t hate being called by male terms, or even just “they.”

But now, instead of feeling like people are properly treating me as a feminine nonbinary person, and as a transgender person, I feel like my journey and my uniqueness is being erased and now I'm just a basic bitch or something.

for a long time i was like the time for coming out is not came yet because i was still questioning myself and i felt coming out would be awkward and cringe. well i still feel that it would be awkward but now i'm pretty hella sure i'm genderqueer. actually why i'm writing this post is to ask you guys what changed in your life after your coming out?

i mean my friends, family don't really care about whether male or female clothes i'm wearing or whether i have blue or red long hair until it's stylish. i can easily act and dress and be in my way without weird questions or without getting asked about my style or my anything.

BUT random people on the street/shop/party/whatever are always asking me ""are you a girl or what?""

Today I decided I was taking a month off of work to figure out exactly what my problems are after having suicidal feelings this morning. Depression has been with me (at least emotionally if not clinically) since my teens. I've got cognitive behavioral therapy lined up to deal with it, maybe. Although there are other factors involved, it's only recently that I made the connection that my feelings may have to do with how I feel about my body.

I've been talking with a transgender friend about this. After I described how I was feeling, she thinks that how I'm feeling is likely not dysphoria, but possibly body dysmorphia. I find some of my male characteristic physical traits to be upsetting. The most prominent one is my hair. I'm showing signs of male pattern baldness and in my late teens I was obsessed with it, but I repressed those feelings. I thought I was just being vain, so I felt really guilty about it. If possible, I would like to present as anything other than a man physically, and I think this is the main thing stopping me.

To that end I'm strongly considering trying to get started on finasteride. I've read about the side effects and honestly I'd still be willing to take it for upwards of a few years at least, or even indefinitely. I don't feel the need to *live* as a woman if that requires HRT, but I'd like to grow long hair and maybe dress in cute stuff. As a teen I was sometimes confused for a girl when I had long hair (although that can be common even among CIS folk of course). I kind of hated it when people started referring to me definitively as a man. I think if I took finasteride treatment, I'd be able to strike a good middle ground between being able to comfortably present androgenously and not necessarily having to commit to it forever. My only concern is that since I possibly suffer from depression, I've heard it can make things worse.

What do you think? I need to get a sick note from my doctor for work tomorrow re: depression, but I'm thinking of also telling them about identifying as non-binary and my desire for this treatment. Do you think it could help, along with potentially seeking help with dysmorphia symptoms? I worry that this behavior may be self destructive.

24,2019-02-05 01:02:55,an8oop,0,1,"Hi there! I have just been sitting here looking at my hands... and thinking and wondering about something I’ve felt for a long time. It’s always been confusing seeing trans people, lesbians, etc and feeling like there really hasn’t been something clear I’ve been able to identify with. I’m not a woman who feels like a man exactly and I’m not a true lesbian. I like both men and women, but feel like I also go between feeling like this weirdly masculine person in a petite body and with an ultra feminine natural appearance. 

So... I guess I’m trying to figure it out? I feel like socially I’m a guy most of the time, I can’t like geek out with girls and I’m always super awkward around a table of women. I usually then gravitate toward the men who tend to not always get me or get why I’m trying to talk to them. I feel more like I belong with guys, socially... but then I don’t feel accepted by them. I’m just trying to figure it out because I’m generally fine with being a woman, I just feel like I’m a certain kind that isn’t like... the average one? Something about how I connect to people, I’m fairly distant and vague and stoic, like men can often be with one another. I either shut off emotionally or I’m very emotional. Much honestly, again like I think men can be too. 

Then there are just things I’m not super feminine about and never have been. But I feel like people want me to be. I always get compliments when I wear a dress... and... yeah it kind of sucks honestly. Anyway, idk just putting some thoughts out there because I’m feeling kind of lost and down. It’s like I never belong with anyone. Gender fluid seems like it makes sense.. sometimes I go between two genders when I masturbate, it’s weird. Like I can embody both genders at different times... and both makes sense to me. Anyway, it would be awesome to know about more people like me because I’ve never met anyone my particular breed of... whatever I am. :)

30,2019-02-06 18:20:58,antoq0,12,1,"As per my last post on this sub Reddit I and my gender psychiatrist appointment today, this is a post about it, warning it is long, there is a tldr down the bottom.

So at the appointment, the doctor is an old guy, going over basic stuff, general/family history, friends and so on. After that we went onto the crux's of the matter, my gender dysphoria I get sometimes with being genderfluid. He gets confused about the term so I explain it to him, at which point he proclaims that there is nothing that he or anyone else could do but ""wait for my mind to make up its mind which gender (male or female was implied at this point) it wanted to be"". This is about 25-30 minutes into the appointment. 

At this point I realise that it's going to be a fight and launch straight into ""there is more than two genders"" teaching mode, with examples in genetics, nature and even in some  societies. During this time he does the ""I'm listening but I'm not and my mind is already made up look"" but I do the whole speel. At the end of it he says that there is nothing anyone can do till my mind is made up on a gender and I decide if I want to transition fully or not.

So at this point I grab my stuff, say a hurried bye and leave, being supremely pissed off that I wasn't listened to and that he didn't even try to understand what I was telling him. So this eventually becomes the minor panic attack I thought it would become after the initial rage weared off, by then I had made the short walk home and thankful my lovely partner was there to help me calm down before it spiraled any worse.

After calming down I go back and request an appointment with a different psychiatrist, asking for someone who had experience or training with non binary (NB) people. The receptionist had no idea about NB stuff so passed it onto the duty officer, had a short chat with them, they didn't know much either but they said they would get me the appointment with the other psychiatrist there once they had talked to the medical secretary.

While walking me back out we bumped into the medical secretary, they go off and have a quick talk while I wait for a couple of minutes. I was surprised when I was asked if I was okay to have another chat with the two of them this time.

Once back in the private room the medical secretary asked me what I would like to be called, the first medical professional in the entire time I was there to ask me. She was kind and actually talked to be about how this all worked, that the psychiatrist does the initial knowledge gathering which is then passed onto the gatekeeper (no joke, was the word they used) and that they are the ones to make the decision and that it was policy that the info gets passed on no matter what the psychiatrist thinks. She also then informed me that the psychiatrist was new to the centre, had little or no training about gender stuff and I was his second gender related case there.

I thanked her for giving me more information and reassurence in 10 minutes than the psychiatrist had in an hour. She saved what would have been a super shitty day otherwise. 

Once I got home I got a call a few minutes later from her letting me know that my case had been sent through to the gatekeeper and wished me the best of luck. 

So I just have to wait 4 years now, which is short compared to some places in the UK, to see if something come from this.

Tldr: had my ""gender"" psychiatrist appointment today, psychiatrist was an ass who either didn't want to listen and or care and the day was saved by my wonderful partner and a very knowledgeable medical secretary who deserves an award or something.

I'm not sure if this is the right forum for this or not, and if it's not then please feel free to remove this. 

I think I'm finally realizing that I'm genderfluid. I'm AMAB, married to a wonderful woman (cis,bi), but all my life I've felt more feminine than masculine. I've never felt the traditional machoness that society says we need to feel but I've struggled in being comfortable with my own masculinity. I've always been closer to girls, and had more girl friends than guys as a kid growing up. 

I've crossdressed, and crossdreamt so many times I can't keep count. I've dreamt over and over of buying that pretty dress on h&amp;m or those cute panties on aerie but never did. I've watched makeup tutorials and browsed make up but never went ahead with it. Mainly because I was confused. I didn't think I was Trans. I didn't think I was female enough on the inside. I didn't think I wanted to be on hormones or even give up my masc side. I guess a part of me liked doing things as a man, wearing boxers, having a beard. 

I grew up in India, in what would be a good conservative society that didn't even decriminalize homosexuality until very recently. Maybe my conservative upbringing was clashing with my femme side? 

And even now, a part of me thinks about me in a dress or a skirt or lingerie and I think to myself ""I'm a dude. It's so silly"" but I guess I've finally realised it thanks to you wonderful people. Your posts and pictures have inspired me to come out to myself as genderfluid. I don't have to be 100% masc nor do I have to be 100% femme. I just need to be myself or myselves. I have a femme side and a masc side. And all those times I said no to the dress or the makeup was my masc side. 

I think I'm beginning to understand the two sides of me, and I'm slowly going to explore this, read up on it and understand more about myself before I can come out to my wife. I don't know that I'll come out to the public ever, but I can't keep these sides of me hidden from my wife for long. I'm so thankful to you guys for helping me realise who I am, and if all goes well I will be leaning on you for support before I tell my wife. 

I'm in tears as I sign this post with both my names for the very first time. 

Love,

I\'ve never felt the traditional machoness that society says we need to feel but I\'ve struggled in being comfortable with my own masculinity. I\'ve always been closer to girls, and had more girl friends than guys as a kid growing up. \n\nI\'ve crossdressed, and crossdreamt so many times I can\'t keep count. I\'ve dreamt over and over of buying that pretty dress on h&amp;m or those cute panties on aerie but never did. I\'ve watched makeup tutorials and browsed make up but never went ahead with it. Mainly because I was confused. I didn\'t think I was Trans. I didn\'t think I was female enough on the inside. I didn\'t think I wanted to be on hormones or even give up my masc side. I guess a part of me liked doing things as a man, wearing boxers, having a beard. \n\nI grew up in India, in what would be a good conservative society that didn\'t even decriminalize homosexuality until very recently. Maybe my conservative upbringing was clashing with my femme side? \n\nAnd even now, a part of me thinks about me in a dress or a skirt or lingerie and I think to myself ""I\'m a dude. It\'s so silly"" but I guess I\'ve finally realised it thanks to you wonderful people. Your posts and pictures have inspired me to come out to myself as genderfluid. I don\'t have to be 100% masc nor do I have to be 100% femme. I just need to be myself or myselves. I have a femme side and a masc side. And all those times I said no to the dress or the makeup was my masc side. \n\nI think I\'m beginning to understand the two sides of me, and I\'m slowly going to explore this, read up on it and understand more about myself before I can come out to my wife. I don\'t know that I\'ll come out to the public ever, but I can\'t keep these sides of me hidden from my wife for long. I\'m so thankful to you guys for helping me realise who I am, and if all goes well I will be leaning on you for support before I tell my wife. \n\nI\'m in tears as I sign this post with both my names for the very first time. \n\nLove, \nSandhya and Sandeep.

Maybe this is because being a guy seems easier from my perspective, or maybe I really am genderfluid. But in the meantime, I'm identifying with genderfluid just because I want to try it out.

Little bit of history here first - I'm AFAB but presented as male from 13-19.

I then lived as female, dated and then married my straight, cis-male best friend. I'm now 24 and really, reaaallly not coping.

I know, pretty stupid way to live. Anyway, I've rather abruptly reached the I Can't Anymore stage and have an overwhelming need to just be myself, fuck what that might mean for the world around me.

I don't think I'm trans, but I do have massive amounts of disphoria around my body most of the time. I think I'm probably gender fluid but honestly, I don't really know. 

My main problem is my husband. I love him to pieces, and if I decided to transition fully I know he'd try and find a way to be ok with it, but he loves my body the way I am and I don't want to destroy our relationship. 

Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? How did your partners deal with issues of disphoria? Honestly, I would love any advice about any of this because I'm confused and terrified and I don't know how to deal with anything right now.

Even now, I love dressing up in robes and kilts and skirted attire far more than in pants. I own a caftan that I only ever dare wear around the house. Being told unironically that I'm ""pretty"" thrills me way more than being told I'm ""handsome"", which feels like it doesn't fit.
