I came out as a transmasculine nonbinary person to my parents a week ago, and although they're continuing to misgender and misname me in an effort to get used to my new name and pronouns, they've been altogether supportive and willing to learn. So much so, in fact, that they asked me to put together a list of queer terms to help them better understand what NB and trans and altogether queer identities are.

So, I've started a term list and am asking you all to contribute to it (with both terms and definitions and term ordering): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNGytYgg9n8MArpYQBVbZ3ffmFp9V5Lqvc_wBenTkFo/edit?usp=sharing

I know I can just consult then copy and paste from preexisting articles that have comprehensively compiled and defined terms in the way that I'm trying to, but I figure this could be a positive opportunity for our own clarifications and even discussions of these terms. This is still a learning process even for me, so the terms that I've listed as of right now are basically the extent of what I know. Please add other terms, and please feel free to contribute to defining all listed terms (I'm gonna thoroughly go through the doc in a couple days, or maybe even a week or two, to better organize the contributions).

I really wish to look androgynous and try longer hair but it feels since I am AFAB it's so hard. I'm planning to dye it in the near future (probably pastel pink, pastel blue or pastel purple) since I've let it rest for over 1 year after shaving it all off.

So I wonder.. are there any good longer hairstyles that can help me look more androgynous? Or is short hair a must?

I'd love to chat with anyone who has had a reduction, especially if you're nonbinary-identified and tried to go for something ""in between."" I use they/them pronouns. I rarely post things like this so I sorta rambled a lot. It might also be relevant that I'm fat - 225 lbs and 5'7"".

I had a reduction on Dec 5, aiming for an A or B cup (I specified I wanted something kinda in between shape-wise, and I wanted to be able to go without a bra). My initial size was a 36I based on a ribcage measurement of 36 and a chest measurement of 44. When I came out of surgery, the surgeon and her assistant said it went very well but they hoped my chest was small enough - eek. My current size (4 weeks out) is around a 36D (chest measurement 40). I assume some of that is swelling.

I'm thinking I might need to have a revision, but since it has only been a month I know my current measurements might not be accurate. I'm kinda dysphoric right now because I have my period (not on hormones, but I've been considering a low dose). It gets to the point where I'm wondering if I should have just gone for DI... but there's definitely a ""not trans enough"" anxiety element too. My body is super curvy so it feels impossible not to be misgendered female 100% of the time. Also, I had a raging period the morning of my surgery and was losing it a little because I couldn't take ibuprofen. I feel like I missed an opportunity to nail things down because I was so anxious and preoccupied.

Overall though, I like the shape that my surgeon created - it's unique and feels like me. I just wanted it to be like...half the size that it currently is. Maybe my chest will get smaller by the time I have my 3 month appt, but I've been fatigue-eating and I'm worried I'm just going to put a bunch of weight back on my chest.

The other thing is that I thought some fat/tissue would be removed from under my arms, but it wasn't, really. I think I had a fundamental misunderstanding of what normally happens during a breast reduction and should have asked more questions. This is a classic issue with me and any sort of medical interactions or body modifications. I tend to screw it up the first time out of anxiety and then I have to go back for some kind of do-over.

53,2019-01-03 04:58:51,ac26rz,7,1,"Hello all! New to reddit and first post here. Seems like a great community. Appreciate everyone who reads and TL;DR is at the bottom.

This is maybe more a social awkwardness question than a Queer question, and hopefully most of y'all don't have this problem.

I'm AFAB they/them, genderqueer androgynous. I'm not trans and as of now am not changing my body, just my presentation. I'm presenting andro style and demeanor but have a noticeably feminine face and form, so I'm mainly read as a femmey tomboiish lesbian. The average person in my area is getting relatively woke about binary transpeople but not less straightforward identities.

So problem 1: 

I'm generally an introvert in the way that makes me seem standoffish. It's perfectly reasonable for someone to read me as a female lesbian and I'm not innately offended by that, but I also don't like talking about myself and feel self centered about stopping people to focus on a ""me"" thing. So most of the time when I try to casually say ""Actually, I'm not a girl, I'm a 'they', thanks"", my discomfort comes through and I see people pull back as though I'm about to go all raging SJW caricature. Usually, if they're cool, they correct themselves and keep going but a new wall is up in the interaction and it sucks. I come off like I'm ""correcting"" when really I just want to be adjusting I guess.

I know I need to work on my body language and probably tone, but I think picking gentle and friendly go-to wording will help. I always say ""thanks"" and I believe my issues are making it seem sarcastic when it's not. But I mean, I don't want to take out ""thanks""!! And I usually start with ""actually"", I realize that should go lol.

What do y'all say?

Problem 2:

Like I said, people in my area don't know a ton about nonbinarism so what also happens often when I say ""actually, I'm not a girl, I'm a 'they', thanks"" is they don't really process it and assume I'm a transman who's not passing yet. Again, this is often not prejudice and perfectly reasonable to them. But if they refer to me as a male soon after, I want to stop letting that go, but not start derailing entire conversations explaining it, especially if my first correction didn't go down so smooth. 

Does anyone have a concise go-to wording that lets the person make the adjustment and the conversation keep flowing to make this second correction? 

TLDR How do you let people know about misgendering without coming on too strong, and how do you consicely clarify a lesser known nonbinary identity without making the whole conversation about you explaining it?

Thanks everyone!

I have been larger my entire life. So a lot of gender dysphoria I was feeling I just shrugged off as hatred for my fat body since everyone else seemed to hate it as well. Over the last couple years with the increase of the body positive movement for woman of all sizes I was just starting to become comfortable as a fat woman. And then it really hit me that I wasn't a woman at all. And haven't been for a while. I had dabbled in labels, genderfluid, bigender, demigirl,(notice all of these labels are still connected to some part of my femininity, like I didn't want to let go of that part of me. Partly because I was semi ok being a large woman), pronouns and names etc I didn't feel valid because of my size so I just gave up.


Late November I had this realization that I really truly was not a cis woman or any kind of woman at all. I started going by Avery online (a seperate twitter and Instagram) and using they/them and it just felt so right. My partner has been incredibly supportive of these changes because he's always known me to be not feminine anyways and it was always awkward when I did try with makeup and done up hair and dresses and other stereotypical girl things. 

Then on December 9th we almost died in a head on collision on the highway. I was wearing a binder when we were run into by the oncoming car and sustained extremely bad injuries to my chest. Upon crawling out of the car I couldn't breath and was screaming for my partner about my binder. Bystanders had no idea what I was talking about. Paramedics had to cut it off of me. It was left discarded at the scene. Some kind soul off of a NB Facebook group offered to send me his used binder in the same size when I posted about it and asking for some support. I was overjoyed and allowed myself to accept his offer. I even paid him back for shipping. It's here... but I can't wear it until I am fully healed.


I've been spending each day at my mom's house while my partner has been able to return to work. With my injuries and mental state I just can't be left alone all day. And I'm not out to her so I just get called ""my girl"" and ""birthname"" all day and I get to hear ""she and her"" in reference to me when she talks about my accident. The paper reported me as a woman. The Facebook posts were all awful. And I had no right to speak up about it because I'm not out yet.


So I've decided that 2019 will be the year of Avery and I plan on coming out at some point. I want to be my true self since my true self almost died a secret a month ago.


But I'm having trouble accepting my size as a NB person. I don't think I'll ever have that straight cut androgynous look that I see others with. Does anyone know of any larger NB people with Instagrams I can follow? I just want to see myself in others. I want to see something i relate to.

58,2019-01-03 17:00:15,ac7m3w,4,1,"I've been thinking of the gap between how others perceive us and our self knowledge. Thanks to this community, I hear from so many people who are struggling with that gap, whether it's due to unsafe environments, experimentation, or lack of resources. Ultimately, I'm wondering whether people choose to express their gender for maximum legibility/passing likelihood, or decide to be comfortable knowing they aren't passing. 

A couple of specific examples:

HAIR: When I had super short hair, I frequently got called Sir or the ""sir-ma'am-sir"" scramble. It felt pretty good. Kids would ask what I am. I confused people. However, I liked having my hair a certain way, which meant I'd trim at least the sideburns and back every week. I'd put gel or goop in it everyday. I could only wear certain hats, etc. Standing in front of a mirror to primp makes me feel more femme, though. I carried around that, ""How do I look?"" voice that I associate with being a woman. 

Now that I'm growing my hair out, absolutely nobody is confused. I sadly pass as a woman. But my hair rarely needs a trim. I don't wash or style it. I roll out of bed like, Okay. Where's the coffee? I can wear a bike helmet or beanie or fedora. No products. My experience of myself feels so laid back, which is something I associate with men. A lackadaisical attention to grooming. 

BINDING: As a genderfluid non-binary person, I definitely have days I wanna look like Stephen Sondheim in the early seventies. I bought a binder. It fits. It works. It looks good with turtlenecks and sweaters. But I know I'm wearing it. It feels like wearing a corset. 

I've been lucky enough to not really need to wear a bra, so even before I was non-binary, I felt like bras or slips were for ultra femme dress up and costuming. I actually like the feeling of being constricted and delicate. But it isn't very gay man as an internal experience. I don't feel like I actually have a flat chest. I just feel like I'm using a product to look good. 

So far, I fall on the side of internal perception. I'm growing my hair out. My binder is lost somewhere in my partner's closet. I have to be in my body all the time, whereas I'm only sometimes being misgendered by others. However, I live with this nagging sense that ""If only I tried harder, people would be less essentialist.""

82,2019-01-04 18:50:51,acl8pv,10,1,"28, AMAB, Agender, and Gay here.

Background: this story revolves around a Grindr/Scruff meetup I had. These are iPhone apps which, for those not in the know, are geolocation primarily intended to facilitate sexual liaisons between queer men. In a Grindr bio, you have a choice to specify gender and pronouns, and of course I indicated that I’m agender and use “they” pronouns. The Scruff bio however doesn’t give you this option. That will be an important distinction later in the story.

Hopefully I’m not insulting anyone’s intelligence with the above paragraph, but with that out of the way, here’s my story:

I just recently relocated to Chicago. In addition to finding a job, I had been hoping to make some friends, go on a few dates, and satisfy a few of my more base desires on Grindr/Scruff. 

Eventually I met these two guys on Scruff (where my gender was likely assumed to be “male”) who wanted a threesome. I try to assume the best in others, but these were extremely jocky, white, business-type guys who probably haven’t had to put much thought into an identity or perspective beyond being gay. Not unlike the sort I have learned to be careful around when discussing my gender, or social justice at all.

Regardless, I went to their apartment because I have a libido and it needed quelling. I’ll spare the gory details, but we did the deed and then started laying around snuggling in post coital bliss. It’s not out of custom to check one’s phone during this refractory period, and it was this time that they spotted me on Grindr and the biographical information attached to it.

So to my right, the first guy asks me “You’re agender?” I barely had time to dread the incoming conversation when he immediately said “That’s cool. So you use gender-neutral pronouns. I’d feel bad if I got it wrong.”

“Yeah, I am. It’s this whole journey about how I feel in relation to gender roles. I’d hate to soapbox about it too much.”

Then the guy to my left chimes in “Please do, I’m interested in learning about it.”

So in just as much time as I spent messing with these guys, I also educated them on things like Judith Butler and performativity and how I feel uncomfortable being subject to a particular “role” or set of behaviors merely because of what my genitalia look like. Not once did they try to invalidate or alienate me. They were extremely respectful, asked plenty of questions, and seemed genuinely edified to have met (what I assume) is their first agender person.

The story, I feel, has two takeaways. One, in a sense, is that I ended up being more prejudiced than these two by assuming that I needed to be defensive, ironically, because of how I perceived their gender and personal presentation.

The other is that attitudes, I feel, are changing around gender. I’ve only been out for less than a year now, and I have encountered plenty of hostility and dismissiveness from those just learning about my gender identity. But this was refreshingly different, and gives me hope that the we, and especially the next generations, can be proud and less afraid of who we are.

In discussing this exchange, I hope to highlight the ways that things are improving for us, and that more and more people are accepting of the idea that gender is not an absolute based on biology, but relative to just about everyone.

85,2019-01-04 21:23:02,acmu5a,19,1,"I may delete this post later, but currently I don't know where else to reach out.

&amp;#x200B;

It is true that biological sex is not the same thing as gender, and that gender presentation does not always predict gender either (people of all genders fall in many different places across the femme-masc spectrum). So I am finding it difficult to understand how any of my features necessarily predict my current assigned gender identity. I am afab, I love makeup, I do enjoy feminine clothes, am not really into sports, etc. etc. But much like how enjoying makeup does not make a man any less of a man, how does it relate to me being a woman? If wearing a dress does not instantly transform someone into a woman, how does it necessarily gender me? Many people talk about this intuitive feeling of ""being a woman"" or ""being a man"" or another gender identity, but the more I think about it the more I fail to understand what this intuitive feeling is. So there are two possible conclusions that I can come to: a) gender is a completely made up concept and anyone who genders themselves is lying or b) I am different from most people in that I can't mentally grasp a gender identity, I guess making me agender. Conclusion a is probably not true, but I still cannot bring myself to accepting conclusion b. I guess these are the main reasons for that:

&amp;#x200B;

1) I do not want to appropriate the trans experience. I still feel pretty tied to the label of cis and don't want to poke my nose where I don't belong, I suppose. I also don't have any gender dysphoria and feel pretty comfortable with having a curvy body and breasts (I've had other body dysphoria related to weight, but never anything about sex). I know gender dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans, and I would never question another trans person for not having dysphoria, but I guess I just feel like I have not struggled enough to label myself as trans. As silly as it sounds, I don't want to be a ""wannabe nb"" (I'm so sorry I know that sounds ridiculous).

&amp;#x200B;

2) Maybe nobody *really* has a concrete concept of gender anyway, nothing more than a vague feeling, and I really am just overthinking it. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) I still, all in all, am feminine. I mostly wear feminine clothing, I do enjoy masculine clothing but I don't own a lot of it. I relate to the experiences of women (which could be because I've spent my whole life as a girl though). I am *fine* with female pronouns, but it's more of an indifference. So if I am *fine* with presenting and living as a woman, why should I care?

&amp;#x200B;

I know that I am a lot more critical of myself than I would be of anyone else. If a femme-looking person told me they were agender I obviously wouldn't squint at them and say ""are you reeeeaally agender?"" But I am not sure if what I am feeling is truly agender identity or just confusion.

So I am finding it difficult to understand how any of my features necessarily predict my current assigned gender identity. I am afab, I love makeup, I do enjoy feminine clothes, am not really into sports, etc. etc. But much like how enjoying makeup does not make a man any less of a man, how does it relate to me being a woman? If wearing a dress does not instantly transform someone into a woman, how does it necessarily gender me? Many people talk about this intuitive feeling of ""being a woman"" or ""being a man"" or another gender identity, but the more I think about it the more I fail to understand what this intuitive feeling is. So there are two possible conclusions that I can come to: a) gender is a completely made up concept and anyone who genders themselves is lying or b) I am different from most people in that I can\'t mentally grasp a gender identity, I guess making me agender. Conclusion a is probably not true, but I still cannot bring myself to accepting conclusion b. I guess these are the main reasons for that:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1) I do not want to appropriate the trans experience. I still feel pretty tied to the label of cis and don\'t want to poke my nose where I don\'t belong, I suppose. I also don\'t have any gender dysphoria and feel pretty comfortable with having a curvy body and breasts (I\'ve had other body dysphoria related to weight, but never anything about sex). I know gender dysphoria is not a requirement for being trans, and I would never question another trans person for not having dysphoria, but I guess I just feel like I have not struggled enough to label myself as trans. As silly as it sounds, I don\'t want to be a ""wannabe nb"" (I\'m so sorry I know that sounds ridiculous).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Maybe nobody *really* has a concrete concept of gender anyway, nothing more than a vague feeling, and I really am just overthinking it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) I still, all in all, am feminine. I mostly wear feminine clothing, I do enjoy masculine clothing but I don\'t own a lot of it. I relate to the experiences of women (which could be because I\'ve spent my whole life as a girl though). I am *fine* with female pronouns, but it\'s more of an indifference. So if I am *fine* with presenting and living as a woman, why should I care?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know that I am a lot more critical of myself than I would be of anyone else. If a femme-looking person told me they were agender I obviously wouldn\'t squint at them and say ""are you reeeeaally agender?"" But I am not sure if what I am feeling is truly agender identity or just confusion. I guess my big question is (something I\'ve tried researching but could not find a satisfying answer for) how do you know what your gender is?

We were thrilled. We would have been happy either way. At least that's what we tell ourselves.

At the second medical ultrasound, my wife went alone and asked again about the baby's sex. This time, the sonographer said that the child had both, male and female genitals.

We were upset. My thoughts went wild. I opened the bible to look for answers and found these passages:

&gt; So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. Genesis 1:27 (KJV)

&gt; Thou shalt not kill. Exodus 20:13 (KJV)

Yes, I was thinking about abortion. I didn't know I had it in me. But according to the bible, my child wasn't human.

After I got past my emotions, I started reading about intersexuality. I found out that some infants with ambiguous genitalia undergo surgical interventions to make them look more masculine or feminine. Surgery is done at an age when doctors can best decide what's best for the child: Boy or girl.

I also learned that some people who have surgeries suffer from it as adults. They might end up feeling differently about their sexuality than the well-meaning doctors and parents. This information didn't help me at all. In fact, it scared me even more. But no matter what, we were going to go through it. I was already planning on having the talk with my baby and explaining to it the differences between man and woman and hetero- and homosexual.

Today I know there is at least one more option, which is simply intersexuality. I can't imagine, what challenges intersex people have to face. Stories about suicides, suicide attempts or self-mutilation are frightening. 

As it happens, I won't be dealing with the challenges and joys of an intersex child in the near future. We ended up getting a boy. But it's a shame that I only heard about intersexuality when I was facing the issue myself. Many intersex babies are aborted, killed or mutilated and we never hear from them.

I will never forget what the sonographer at our third diagnostic sonography said:

I’m AMAB but I’m not sure how comfortable I feel with that. I put questioning my gender on the back burner until I could figure out my sexuality, aroace btw. 

I started worrying about gender because I had a dream where I was a trans woman. I remember worrying a lot about if I passed. I’ve had dreams where I was male, female, or sometimes a thing without gender, but it didn’t bother me until now. I had another dream where I was a young girl and it felt so real. I know dreams might not mean anything but they were just so intense.

I’ve been looking at trans subreddits a fair bit lately and sometimes I feel a weird jealousy. It’s not always though. It’s just some of the time. Sometimes I’ll see a person who looks more androgynous and I’d feel really attracted, at least that what I thought it was at the time, but now I think it might have been jealousy. I remember yesterday I started feeling what I guess might be dysphoria. I would look in the mirror or at my arms and wish I was more androgynous, but I’m very obvious male in appearance.

I started trying out different pronouns in my head and I felt uncomfortable with all of them. If it’s not too NSFW when I’m in the shower sometimes I wish I just didn’t have sexual organs. They make me feel weird, and it’s not like I want to use them ever. I wonder if my questioning is just due to me being ace.  

I also recently started noticing how at work I act a lot more “feminine”. My voice becomes more high and breathy. And my movements are a lot more flowy. I felt really good acting like that. My voice already sounds somewhere between the stereotypical gay voice and a grocery story announcement saying “clean up on land 8”. So it isn’t too hard to sound more feminine.

The thing is that I don’t always feel like this. Sometimes I feel very neutral and other times I feel a bit more feminine. Sometimes I wish I looked more feminine or androgynous, and others I feel ok. I think it could have something to do with my disassociation and depersonalization. I always feel a disconnect between my body and myself. I don’t feel like my reflection or hands belong to me. When I think if I feel like a man or a woman I usually just end up thinking that I hardly feel like I have a body to begin with.

115,2019-01-06 00:31:48,ad090g,9,1,"I’ve been questioning my gender for a while and am a little conflicted. I feel that I have the mental discomforts of gender dysphoria without any of the physical ones.

Logically, I feel that I’m NB. I’m AFAB but extremely uncomfortable with hyper femininity. I would never paint my nails, wear makeup, get my eyebrows done, etc. I think I had some gender dysphoria throughout my life because I always had a non feminine side that I wished I could show. Logically speaking, I think I’m non binary. I feel like it would explain a lot about my discomfort with femininity.

However, I’m totally okay with my body. I don’t have the desire to wear a binder or get any surgeries. I experimented with they/them pronouns last year and it just felt unnecessary. I think I would be happy if people called me they/them but it also doesn’t bother me to be called she/her. When I was like 15 I thought I was a trans man for a few weeks and while I was definitely wrong I still feel like that’s a red flag.

I’m okay with being in this body, but my own personal interpretation of gender doesn’t quite line up with the sex I was born as. I get dysphoric when I look too feminine but it’s mostly just that my hair is too long or I don’t like how my clothes make me look like a girl. I’m fine with being physically built like a woman but it’s the social connotations of being a woman (in mannerisms, style, etc) that I reject and fail to identify with. Does anyone have a similar experience? I feel kind of invalid and I question whether I’m actually NB because people here are posting about top surgeries, binders, and pronoun issues but I don’t really have those things.

I grew up in a conservative Christian household in Midwest America. When I was 4 years old I can remember praying that God would make me a girl,

I loved to play dress up and especially loved dressing in my sisters clothes. There was just something about looking pretty that made me feel beautiful inside and I loved that girls seemed to be able to play dress up everyday. 

I never told my family I wanted to be a girl because I knew they didn’t approve of it based on the  somewhat homophobic off handed jokes and comments they would make to one another. I loved feeling pretty and being admired but I didn’t want to be laughed at. But I kept praying that God would make me a girl and I would occasionally sneak clothes  from the laundry basket before they made it to my sister’s room. 

Fast forward through a very repressed teenager years in which I would sneak make-overs with my sisters makeup before I would take a shower so I could get a glimpse of how I felt on the inside. I went to a private Christian college and convinced myself that I was not Transgendered or Gay because I was attracted to women (and men) and because I liked who I was and how my life was going. It was also important to me to find a partner that would get along well with my family. I met my wife at college and we dated for 2 years before I came out to her that I thought I was transgendered when I was younger and part of me felt that it was still a part of me but I loved her and wanted to be with her. We cried and she asked a lot of questions. We both researched and prayed and laughed and cried a lot. She told me she supported me and would love to help me. She even offered to buy makeup and clothes at the store since I was too shy to shop for it myself. Turned out her encouragement was all I needed to flourish. 

 We continued to fall in love and decided to get married. I worked up the courage to start asking her to buy things like makeup and clothes that I could wear around the house. We love our relationship but none of our friends or family know about me being non-binary/queer so we don’t go out that often and if we entertain I get nervous to dress and act the way I am. 

At least I used to. 

This year I am committed to be more of myself and my wife and I have seen such a difference in our relationship since I’ve accepted who I am and have started to embrace it in our lives. I want to share this part of who I am with my family and close friends this year but don’t know how. Like is it even necessary to say?

171,2019-01-07 16:04:45,adj2e1,7,1,"Hi! Throwaway because I’m A Coward.

I’m sorry this is probably pretty unreadable, i’m really bad at getting my thoughts out but wanted to try anyway.

so sometimes i like to play a game in my head called “do i actually deserve to do what i want with my body or am i just being an ungrateful, spoiled teen”. It’s not a very fun game and always ends with me either crying or so frustrated with myself as to consider self-harm (consider, not actually do. Like i said: A Coward).

I don’t know what i am and any attempt to put a label on myself just leaves me feeling dissatisfied and/or fake. I’m not sure if this is because i just don’t care for labels or because i feel like i don’t fit the descriptions of what’s typically assumed of those labels (i’m not white, my hair is a thick fro, etc.) or some other third thing.

I know what i want to do, though: to have my hair short and wear more neutral clothing.

I think it’s worth it to add that my parents are Christians. I don’t really know where they stand on the LGBT+ community, but i’ve been leaning toward “not very fond of”. My dad *has* made trans and gay jokes in the past and has joked about not wanting people to see me as a boy. I tried to ask my mom if i could wear “less feminine” clothing but she got upset, thinking i wanted to dress like a boy.

I’ve also asked them both about getting a haircut.

Now I don’t mind not having the specific clothes i want, i’m fine with the ones i have for the most part, but hair is a completely different story.

It took a lot of asking, but they eventually said yes after showing them that twa hairstyles were a thing. However, that was a few months ago and i haven’t gotten a haircut yet.

And this shouldn’t be as frustrating as it is, but i can’t stand it? Just… the thought that my hair is still the way it is makes me feel horrible. Whenever i’m feeling particularly stressed out i get the urge to just grab some scissors and cut it all off myself. I’ve been tempted to try to explain to them why this feels so important to me, but i’m horrible with words and i know it’ll only end with me crying and looking like a spoiled brat.

I’ve brought up getting it cut recently, but the answer’s always been “wait”. I assume it’s because we don’t have the money, but my dad’s said he’d be able to do it. My mom, however, really doesn’t want the cut to come out bad which, my hair is already in a state of chaos right now (since neither she nor I feel like putting in the effort to really maintain it), it can’t be much worse. I think she just doesn’t want to lose all my hair, seeing as she's made many comments on how “thick and beautiful” it is.

I’ve thought about getting it cut once I’ve gone out of state for college, but I don’t know when that’ll be and I don’t think I can wait that long.

I hate that i’m so fixated on this, i hate that i want things so much. I seriously wish i could just… Be happy with how i am right now? That i could stop worrying so much over gender identity and just live my life. And yet i feel like i can’t really be happy with myself until i get the freedom to explore these things. I dunno. I just feel stuck.

Tl;dr, probably more comprehensible than the above tbh: i really, really want to cut my hair and dress differently (but mostly cut my hair) in an attempt to figure myself out and feel i’m getting unreasonably upset at my parents not letting me.

I’m an undergrad doing her thesis (@ the University of Western Ontario) on the relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation for transgender and non-binary people. My survey includes a few items to measure both gender identity and sexual orientation and a few questions about factors that may have influenced one’s understanding of their own gender identity and sexual orientation. In addition there’s a few questions asking what you think are appropriate ways of asking about these topics. As I really wanted to get trans/NB voices in the literature in terms of what are appropriate ways of asking certain research questions around these topics.

It is anonymous and open to transgender and non-binary people who are over 16 years old.

I find myself stressing and feeling sad about things that did not stress me before. I didn’t realize that I’m probably non binary until this week and it’s really hard on my mental health. 

I can’t look at my reflection anymore without feeling upset by how masculine I look. Before I never really payed much mind to my appearance, I hardly felt any connection to my reflection due to disassociation and depersonalization, so I never felt too dysphoric, if that’s the right word.

My arms and legs are hairy as hell, I’m 6 foot, and my facial structure is masculine as well. 

(Honestly this next paragraph is kinda unnecessary to get my point across, but I’m leaving it in anyway because I already wrote it)

I had the thought that I might not be cis for months, but I pushed deep into the back of my mind. I only felt weird miss labeled stress about my masculine traits (I don’t know what else to call it). I’ve been paying more attention to my voice, even before thinking I was enby. I remember making jokes for a day with my guy friends trying to see who could do the best girl voice. I didn’t realize it then, but looking back it was probably just a way to explore being more feminine in an ironic way. I also noticed that I would spend a long time on r/androgynous looking a pictures of androgynous people. I always justified it as “I just find them attractive” which is ironic because I also was realizing at the time that I was ace. I also had a few dreams where I was female and those made me feel very uncomfortable after waking up.

I’ve felt some level of “dysphoria” before, but it was never this strong. It was always just a little thing in the back of my mind that would only surface in ways that I didn’t even label as possibly being dysphoria until now. Now it can be crippling.

I've been on a pretty wild gender questioning ride this last month (one that's felt long overdue), and I've been primarily exploring the femme world (I'm AMAB, for context), in terms of fashion &amp; presentation, but also in terms of.. energy? Mindset? Spirituality? I'm having a hard time putting it to words -- it's been a very internal process. For me, expressing feminine energy (interpret that as you will) feels natural &amp; nurturing &amp; healing &amp; peaceful in a lot of ways. Masculinity though.. I have a hard time separating the toxic elements (violence, intimidation, black &amp; white thinking, results-oriented mindset) from the rest. I can feel that there's masculine energy in me that wants to be expressed too, but I'm struggling with finding appropriate outlets. Hopefully this makes some modicum of sense, I'm really stretching on trying to express what is incredibly feelings-based to me. \^\_\_\_\^

For as long as I can remember I’m just generally unable to be present and experience life.\n\nThen I started thinking, how the hell did I make it to this point? How have I been enduring all the doubt and the pain and suffering? A word that I think is often used in situations like this, in a sort of inspirational way, is strength. But I don’t know if I agree with it, in my case anyway. I feel like I’ve just been hibernating all my life, giving up or avoiding many opportunities and being unable to truly enjoy the things I did do or experience. And I don’t think that necessarily shows strength. \n\nI hope this made sense.

While I'm still a long way to having Magnificent Beard**™,** there is actual HAIR on my FACE. I trimmed it down to stubble the other day, and I am really digging how it looks. I didn't realize I would like it as much as I do, or that it would have such an impact on how I feel about my gender presentation. \n\nAlso, I really like that having visible facial hair seems to help people not stumble over pronouns. I'm fairly ambivalent about which pronouns people use, but I am so uncomfortable when people try to correct themselves (without asking for my preference, of course) or just awkwardly avoid using pronouns at all.

This has been driving me absolutely crazy. I needed to put it somewhere people might read it.

 I am AFAB.  I am a relatively femme person- long hair, I wear makeup, etc. However, I have never felt like I was 100% a woman. I do not feel masc much at all, it is like I am between ""a girl and femme (occasionally butchy, im fluid between them) TV static."". Something i cant give a name to. I have always had this weird dissociation from my assigned gender, even if i do not horribly mind my old pronouns, and adore presenting high femme at times.

I finally realized I may be Nonbinary. They/them feels oddly right used alongside she/her in online spaces. I have tried to find resources on places like Youtube. Unfortunately almost all of the AFAB NB creators on there that I have found are transmasc or androgynous, which is pretty masc coded in many ways. It made me feel like I was fake for being an AFAB femme enby. Was I just a cis girl playing dressup? If someone called me sir, I would feel severe dissonance, but I wish people didnt all assume I was a ma'am. 

I dont mind my chest.
I get mildly dysphoric at monthly
I dont want to take T
I don't feel a need to bind, though i dress very butchy some days. Theres days where i wish i had a smaller chest, but i also already went through surgery in the past to reduce me from huge to large, and am somewhat fine with myself at this point.
I don't mind my old pronouns but prefer they/them

As an AFAB person, am I still real as a nonbinary?

373,2019-01-13 19:18:11,afmoyk,5,1," **Otto Eduard Leopold,**  known as **Otto von Bismarck,**  was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890 and was the first Chancellor Of the German Empire between 1871 and 1890. 

 

In 1862, King Wilhelm I appointed Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia, a position he would hold until 1890, with the exception of a short break in 1873. He provoked three short, decisive wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. Following the victory against Austria, he abolished the supranational German Confederation and instead formed the North German Confederation as the first German national state in 1867, leading it as Federal Chancellor. This aligned the smaller North German states behind Prussia. Later receiving the support of the independent South German states in the Confederation's defeat of France, he formed the German Empire in 1871, unifying Germany, with himself as Imperial Chancellor, while retaining control of Prussia at the same time. The new German nation excluded Austria, which had been Prussia's main opponent for predominance among the German states.

With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used the balance diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace. For historian Eric Hobsbawm it was Bismarck who ""remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, \[and\] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers"". However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanphobia in France. This helped set the stage for the First World War.

Bismarck's diplomacy of realpolitik and powerful rule at home gained him the nickname the ""Iron Chancellor"". German unification and its rapid economic growth was the foundation of his foreign policy. He disliked colonialism but reluctantly built an overseas empire when it was demanded by both elite and mass opinion. Juggling a very complex interlocking series of conferences, negotiations, and alliances, he used his diplomatic skills to maintain Germany's position and used the balance of power to keep Europe at peace in the 1870s and 1880s.

A master of complex politics at home, Bismarck created the first welfare state in the modern world, with the goal of gaining working class support that might otherwise go to his Socialist enemies. In the 1870s, he allied himself with the Liberals (who were low-tariff and anti-Catholic) and fought the Catholic Church in what was called the Kulturkampf (""culture struggle""). He lost that battle as the Catholics responded by forming a powerful Centre party and using universal male suffrage to gain a block of seats. Bismarck then reversed himself, ended the Kulturkampf, broke with the Liberals, imposed protective tariffs, and formed a political alliance with the Centre Party. to fight the Socialists. A devout Lutheran, he was loyal to his king, who argued with Bismarck but in the end, supported him against the advice of his wife and his heir. While the Reichstag, Germany's parliament, was elected by universal male suffrage, it did not have much control of government policy. Bismarck distrusted democracy and ruled through a strong, well-trained bureaucracy with power in the hands of a traditional Junker elite that consisted of the landed nobility in eastern Prussia. Under Wilhelm I, Bismarck largely controlled domestic and foreign affairs, until he was removed by the young Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1890, at the age of seventy-five.

Bismarck – a Junker himself – was strong-willed, outspoken and overbearing, but he could also be polite, charming and witty. Occasionally he displayed a violent temper, and he kept his power by melodramatically threatening resignation time and again, which cowed Wilhelm I. He possessed not only a long-term national and international vision but also the short-term ability to juggle complex developments. As the leader of what historians call ""revolutionary conservatism"", Bismarck became a hero to German nationalist; they built many monuments honoring the founder of the new Reich. Many historians praise him as a visionary who was instrumental in uniting Germany and, once that had been accomplished, kept the peace in Europe through adroit diplomacy.

A 2011 biographer of Bismarck wrote that he was

a political genius of a very unusual kind \[whose success\] rested on several sets of conflicting characteristics among which brutal, disarming honesty mingled with the wiles and deceits of a confidence man. He played his parts with perfect self-confidence, yet mixed them with rage, anxiety, illness, hypochondria, and irrationality. ... He used democracy when it suited him, negotiated with revolutionaries and the dangerous Ferdinand Lassalle, the socialist who might have contested his authority. He utterly dominated his cabinet ministers with a sovereign contempt and blackened their reputations as soon as he no longer needed them. He outwitted the parliamentary parties, even the strongest of them, and betrayed all those ... who had put him into power. By 1870 even his closest friends ... realized that they had helped put a demonic figure into power.

I started questioning my identity a few years ago when I was in a day treatment program and they had an LGBTQ+ counselor there to talk to people about  sexual orientation/gender identity. As soon as she described nonbinary identity I felt like it applied to me, like I had a vocabulary to describe myself I didn't know about before. I talked about it a lot in therapy but my mental health worsened and I was sent to a residential center in 2016. I mentioned it there a few times but never really felt courageous enough to tell people. So basically I continued living life as a girl and kept using she/her pronouns and going by my birth name.

I used to call this person my boyfriend, and now they are trans enby... and I can see all of the signs all along, and it's beautiful to see them bloom into all of the expansiveness of who they really are, but I noticed that there's fear in me when I think about taking our relationship to a romantic place again.

I know that we both feel so much towards each other, and we've had quite an intimate relationship since getting back in touch, but I can't shake that I have this fear, and I think it's about ostracisation.

It's like, I don't have to live my life as an enby, I don't know what it's like to feel the way you have to, and this fear is the closest thing I have to touching on the empathy for what it must be like to present differently from the social norm.

I want to be there for this person, I want to fall back in love with them but I'm really scared and I'm not sure how to overcome that feeling... we've spoken really openly together about all of this, and we love each other a lot as people, and no matter what, we want to support each other. I want them to bloom in who they know they are, and I also don't want to be an obstacle to that, and so I'm wondering if I'm even the right partner if I feel this way.

426,2019-01-15 22:59:33,agehxe,19,1,"Apologies for this long confusing mess of ideas, but maybe some of you lovely folks can relate?

I’m AFAB and have been wrestling with my gender identity over the past few months. I seem to be cycling through this process of obsessing over my gender confusion and trying to find a label that feels right, become more confused and frustrated because nothing seems to exactly fit, decide to screw all the labels and just live my life, eventually become curious about or question my gender again, and repeat. It feels like I’m spinning my wheels and going nowhere. It’s exhausting. 

While I find that many non-binary people’s experiences (particularly agender/genderfluid), resonate with me, I don’t really experience dysphoria aside from mild social discomfort in certain situations – most often when I feel I am being treated or viewed differently because I’m perceived as a woman. 

Generally, I attribute this to disliking performing typical gender roles and patriarchy and all that fun stuff, but on the other hand I sometimes find myself admiring certain male physical characteristics and fantasizing about having a flatter chest or a more masculine build/physique. I’m also attracted to men/masculinity, so this can be confusing as the distinction between attraction and admiration can feel pretty murky. I actually have similar admiration vs attraction confusion towards women too, and have started exploring the idea that I may be bi. 

Aside from the above, what leads me to suspect that I could be non-binary are:

* feelings of being disconnected and apathetic towards gender or identifying with man/woman
* Love for androgyny and gender non-conformity. I dress somewhat androgynously as I don’t shave, wear makeup, have a short haircut, and prefer loose-fitting clothing that doesn’t emphasize my chest and hips.
* Tendency to forget that others see me as a woman and sometimes feeling genderless/gender neutral
* Feel best when I can express myself and dress without feeling like I’m trying to present as masculine or feminine

At the same time, I don’t think I fit non-binary/trans narratives as I don’t want to change my body (I don’t even have an interest in getting a binder, wearing a sports bra feels good for me), I don’t want to change my name, and I’m cool with any pronouns. I’m also not entirely disconnected from being a woman/female as I’ve lived my whole life as one, which has undoubtedly shaped my perspective and experiences. 

This leads to me believe that I’m most likely a cis woman that digs gender non-conformity and overthinks too much. I’m wary as well not to adopt marginalized identities that I don’t wholeheartedly feel that I belong to considering that I don’t share the same struggles with transition and dysphoria.

I suppose I’d feel alright describing myself as agender and/or non-binary, but not transgender. Although being transgender isn’t a requirement to identify as agender/non-binary, it appears that most people who do also consider themselves to be transgender. It seems that most people assume you are transgender if you identify as a non-binary person as well. I think that I’ll end up just confusing and upsetting people by claiming to be non-binary but not trans. 

I’m not even sure how much I care much about being seen as non-binary by others. I honestly wonder if my desire to identify as a non-binary or queer person is more about justifying a sense of otherness that I’ve felt since forever, rather than because I truly identify with those labels. All I know is that I keep obsessing and feeling anxious over it. I just want to feel at peace with myself.

I'd like to know how you feel about this, what would you change to improve it and so.  


Here is the answer I gave:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Most people are born with a set of chromosomes that dictates the way your body is. It's tied to your complexion, your genitals, the amount of hormones your body generates, etc. In nearly all of the cases, there are two distinctions which are male and female. That's your sex and that's how you are born and how your body works by default.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Now, we aren't just flesh and bones, we people evolved in too many aspects and we live according to some society set of rules. Historically, sex influenced how a person should behave, how a person should look, etc. As time passed, this idea of how you should be according to your sex ""is your gender"" as in ""social gender"" and not ""biological gender"".   
  
&gt;  
&gt;So we have always assumed that there are 2 genders. Male and female. A or B. Left or right. But when you start thinking about it you can say some people is ""manlier"" than other, which implies that gender (that set of rules) is not A or B, it's something like an interval between Female and Male so people is not just ""male"" or just ""female"" they may be 20% - 80% for example.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;Some people started thinking about it and realized that maybe they aren't always ""20% - 80%"" they sometimes feel 20-80, sometimes 30-70 and sometimes 90-10. This is just how some people feel and that is just a fact, there is people that feel that way and therefor this way of thinking exists.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;So, what's non-binary gender? Non-binary gender is a set of rules that doesn't fit neither in the ""male gender box"" nor the ""female gender box"". It may take a few rules from that ""male gender box"" and the ""female gender box"". And maybe some of those rules don't necessarily fit those boxes and diverges from them.   
  
&gt;  
&gt;This can be explained with more detail, facts or examples but I'm not an expert or anything and this topic evolves and changes from time to time because it's tied to society. The best way to get to understand those things is by reading, talking, be in some other people shoes, etc.﻿

Male and female. A or B. Left or right. But when you start thinking about it you can say some people is ""manlier"" than other, which implies that gender (that set of rules) is not A or B, it\'s something like an interval between Female and Male so people is not just ""male"" or just ""female"" they may be 20% - 80% for example.   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Some people started thinking about it and realized that maybe they aren\'t always ""20% - 80%"" they sometimes feel 20-80, sometimes 30-70 and sometimes 90-10. This is just how some people feel and that is just a fact, there is people that feel that way and therefor this way of thinking exists.   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;So, what\'s non-binary gender? Non-binary gender is a set of rules that doesn\'t fit neither in the ""male gender box"" nor the ""female gender box"". It may take a few rules from that ""male gender box"" and the ""female gender box"". And maybe some of those rules don\'t necessarily fit those boxes and diverges from them.   \n  \n&gt;  \n&gt;This can be explained with more detail, facts or examples but I\'m not an expert or anything and this topic evolves and changes from time to time because it\'s tied to society. The best way to get to understand those things is by reading, talking, be in some other people shoes, etc.\ufeff\n\n&amp;#x200B;', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I tried my best to answer ""What the hell is non-binary gender?\ufeff"".

I’m slowly getting there with figuring out my gender. I have the desire to be seen as androgynous, and have thought about T and transmasc things, but is that just overcompensating for being a female or actual desire to transition? I feel very disconnected from stereotypical femininity, and I really want to not be seen as a girl. Socially, I’d like to just be me and not act or try to pass as either gender, whereas appearance wise I do feel drawn to masculinity (facial hair/shape, voice, hair). I feel like if I had these qualities I could be okay with femininity every now and then, and it slightly makes me sad that I feel so constricted by the discomfort around that now. I definitely get gender euphoria whenever I get my hair cut or feel like I’m looking right.

1.  I'm AFAB.  I identify as nonbinary/agender, on the basis that my gender identity is mostly comprised of vague hand-wavey gestures and shrugging.  I do not identify as a transman or as a man in any way.
2.  In spite of this, while my preferred pronouns are they/them, I kind of really dislike she/her and any references to me that assume or state femininity (work boss addressing an email to me and several women with ""Morning ladies"" or similar).  I kind of hate my birth name and shorten it to a masc variant, and kind of like it a little bit when clients mistakenly refer to me as Mr in correspondence.
3.  I have only recently come out to friends/family, and therefore for most of my life have just dealt with feminine terms and pronouns being used for me.  There is only one person in my life who has consistently always affirmed my identity in how they refer to me and talk to me, and I treasure them for it.

Now.  Recent things.

1.  Gender-affirming friend, who did not know I was now out, recently accidentally used ""she"" and ""her"" to refer to me multiple times in a single conversation and I swear it almost gave me whiplash. Although I am used to it in general from other people, and although the context was them *describing a theoretical conversation they would have with a third party who did not presumably know my identity*, it felt really weird and unpleasant to hear those terms coming from his mouth.  (Note, friend was awesome and wonderful when I mentioned it and made extra effort immediately after and I love this dude with a ferocity for that).

2.  I have recently been exploring my kinky side more and have discovered that there is one very, very specific context in which I do enjoy being referred to in feminine terms.  And this is specifically in a kinky D/s subtext (terms like ""good girl"" etc for example).  And I do not know what to do with this information.  It's like the only context in which femininity feels right for me is when I'm being rather thoroughly... well... it's kinky BDSM stuff in which I'm the sub.  

3. In discussion with one of my doms about this, he suggested if I was curious about exploring that more he'd be happy to try calling me ""good boy"" in some contexts instead and I feel like I had both a positive and negative reaction to even the idea of that, simultaneously?  I do not know where to go with this or how to feel about it.

I guess I'm just wondering...

1.  DAE experience a weird whiplash when someone who normally affirms your identity makes a minor error that you are normally way more able to handle when it comes from other people?

2.  DAE who does kink stuff get additional complicated and possibly even contrary Gender Feels when in specifically kinky contexts?  WTF is this and why does it cause such a strong and unexpectedly positive reaction in me?

3.  Does anyone know of groups on reddit or elsewhere that cater to NB kinksters where I could maybe talk to other people and get some... I dunno advice?  Perspective?

I know this is a common experience leading up to top surgery, but the kind of social dysphoria one experiences as an agender enby feels really isolating sometimes. 

I’m a part of a couple different to surgery support groups and they are great communities, but the vast majority of folks on there are trans men or trans masculine. I never really see anyone who looks like me. I’m currently almost 3 months on T, but an incredibly low dose that I only plan on taking short term to deepen my voice. After top surgery, I’m still probably going to be read as afab. And I think I’m nervous that my dysphoria won’t go away because of that. Like yeah my chest is my biggest “tell” which is why I want it gone, but I’m also nearly 33 years old and am a parent of a preteen. I’m past the baby trans days where I’m being read as a smooth faced teenage boy. It’s not that I *want* to be read as male, I just would rather get stuffed into that box because it means they aren’t seeing me as afab.

Can anyone relate? I’m lucky to have a lot of wonderful trans friends, and the most amazing trans partner anyone could ever ask for so I have plenty of community. But I don’t really have anyone who is also agender and can relate to the catch 22 of wanting that inbetween and knowing you can never really have it because society has such binary vision.

566,2019-01-20 21:29:06,ai2kji,6,1,"Hey all.  After a long period of questioning, I'm starting to get more comfortable accepting myself as NB.  Over the course of this year I want to go on a gradual process of altering my appearance to look more androgynous.

One thing that's been on my mind lately is my hairstyle (or current lack of style).  I'm not bald per se, but my hair is definitely thin in places and when I brush it a certain way, it tends to emphasize the thinness in a way that I personally don't find flattering.

I've thought of long hair but I find longer hairstyles to get uncomfortable in warmer months (or if I'm in a warm place).  What I'm thinking of is some variation of an undercut, though I've never gotten one before so I'm not sure how I would describe one to a stylist.

(Also, I have typically gone to Great Clips to get my hair cut.  I'm not sure if an undercut is something that I should go to a specialized place for instead, maybe a queer-friendly spot?  I'm in the Seattle area, so I do feel like there are suitable options available but I've never done something like this so I'm not sure.)

Another thing is I'm visiting family in late February, I'm not out to them yet, so I don't want to visit them with this kind of haircut yet.  I'm thinking of getting a haircut between now and then that would be a subtle ""preparation"" for an undercut, like, maybe have the sides/back short but not buzzed completely, and keep letting the top grow?

Then when I'm back from my visit and have let the hair grow again I plan to get a true undercut, and hopefully if I like the shape I'll be confident enough to dye it (never done this either, but I really want to try it out).

Here are some different views of my head so you all have an idea of what I'm working with:

**tldr;** This will probably read a lot like a rant. If you'd like to save time, the summary is that I don't know if I'm non-binary, or if I'm a cis-gender woman with a sexist view of what it means to be a woman.

\---

Still want to read? Well, if so...

&amp;#x200B;

What does it mean to feel ""like a woman""? Is it by the way I dress, the way I think, the way I look at other people? If I'm *not* a woman, what are women? What do I use as evidence to prove I am or am not a woman?

How do I know if I'm non-binary, or just deeply sexist?

When I was a little, I despised anything I saw as ""girly"", because I considered it frivolous. I didn't consider myself ""boy-ish"" either, and I would describe myself in my head sometimes as a ""he-she"", or a girl with boy-ish tendencies. Even that didn't quite fit, and if I were to describe how I see myself now, it'd probably be as ""femme-neutral"".

Is this a sign? Or was I a tomboy?

At least right now, I don't want to dress androgynously. Or do I consider ""androgynous"" to be something it isn't? I wear dresses and jeans and heels and sneakers. For awhile I did wear makeup, and now I don't. I'm growing my hair out, I'm constantly evaluating how cute or pretty I am, I hate my chest sometimes.

Does there need to be a theme for me to be non-binary?

I have a fiance that's straight all the way. I want to be woman enough for him, but I get depressed that I am. I don't want to be inferior, I don't want society's expectations of me. I want to experiment, but I don't know what I'd change. Perhaps I'm just scared. Perhaps I'm right where I should be. Or I'm not, and that'd be wasting our time.

Is this just indecisiveness? Am I hurting him? Is this hurting me?

Pregnancy terrifies me, because I don't want to be a mom. I think I'd want a kid, just not from me. Whenever I hear anyone say what ""a woman's place is"", my immediate reaction is that ""I never asked to be one"". I wonder what I would choose if I was asked. I think I'd put it off forever.

Does not liking the ""woman's role"" make me not a woman?

584,2019-01-21 14:51:55,aias1z,1,1,"Or my delusions of such a thing, depending on how you look at it.

First things first: I'm not an incel. I lost my virginity at 16, and I am entirely capable of forming and keeping long-lasting, committed, sexual relationships. In fact I am in a 10-year-long-and-still-going relationship.

But this still kills me inside sometimes. I wish it didn't, but it does.

It kills me that I will _never in my life_ know the playfulness of mutual attraction and flirting and casual sex because I'm only ever material for SERIOUS BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS.

I've always been a fucking acquired taste. No fucking body ever thinks I'm attractive from the get-go, as far as I know. I don't think I even register as a sexual entity to non-bisexuals. And then even with bisexuals it takes me a good 1-3 years to grow under their skin and for them to notice that well fuck yes they actually like me in _that_ way.

On the other hand, I'm quite averse to the prospect of getting physically intimate with a stranger, because what reason do I have to make someone feel good if I don't care about them, regardless of how hot do I find them? But every single one of my friends of any gender either IS or HAS BEEN such HUGE SLUTS that if you cut my arm, I bleed distilled 99-proof envy. In fact I don't even listen to their stories anymore, I just sit there silently with glazed eyes doing something else.

I've never had the chance to explore my sexuality outside of commitment, and I never will. And even if I had, I wouldn't know what the fuck to do about it, because my whole romantic life has been either 100% commitment or 100% unrequited crushes, and therefore I've been pretty much stripped clean of any playfulness around the subject.

I feel like I have 0 sexual agency. I can be into almost any sort of person, but in practice I'm strictly limited to whomever falls head over heels for me first. People don't regard me as either a man or a woman. It's like I'm an ""it"", an alien or a robot. Barely a human altogether.

_Other people_ have this thing where they engage in social interactions with the express purpose of finding someone to copulate and/or cuddle with, and miraculously this intention doesn't exclude them from the goal itself, meanwhile if I have the same intentions I automatically become a creep (except for people who are in love with me).

As soon as I give off any vibes of unrepressed sexuality, people look at me like I'm High King Pervert - Yet at the same time, of all the people I know, I'm THE ONE with the capacity to keep their pants zipped up when chances are good that zipping them down is going to have unpleasant consequences.

I've had _not once_ made successful sexual or romantic advances to people of any gender. Every person that I've gone to bed with was somebody I dated long-term, and that only after months or years of friendship, then fessing up, discussing the issue and agreeing that we'd rather be together.

Every person I've tried to flirt with or woo has declined with various degrees of tenderness or harshness, or ignored me.
 
I've been variously described as ""too lusty"" (by people with more partners than me, lol) or ""a boy with a lesbian's aura"" (by people who have dated lesbians, so  that's cool except it doesn't really work out in real life), ""too asocial"" (being social has never helped my sex life one bit, even when I was), ""attention too spread out"" (this is built into everybody single and willing).

The moment I dare to speak up in real life about how I feel about all of this, accusations of entitlement, misoginy and ""giving too much importance to it all"" start flying.

* #1 - Entitlement: I don't think people owe me anything at all. In fact I'm not the kind of person to push someone for sex. **Somehow, the people who _expect_ to fuck 3 or 4 different people in a week, never have their potential entitlement or lack of it brought into question.** And yet I have had a friend complaining to me that maybe ""he had lost his mojo"" because he didn't manage to score with anybody in his first 2-3 weeks in a new country.

* #2 - Misoginy: I don't give a flying fuck about the gender or equipment of anybody I'm into, at least _prima facie_, and I don't ever make gender distinctions when talking about flirting and sex life. The last time I said or thought ""women/girls do X or want Y or Z"" was about 10 years ago. I plain don't think in such terms.

* #3 - ""Giving too much importance to it all"": **Somehow, people who spend hours on tinder, or talking about their recent sexual exploits, or are willing to fly hundreds of KM just to bang somebody, are never questioned about, maybe, giving too much importance to casual sex. The same goes for people who are known cheaters, or who are willing to juggle 4 or 5 uncommitted partners - nevermind the accumulated headache of dealing with so many people intimately.**

TL;DR #1: The contrast between my life and that of my peers makes me painfully aware of nonbinarity

TL;DR #2: If I'm not regarded as either a man or a woman I might as well fucking run with it.

TL;DR #3: The jury is still out on whether I'm demisexual or not.

597,2019-01-22 01:49:56,aihriz,7,1,"Hey wonderful people,

Recently I've been working on figuring out what I want to do with my future. I've known for the past four or so years that I am nonbinary (with a leaning toward the masculine), but for the past year or so, I've been trying to figure out what exactly that might mean for my future. I've been weighing the possible pros and cons of taking testosterone, and while I'm far from making a decision, and want to see some sort of gender counsellor about it, I've made a little bit of progress in figuring it out.

There are definitely some things I would really like about testosterone:
- I really like the idea of having more facial hair (I'm fortunate in that I'm already quite androgynous, and have the ability to grow some scruff), and even if I decided it wasn't for me it could be shaved.
- The fat redistribution sounds great, though I know it's not permanent if I decided to go off of testosterone.
- My voice is already quite deep and in the androgynous range apparently, and I'm somewhat nervous about the change, but I think it would be something I would like given that I always try to speak as deeply as I can, and get dysphoric when I sound higher pitched.
- Doing some workouts, combined with testosterone, might help to make my already very small breasts seem smaller. It'd be great if I was fortunate enough to be able to bypass surgery that way, though I know that might not work.
- I'd be pretty okay with extra body hair. My arms and legs are already quite hairy so I don't think I'd mind hairiness elsewhere.

The possibility of hair loss isn't great, but it's not too strong in my family and if necessary it could be avoided by coming off of testosterone.

The main obstacle is, to me, bottom growth. I'm completely okay with my downstairs situation as it is currently, because it feels closest to having nothing there at all. I know that bottom growth is unavoidable on testosterone, and that if I want any of the changes I've listed, I will have to deal with stuff going on there --- but the idea of that makes me feel really uneasy. I think I'd be relatively okay with it if it could be hidden? But I know that might not be possible. 

TL;DR: I suppose I'm asking if anybody else has been in the same situation --- feeling very drawn to looking masculine, but not wanting to go too far and becoming dysphoric about looking/feeling too much like a man. Has anyone any experience with bottom growth in this regard, if they'd be comfortable sharing?

I'm all of those things (hello!) and it really kind of bothers me that if I want to look androgynous, I have to go for a transmasc style. The androgynous styles I love are the flowy, gothy, elven sorts, with long hair and eyeliner and flowy layered skirts and long coats and painted nails, and it really bothers me that that just falls squarely into lightly alternative feminine instead of something androgynous and transgressive (emphasis on trans)? I like my style, I like all my flowy skirts and my long hair (I cut it short and dyed it teal a couple years ago, and I prefer it long like it is now) and my eyeliner and my long painted nails, and I don't WANT to transition. I don't want to swap out my feminine androgynous for masc androgynous. I don't want to go on T (I like my smooth face and my soprano singing voice and I have plenty of body hair as it is) and I don't want to start wearing, like, jeans and flannels instead of leggings and skirts, just to be visibly androgynous. I would like a smaller chest, but it doesn't give me dysphoria, and currently I'm fat enough that I need my larger chest to aesthetically balance out my stomach and hips (and I don't think I have much chance of hiding it under a binder either); I don't think I'd want to change that unless I could lose about 75 pounds and keep it off. 

Sometimes (often) I doubt if I'm even actually nb, because I fall so squarely into feminine parameters. Like I said, I'm not dysphoric about my current flesh prison (would i like it to be different? yeah, absolutely. my ideal presentation is something along the lines of ""delicate goth elf prince"" and that's not really possible for a number of reasons) and I don't mind she/her as pronouns, and while I do prefer my online nickname to my birth name, while my nickname is technically androgynous it sounds quite feminine (Hiri, from Sindarin Hiril (Lady) but also right in the midpoint to Hir (lord); i've considered changing my username but hirilelfwraith flows a lot nicer than hirelfwraith and also i've been hirilelfwraith for something like 10 years now). It's one of those things where I can't tell if I'm just doubting myself or if I'm just ~trying to be special~ by inserting myself into communities where I don't fit (I also regularly doubt whether or not i'm Actually bisexual, which is fun). 

Is this something anyone else can relate to? Is this imposter syndrome or genuine doubt?

Hi everyone, I'm hoping to get some advice, perspectives, and, if possible, some help here.

A bit of background: I identify as a nonbinary trans man and I use he/him pronouns. I'm a person of color. I've been socially transitioning for over a year, have changed my name and pronouns with friends, family, &amp; colleagues, and am in the process of legally changing my name. I don't know if I can/should change my legal gender (I'm AFAB), because despite never having taken T, I look pretty masculine, but I am afraid that having ""M"" on my documents and having people read me as female \~50% of the time could be dangerous when I cross international borders, which I have to do frequently both for work and to see family who live abroad. Basically, as an enby trans guy who wants to look just on the masculine side of androgynous, I'm trying to decide which is more dangerous: having an ""F"" and looking male 50% of the time or vice versa. I would LOVE advice on that, but that's a slightly different discussion...

Mainly, I just want to see if anyone else has experienced their dysphoria like I am experiencing mine, and if so, what y'all have done about it. I am really struggling with my chest dysphoria. Since puberty, I've felt like my body is acting of its own accord, like I have no control over what my body is doing, particularly in terms of having very large breasts. (I'm okay with what I have downstairs, personally, though I do have some bottom dysphoria.) But having large breasts (EE/F cup) makes me feel like my body is not my own, and it's making me depressed and like feeling or wanting things for myself is pointless, because even my own body doesn't feel like a home. It's also very hard to exercise because putting on a sports bra makes me close to having a panic attack. (I think it's something about feeling the cups of the bra around my breasts, pushing them together.)

I've been binding for about 3 years now, even before I admitted to myself that I was trans, but my breasts have grown in the past 6 months due to birth control, going from a D cup to an EE/F cup. Now, with my chest so large, binding no longer relieves my dysphoria like it used to. I am also a pretty skinny person, so my breasts are extremely noticeable to me, let alone to everyone else, no matter what I wear.

I am really struggling with the idea of getting top surgery, feeling a lot of internalized messages of guilt about how many cis women would love to have my large chest, and feeling afraid that something will go wrong with the surgery. I feel like my breasts are so beautiful, but I just wish they were on someone else's body, that if the world ""needs"" beautiful large breasts (since society seems to love them so much and guilts me for wanting to not have them...), that someone else could carry them. I also feel like I've lived with them so long now that I'm afraid top surgery wouldn't alleviate my dysphoria, like--will anything feel right? Is there any way for me to feel like my body is actually mine? Is there a way out of this hell? Can my body ever be beautiful AND feel right?

Some days I feel like I should just give up and accept that my body is completely separate from my sense of self, that I have no ownership over anything between my navel and my shoulders, and try to dissociate as much as I can so that I can at least live my life. My breasts have been almost entirely numb since puberty. I think 20 years of dissociating may be the reason; it's just that dissociating doesn't seem to be helping me anymore.

tl/dr: I have EE/F cup breasts and terrible dysphoria, I feel like my body doesn't belong to me, and feel guilt for wanting top surgery. I want to dissociate to pretend I just don't have a chest, but after 20 years of dissociating, it's not working anymore. Has anyone else felt this way? Is dissociating from my chest for the rest of my life even possible? Or will this just get worse and worse? Am I alone in feeling this?

I'd really like to understand what makes a person feel nonbinary. Is it feeling that one doesn't fit in with normal gender stereotypes and is seeking another avenue? Is it feeling that one's body doesn't match their insides? Is it something else entirely? I'm really just ignorant in this area and don't want to be. 

The main part of what I'm struggling to understand is if it has to do with fitting gender roles. For example, I identify as a gay man. As a kid, I listened and danced to Avril Levine with my sister and played Barbies with her and her friends. I never didn't feel like a boy even though I was doing things often associated with girls. I never really thought of my gender as anything but a characteristic of body I was born in. Can you help me understand what makes a person feel nonbinary?

all the clothes were boring and i wanted to look at the women's stuff to see if there was something nice, not really caring about the gender of my clothes as long as they look nice and are comfortable. but i didn't feel able to, since my mother's ""are you insane"" looks really wear me down!!

**My question here is:** Do you know anybody like me? Do they (or you) identifies in some way?

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I don't have an identity. I do come out to people depending on their understanding. So it is trans, genderqueer, non binary, ftm. In a strictly binary world I would be a man, no doubt about it, but in a wider world I'm just... I? I almost always say that I'm a guy because in my language everything is gendered, so people have to speak TO me in a way or another. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Description of my dysphoria experience:*

I'm very guy aligned and pass most of the time, even my therapist jokes that I'm very binary and wonders if I am suppressing the idea to just be a man. My body has always been very masculine. I'm athletic and don't have much of a chest now. It looks like I have pecs and then there are these floppy tits lower down. I don't think much of them, I don't love them, but I don't dislike them either, especially now that have more hair on them. I see them as mine and not ""feminine"". Breast cancer runs in my family and it's very possible I will have to take everything away sooner or later whatever I have.

I consider my period a chronic illness that I forget about till it comes, luckily it's very short. I use a cup because wetting myself crushes my brain and I literally shut down if I don't wear a prosthetis, I always felt I have been mutilated. The idea of period coming back once I stop T doesn't bother me that much tho (but I wonder if it's because I don't really want surgeries and go bald like my father, so it sounds like a good enough compromise).

I need to lower my voice, it makes me feel feminine and gets me misgendered. I would love a broader neck, be hairier on my body. I would love if my face changes even a bit so I will have again medium-long hair.

&amp;#x200B;

**In short** I wanna be myself. I look like a thug boy with tits, I wanna look like a metal man with tits. I say look because I don't feel anything in particular.

I feel like I should have top surgery or change my sex marks because why not? I pass so much, why look weird? Do I want so much even an harder life? Am I not tired enough to be attached and mocked for my look or outed by documents? I am not a woman for sure after all, but I don't feel entirely like a man. I struggle to tell myself it's ok to be non-binary, and see myself there, especially when most of the times it seems to mean genderless or androgynous.

I got involved in a conversation with a Spanish speaker who was lamenting about gender-neutral language being an annoying 'trend' amongst younger people, and having to change from using masculine forms of words and greetings to gender-neutral ones.

Her example was this:

Instead of ""Buenos días a todos"" (good morning everyone), we are supposed to say ""Buenos días a todes"", or instead of ""los niños"" say ""les niñes"" (the E being supposedly neutral, opposite to the O=masculine and the A=feminine).

I acknowledged that I can't speak to a gendered language, but that in terms of using the correct pronouns, which may include gender-neutral ones, I just don't see why it's so hard for some people to adjust, why they don't think they should refer to someone as they request. It doesn't impact them at all, in my mind, they are just being stubborn and resist for their own skewed 'beliefs'.

There is a trend in English towards greater gender-neutrality in terms of job titles, saying humankind instead of mankind and not just using he/him when gender is unspecified/irrelevant.

&amp;#x200B;

I know they're not going to understand it, solely because non-binary genders aren't very well understood by most people... Also my dad doesn't really know about non-binary genders (as far as I'm concerned, I don't have a really good relationship with him), my mum doesn't really understand it, and my little brother will probably think there's something wrong with me. My family are kind of meh about me being gay, but they can at least tolerate it.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to start taking testosterone, cut my hair, wear more boy's clothes (although I do still like some girls clothing)... But I know my parents just won't understand it. I've been having dysphoria as far back as six years old, though due to me getting diagnosed with depression at around 13/14 years old, I barely feel dysphoria or any emotion at that now, because I just don't care about anything anymore... I'm 16 and still haven't transitioned. I want to transition but because of depression, I just don't care... I want to but my mind just doesn't care.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like if I transition and combat this dysphoria, my depression will go away, because I'll finally be happy with myself. I'm convinced my dysphoria is the reason for my depression.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been considering getting a job, but everything is an effort when you have depression, and some days I feel so awful I can't even get out of bed... So I doubt I'd do well at any job at this point... Also it would probably be hard to hide my self-harm cuts and scars on my forearms due to how some of the work uniforms are.

&amp;#x200B;

How do I come out to them? And by them, I mean just coming out to my mum tbh... I doubt my dad or brother would take this the same way my mum would. Could I perhaps leave a letter explaining it and then leave the house? Then again I still feel like one letter wouldn't sum it all up... Do any of y'all have some good tips for coming out as non-binary? If so, I'd be forever grateful if you helped me out.

I'm convinced my dysphoria is the reason for my depression.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been considering getting a job, but everything is an effort when you have depression, and some days I feel so awful I can't even get out of bed... So I doubt I'd do well at any job at this point... Also it would probably be hard to hide my self-harm cuts and scars on my forearms due to how some of the work uniforms are.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHow do I come out to them? And by them, I mean just coming out to my mum tbh... I doubt my dad or brother would take this the same way my mum would. Could I perhaps leave a letter explaining it and then leave the house?

844,2019-01-28 23:35:11,akto6t,2,1,"TL;DR- im AFAB and currently femme presenting and the constant misgendering is having a huge negative impact on my mental health. How do I deal?

* * *

So this is gonna be a rant and one I suspect is nothing unfamiliar to many enbys 

I’ve been out as GF/NB for the better part of 5 years. I made a huge announcement on FB and I even received some affirming messages from friends (and not so affirming chides afterwards at family gatherings). I work in very queer friendly circles, with other enbys and trans folk and ally’s who understand NBettiquete and my social circles are mostly made of the same, in fact my best friend works with me and is also an enby. I’m not super in your face about it, but it is known and reminded that I prefer neutral pronouns, I expect people to fuck up but as long as I know they’re making an effort I’m generally cool with it. However this has only been in the last year, because I sat through 3-4 years of not correcting people who misgender me; I snapped last year and got upset because the queer folk I mentioned above, my best friends, childhood queer friends, they never ever called me they/them until I got upset (i am also BPD and tend to overreact). I don’t like irl confrontation but I make sure all my social tags are explicitly enby, I often send reminders on FB, IG etc that I am, and 4 years of my friends liking the posts they never actually called me what I am. 

I know I should have been more vocal but I mostly snapped when my BFF came out, they made one status and then everyone was like “ok, C is enby, cool” and from thereon out it was explicit that that’s how it was. I made a status a few days later as a reminder. I started being more vocal. Friends got mad at me sometimes because they said I never mentioned it. 

I recently started dating a very lovely but (in the best way, ignorant) cis guy who makes me super happy and I love him to bits. He just honestly comes from a religious family and wasn’t taught about some stuff and I forgive him, but he’s only ever known me as an enby and tries but doesn’t really try. Same with my workmates and boss and friends. They say they’ll do better when I correct them and never do. My partner will warn me before I meet his friends “sorry but they’ll probably call you ‘she’” and is apologetic but also constantly misgenders me to the point it feels like he doesn’t try. 

I’m uncomfortable that he makes big deals about making sure his fam and friends KNOW I prefer they/them but doesn’t seem to use them. Frankly I didn’t want announcements, I just wanted my pronouns used normally by him and friends and corrected sometimes. 

I used to look a lot more neutral but decided to grow out my hair so I do present as femme right now but I also have very neutral things about me. 

I suffer from a lot of mental health issues (GAD, GDD, ADHD, BPD, ED, BDD) and am a spoonie.

I guess I currently identify as a cis female lesbian. Since I was around the age of 16/17ish (currently 20) my gender is something that I seemed to question every now and then.. 

What I’m struggling to figure out is if I’m NB or if I just like to present as a more masc/andro female? 

Things that make me think NB are things like wishing my facial structure was more masculine, that my voice wasn’t so feminine, for my boobs to be even more non-existent than they already are (I’ve considered binding but that seems rather restrictive and uncomfortable). I also really hate my name it’s undoubtedly a girls name. I know these things don’t necessarily make you NB or not. But I guess i have a constant struggle of wanting to present less feminine as quite a small petite (I really hate that word but it’s all that works) human 

The things that make me think well maybe I’m not NB is the fact that those things don’t bother me tooooo much? Like sure they’d be fucking great but what can I realistically do about it?

I also get pretty excited whenever someone doesn’t immediately assume that I’m female. Most recently I was out clubbing and someone had to ask one of my friends what my gender was and it felt like an accomplishment of sorts? Idk it was good. 

I guess I’m wondering what your thoughts are? If you’ve had similar feelings and what not? I don’t have any trans friends (irl or online) to chat to about these things so..

[AMAB] My initial coming out to myself ~9mo ago was actually while browsing /r/genderfluid, and what got me to start examining my own gender, and would keep a journal of my day to day experience of gender (and sexuality while I was at it). About a month later I had a straight week of gender euphoria like I had never experienced before, and coupled with a slightly shallow reluctance to take on any kind of genderqueer label, I decided I must be a trans woman.

And then that feeling wore off, but I kept trying to force feminity on myself and it... guess what? made me dysphoric. So I suppressed for ~3mo. Oops.

Then about 4mo ago it all crashed back down on me just how inauthentic my life was and I renewed my vigor to be transfem. And in that time I've experienced enough tumultuous euphoria and dysphoria to be entirely confident that there's no chance I'm cis.

But even after 2.5 months of transfem HRT and a whole lotta steps and comings-out and wonderful affirming moments, there are still non-insignificant stretches of time where being a boy still feels inaccurate, but being a girl certainly doesn't feel accurate either. And times that the idea of being female is *more* dysphoric than being male. It's to the point where I'm recognizing that I'm searching far and wide for other people who consider themselves binary trans who will fit the things I'm experiencing and coming up shorter and shorter every time. 

So I've thought about it for weeks and weeks now and... I'm taking another shot at discovering an identity that describes my experience. And... **I feel free again!** It's like the two 40lb weights that are the gender binary have been lifted from around my neck. **Not wanting to have to explain another gender to cis people is a DUMB reason to lie to myself. So today I'm gonna stop using that excuse!**

I'm looking forward to learning from this community, other genderqueer communities, and the wealth of enbies in my IRL trans spaces. A lot of getting back to this point has been normalizing non-binary to myself, and I still have a long ways to go!

But that's not why I'm celebrating today! Leggings are probably the articles of clothing I own the most of already. The big thing for me today was that I didn't go shopping for yoga pants like I was committing a crime, dressed in a black hoodie, sweatpants, and sneakers rushing to get in and out of a Wal-Mart unnoticed. I wasn't huddled between clearance section aisles cringing every time I thought someone saw me. I didn't grab the cheapest thing I found because I had to guess my size. I didn't pray for a self-checkout. 

This morning, I carefully chose my outfit (nice leggings, long shirt, chelsea boots with a slight heel), did my makeup, grabbed my new leather tote, and went to an outdoor mall. I walked into a premium store. Inside, I said hi and chatted and asked for help from all the really nice people working there. I picked out several different types of tights in different sizes and asked for a changing room. When they asked for my name, I gave it with a smile, and they wrote it on the whiteboard on the changing room door with the word ""yoga"" underneath and a bunch of hearts around. When offered help, I asked for more sizes. And when I thought I found the right one, I walked out and asked for opinions. And when I had the perfect pair, I paid for it while opening a loyalty account. I could not believe how absolutely kind everybody was. Nobody, customer or worker, treated me differently.

This is a victory for me, because I decided I deserved to be kind to myself, be proud of myself, and nurture myself, not just the parts society has deemed appropriate to do so given my genitalia. Nobody needs a $100 pair of leggings, but when I have these on, I know that this part of my identity is no longer treated like it's unwanted and unloved, handed only scraps to survive. Rather, it is a cherished part of me that deserves to be seen, acknowledged, and treated well.

It took a while to discover the proper terms and whatnot, but, being somewhere in the middle always felt nice, like removing your socks after a long day, or finally feeling more connected to the person I wanted to be. 

I had a name picked out, one I still use today in online communities and with people I trust. 
It's masculine. Very masculine. It's Felix. A very stark contrast to the name I was given, which, surprisingly, is neutral, but it's not me. 

I had harbored this 'secret identity' name for years, and due to the frequency of online time vs. real life social interaction, I became Felix. It felt more natural to be called this than it did my birth name. 

Still young, I kept this secret. I kept it for years, really. 
Nearing adulthood in legal eyes, at age 16, in mid Fall, I decided I wanted to have a coming out for my name. 
My mother had already known something was up. 
My identity, both sexuality and gender wise, wasn't a secret, but it was kept swept under the rug. 

Lifting up the rug was hard. 
It didn't go well. 
The first time I hinted at wanting to change my name, it upset her. She didn't scream, yell, or break things, but the emotional intensity was all the same.
I had hurt her. It was my fault. 

Days later, we discussed what had happened. With tears in her eyes, she told me the story of holding me in her arms, her 'sweet little girl' and named me. Changing it would be removing something she gave me, a part of me that wad a part of her. 
We've always been close. This was like an arrow through my heart. I couldn't imagine hurting her like that.

Yet, inside, I was hurting. 
The topic was dropped, still simmering, a bubble in the rug that felt as if it would trip me at any moment. 

Time passed, the issue wasn't as hot button. 

It was Christmas soon, wounds still fresh in my mind, I was a bit emotional. 

We began to pull out the ornaments, handcrafted family heirlooms, at least to us. 
Many were painted, made by me. 
Many had my name on them. 

(Name)'s first Christmas
(Name) age 4
Mom and (Name)!

I felt the worst combination of emotions. Guilt, self disgust, like I was betraying my family. That I would be a new person, and if I changed, those made-with-love ornaments would only be an upsetting reminder for my mother. I didn't want to do that to her. 

That night, I sat on the couch with her, head leaning against her. 
I quietly told her that I did not want to change my name. It was a phase.
She seemed pleased. Relieved. 

I felt bad for lying, but that wad drowned out by the fact I had fixed her worries. 

It's February. The new year, I'm soon-to-be older. It's been nearly 5 years since I became Felix, yet I am only that in the closet. I am only Felix behind closed doors. 
And now, I know I cannot change, not without hurting the person I love most.

Guilt, self disgust, like I was betraying my family. That I would be a new person, and if I changed, those made-with-love ornaments would only be an upsetting reminder for my mother. I didn't want to do that to her. \n\nThat night, I sat on the couch with her, head leaning against her. \nI quietly told her that I did not want to change my name. It was a phase.\nShe seemed pleased. Relieved. \n\nI felt bad for lying, but that wad drowned out by the fact I had fixed her worries. \n\nIt's February. The new year, I'm soon-to-be older. It's been nearly 5 years since I became Felix, yet I am only that in the closet. I am only Felix behind closed doors. \nAnd now, I know I cannot change, not without hurting the person I love most. \n\nAll because of the sentiment of a name. \n\nTl;dr: Name change would hurt my mother, and I feel guilty."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'The Sentiment of a Name', 'created': 1548888812.0}"

**TW: thoughts of suicide, gross big ball of dysphoria**

So I'm very much in the closet but out to people who i trust/think will accept me.

I went with a friend of mine to a new years thing with a buncha queer people, in the house of a trans guy, and like only my friend knows im trans. So i kinda was like if it comes to it imma come out idc if they know, also cmon its a trans guys house they're all accepting of trans people and don't judge right? 

I was feeling pretty femme and adorable too.

So we go there and we play board games and listen to music and shit and one of the girls is like ""you look like Tom Holland"" and i got really really uncomfortable and said, yo, that makes me uncomfortable, and she's like nonono he's super cool and handsome, and I said well i don't like being compared to men and she totally ignored that.

Then someone called me cis and i was like im totally not cis, again, everyone totally ignored that. Trans guy started calling me a man and said we're the only men in this room, and i was like please don't say that.

Then girl compared me again to tom holland and i was like please, don't compare me to men, and tyey totally ignored that.

And then i made a remark that im totally not straight and they assumed i was a gay man even though i said right afterwards that i get crushes on every girl that's taller than me. 

And i got compared to tom holland for a third time and i again said I'm really really uncomfortable with being compared to men, everyone totally ignored that

And like at some point i realised that nobody is really listening to what im saying at all and there's no reason to even be here cuz i whatever i do/say is totally ignored, plus I'm perceived as a man and nothing i say makes a difference anyway and i probably look super man and gross, I felt as if these femme vibes i saw the last few days in the mirror were just me deluding myself that i look like something i am not. I went to the bathroom and saw a manly man staring back, when a few hours ago i had seen a really androgynous girl looking person. i just went to bed and cried for half an hour. 

I felt super ignored invalidated and like everyone sees me as a man, the femme feel i had got replaced by hyper intense dysphoria and it was absolutely terrible.

I felt like absolute dysphoric shit and thought about suicide this morning too, but I'm better now.


But likeeee how does one deal with this? Like i could have just yelled out yo bitches im a fucking trans woman but with every shit comment and every ignore i trusted them less and less and got less and less comfortable coming out to them. 

Plus like people I'm out to say i look feminine and like a woman but obviously that's a lie since nobody even thought i could be not a man even when i told them, yo I'm not cis at all.

Its hard to ask for help here but I am asking humbly as I know I need as much help as I can get. Please, if you can view, share &amp;/OR donate to my campaign to support me in the surgical side of my transition it would mean so much to me. (Gofundme.com/michellestransition). These surgeries mean everything to me in terms of ridding me of this dysphoria and crippling anxiety and fear I experience every day. 

It would mean the world to me having the users of Reddit for support during this. 

If you can't donate that OK! But sharing my campaign alone spreads awareness and physically makes a huge difference in my life. 

Please everyone I need your help on this one. 

With love,

As I came out as a homosexual who destroyed your hopes and future about how you wanted me to be what you wanted. I know I should have just been a boy as I was 17 instead of coming home and introduced another boy to you.

Peak of that when I slowly cracked all my fear and my protective shell to be brave another to confront you and let you saw me slowing changing on my transition to be ""exactly who I am"" as a ""woman"", as a girl, as a female you found yourself shocked and I know especially when in year by year, my appearance became clearer and clearer enough to make you notice at least my changing in dramatically way and there's no chance to deny the way I know I'm now representing about all your miserable as parents who failed to raise a kid to grow up to be just normal like other kids with their match on their sex or gender.

I'm not going to talk about how your expectations got me destroyed by labeling as a stupid kid who disappointed you guys not having a good GPA for years just because I didn't want to bring my homework to do with you because afraid for how you guys always turned to be aggressive on how I didn't understand the match or how I can't write ABC and that's how I spent 6 grades in trashy rank of competition I knew I never win and I knew you thought I was the big fail and the mistake you ever had and disappointed you.

But as I remembered many times when I did all chore clear and clean and forced to be real life Cinderella since 6 who did all house work like I was your maid or slave while you guys just sat there, digging all shit about my grade and HOW I DESERVED TO USE MY BODY ON WORKING HARD to replace what I never been excellent like studying. But I remembered when I hit the good grade at high school with A+ and B+ but never ever receive any compliments from you and how did you appreciate me, especially you father, you told me many lies about you'll give me the prize ""of trying"" but I never saw it's coming. And I hope you know why I did have trusting issues when I'm 27 now.

I know I'm 27 now and I never called you on the phone daily and I never come home in every 2 times a month and sorry that I never gave you any money as you expect and want me to do it as a GRATEFULLY CHILD, of course because you think you made me. You think you created me. But like if I have a chance to say that I never want to be owned by you, I didnt want to be born to live this miserable unworthy life and feeling like garbage living in this world.

At least, I know in your eyes I'm still a male child to you where you both even try to understand how hard I'm living my life as a transgender woman who has a real woman stuck inside this ugly body. And has to fight against hatred people give me the whole to just ask me could I just die? because I am different.

Even how I got discriminated by people not to give me any job even I never committed any crime or even I have skills and abilities and my patience to work and improve but I ended up rejected and wasted my time. And now you both said the same about ""JUST MAN UP, PRETENDING TO BE MAN AND WORK"" at least in that casino where you'll be a boy and serve, why? ""because we thought you have ability""

I said ""mom, my ability is better and far away then just that casino""

Over the holidays my sisters adult child  came out to us all as trans (MTF), to a fair amount of surprise. She's always been quiet, and (looking back) likely depressed the last few years , but none of us ever thought it was more than the semi-normal coming of age angst?

Our family is accepting, very chill/non-religious , but the reaction from her Dad has been one of sadness, worry and confusion. My sister is just straight up worried about the entire process: the potential medical, financial, personal safety and social consequences.  There's lots of love here- they still have weekly dinner/games night together, and are generally supportive of her choice, just- quietly freaked out with concern for her.

**Question:**

Is there a way for someone, who is in particular into that in-between part, to find someone, without being disrespectful to them? I don't feel comfy bothering someone who is trying to change to become themselves to stay in that middle ground, because I like it the most. Are there some people out there who stick to that middle ground to?

**TL;DR** 

I'm into Femboys and similar male androgynous types and don't desire to be disrespectful towards those meeting that requirements (MtF) but are actually up to a further journey. How to find the right ones and handle the ones I don't suit to properly

**Background:**

**About me:**&gt;!I'm a guy, and as my profile may show I got some tendencies to femboyish or other types rather than guys or girls. In the game second life, that I discovered 5 years ago when I was 18, I never had played as a guy. At first as a girl, then (that's the ingame title of that gender/role, not my invention) shemale, and since a few years now as femboy. I love everything about it. The whole subculture, that is pretty deep and rich. But its a game on the internet rather than the real life. And there is not really able to go for that. I'm tall AF, quite, but not extremely masculine and more, so going for that look is something I keep in that place rather than take it out. !&lt;

&gt;!I have been toying with the idea to find a SO that meets my preference of being androgynous or similar. I know it's not that easy since in the most part, cross-dressing and stuff still sadly something most people rather not show off too public (at least according to those I talked to in person. They keep it in safer environments, but that makes it hard to spot them if you don't frequent those), and looking for someone that is trans from MtF for example would most likely not enjoy to be reduced on the status quo and move on to fulfill their goal of finishing the transformation, as far as I can tell. !&lt;

**Problem:**&gt;!Running into someone in the wild was always a quite rare occasion, so the by pure luck method is kinda hard to pull off. Looking out in particular for some type would require some knowledge, how to properly handle the topic. The community in SL is pretty raw and bloody honest about stuff and quite upfront, but I can't really say that for my RW experiences. The few people I met so far tended to be rather shy about the topic and it took a while to even learn about it.!&lt;

**Naive Bonus Question:** 

Are there places to meet such people more likely or is it normally distributed among the typical places people who search to go and meet, such as general bars 'n stuff?

91,2019-01-04 04:17:11,acecpt,7,1,"I made a lowkey dysphoric post almost a year ago and got memed on egg_irl for it, and ever since then I’ve been thinking more and more about the idea of transitioning. I think I have some very real reasons not to pursue it though. I really just want whoever is listening to let me know if these reasons are just bullshit or if I’m making some sense 

1: I definitely don’t fit into the common narrative. From the trans people I’ve spoken to to what I’ve read online it seems that most of the time the experience is “I knew I wasn’t *Assigned gender*, and I was never going to be able to be mentally healthy without transitioning.” I don’t really feel that way. I would definitely much rather be a girl than a guy, but being a guy is not making me seriously miserable. It’s more of a bummer in my life, a minor inconvenience, than something that is making me profoundly unhappy. 

2: My family would absolutely not be supportive.  I’m not close to my father, mother, or stepmother anyway, and my grandmother (my only adult family member I’m really close to) would support me anyway. What worries me isn’t that though, it’s that I would almost surely be cut out of my much younger sibling’s lives (for reference, my sister is 9, my brother 4, and I’m 17). I’m also relying on my parents to pay for college. My career and education are definitely my biggest priorities (more on that in #3). It’s very likely my parents would stop paying tuition if I were to come out and start transitioning. 

3: My ultimate career ambition is to be a politician or otherwise work in public policy. The vitriol and hatred that trans people receive is already horrifying, and I couldn’t imagine trying to be a transgender public figure. Not to mention the fact that just now we’re getting the first transgender people in elected office, which is to say that it would make being a politician a hell of a lot harder. I’m not sure I have the mental fortitude for that, and frankly, my career goals are my life goals. I feel, at least right now, that I’d rather be unhappy with my body than fail at my career goals. 

4: I love my girlfriend, and I don’t imagine she’d still be interested if I were to transition. (Not that I’m necessarily blaming her, she’d be supportive just she’s straight) 

5: I’m used to not being happy with my body. I’ve been overweight since elementary school, and I figure if I’ve never taken the simpler efforts to make me more happy with my body (as I’m eating healthy and working out), why would I do something INFINITELY harder (transitioning)? 

6: Being transgender is a huge, identity defying thing. For people that know about it, it’s one of the first and biggest labels assigned to you in their perception. I have other parts of my identity that are more important to me. I don’t feel like my mild desire to be a girl is such a big part of me it should overshadow other aspects of my identity. 

7: Y’know, all the regular societal reasons people don’t transition. (Being worried about using the bathroom and having no legal protection are large barriers)

97,2019-01-04 07:20:51,acfs7t,0,1,"Back story. My childhood best friend is FTM. We met in middle school. He started T around 2014-2015. Prior to identifying as male, he engaged in sexual activity with cis-males. At this point in time, you could call him bicurious and then bisexual (began experiencing with cis-females) shortly thereafter. After this, it escalated to lesbian. Then dressing like a male and strictly dating cis-females (still identifying as female at this point in time). Next was identifying as male and using male pronouns. Then of course starting T shortly after that.
Due to multiple relocations, my friend has been on and off T. Sometimes for months at a time because of the difficulty obtaining a prescription. We had a discussion about that at one point in time and I expressed my disapproval, but he informed me he believed he was fine because his ""body was auto producing testosterone now."" Obviously, not true. Not to the milligram needed, anyway. Regardless, he soon found a doctor in his town willing to prescribe and the doctor even increased his dose by 0.5MG. Well, due to unforseen circumstances, he had to relocate back to our hometown recently and was seeing his initial T prescriber again. The doctor basically told him that he will not be increasing the dose like the new doctor. End of story. If I remember correctly, he is currently without health insurance at the moment and/or has decided that T is not enough of a priority to spend finances on. During this time, he has cheated on his girlfriend as of 2 weeks ago and is an alcoholic. He is also now romantically involved with a male he met online. I didn't ask if the male was cis-male or not because it did not seem important at the time, but now I wish I had because his behavior is incredibly out of character lately and I think it is attributed to having stopped T and potentially experiencing bouts of dysphoria. The reason I wished I had asked is because, historically, he is attracted to women. Always has been. Just because that person may identify as male, perhaps in my friend's mind they're still female to him? Only he could answer that. I don't know. There are some other things going on behavior-wise in addition to him experiencing normal life stressors such as finances and strains on relationship. I'm not saying there is something unusual about an FTM being in a relationship with another FTM or cis-male, but I was honestly just taken aback by these confessions because I know my friend and all of this is unlike him. Is it possible that now that we're adults, this is just simply the person he has grown into? Or does anyone reading this find any of this concerning based on all the information I gave? I'm just really worried for my best friend's mental health and poor judgment lately and want some input on how I should approach this if you think that would be an appropriate thing to do.

I have three major fears:

- Any name I pick will suddenly become gender neutral. I don’t pass at all (pre-everything) and having an exclusively masc name is important.

As soon as I declared it my name someone would either say it’s gender neutral or I would straight up meet a girl with that name. People also mispronounce my current name to feminize it more.

- It’s annoying to the people around me, especially the friends who had known since before I came out and who’ve called me 3 or 4 names by now

- It won’t feel right. Aside from the gender neutrality seen above, a lot of the names just don’t feel right. Honestly I’m scared I’ll never find a name that fits me. Maybe this is linked with the first reason but it’s still hard to choose a good name.

113,2019-01-05 03:15:18,acq4cm,16,1,"Vent post, warning for internalised transphobia

I (19M) went out with my (mostly cis lesbian) friends tonight to a gay club for the first time. 

I can’t really dance and I don’t drink so clubbing is always weird, particularly because I’m always trying so hard to act masc and not be “caught faking,” but tonight I was... hoping for something, I don’t know what I fucking wanted. I was distracted all night, because wow, *guys kissing, guys dancing* whereas usually I don’t even let myself fucking look at guys when I’m out because I’m trying to act like I am one, so I guess I take advantage of having so many female friends who like to grind on me and try to act like I’m het. But even tonight I caught myself feeling fucking guilty for looking at them because I’m not a *real guy,* right? They didn’t come here for a straight girl to check them out. (I’m not one, I’m not one, I know I’m not but when I got back to my flat and looked in the elevator mirror... I tried so hard when I was heading out- new jacket, even fucking... stole Dad’s good aftershave- but no. No.). 

I just. There were gay guy friends with us too and I don’t know. They can dance and they’re all so fucking tall and I got misgendered so many times. I know I don’t pass, especially when it’s been this many weeks since I’ve braved the barbers, so I don’t know what the fuck I was thinking. It just really hurts. Like physically, I feel it in my fucking throat. I want so badly to be wanted. I feel like I’d give anything for someone, *anyone,* to look at me like I’m worth their time, even for ten minutes. 

No-one has ever liked me- well, two people thought they did- but they were both closeted and they liked the idea of me, because I was already out and open and a safe inbetween where I’m not a real guy so it’s not that gay and I’m just so “confident and comfortable with my identity!” (Hahaha yeah fucking right.) I rejected both on that basis and lo and behold, they confirmed it was transference after they came out and got real boyfriends. 


I’m nineteen and I’ve never held hands with a guy, or been on a date. So it’s probably especially bad to be thinking that I’d take anything from anyone as long as it was based on just *want*, but it’s how I feel. I’m just sick to death of being “the cute soft boi” to my cis friends. I didn’t ask for the big eyes and the long lashes and the extremely snappable wrists and the height that’s the first fucking thing anyone who gets told I’m my father’s son comments on (“I thought you’d be taller!” I get it, you’re an asshole!) 

Sorry, this is stupid and unclear. I just feel like everyone has someone and it hurts. I want to do something stupid, like find someone random to hook up with on the internet just to prove that someone would. I feel like I can’t relate to other trans people because they’re all so proud of it but I just want to be cis so bad. I wouldn’t want to be straight, but I just want to be cis. Both gay and trans is too hard. I’m so lonely and it just fucking aches and there’s no way to fix it, not when lgbt spaces in big lgbt friendly cities make me feel like a fucking outsider too. There’s nowhere for me to go. It’s like getting a fucking glimpse of Eden through the gates. It’s perfect out there, but there’s no fucking ticket for the likes of me. No fucking ticket.

Fast-forward to two days ago. Some girl clothes I ordered had arrived, and putting them on made me feel really good. I almost felt euphoric like I did back in January of last year, the first time I wore girl clothes (can't believe it's been a full year since then). I felt so good that on a whim, I just slapped that estrogen patch right on my leg and took half of a Finasteride like I was prescribed to do.

Within a few hours, I felt amazing. Two days later, that hasn't gone away yet. I feel so in sync with my body. This is entirely placebo, but my skin already feels softer. I swear it's glowing.

I can't believe I was so back-and-forth about this. I can't believe I was so afraid and uncertain.

When she came out to me it took all of 2 seconds for me to say “ok, that’s cool” or something like that. I knew that nothing would change the experiences that built our friendship, and I am very accepting of people for who they are at the core. I did say that it will take me a little while to get pronouns correct all the time, and that garnered a chuckle. I could tell she was relieved, and nervous at first to tell me. A few weeks prior we were at the movies, and towards the end of our post movie contemplation conversation about the word, science, and our friends/family she had said in not so many words that we were going to have an awkward conversation another time. 

I was able, and excited, to start calling her by her new name as soon as she had picked it out. My wife and I were thrilled for her that day that we got to meet Her! I still get pronouns wrong once in a while, and correct myself right away. After 10+ years of using masculine pronouns, I knew it would take me a little work And apologized ahead of time. 

I’m pretty good now, and only get them wrong when talking about our past exploits. For the most part my friend was referred to by her last name in our group of friends. We had several of us with the same first name, so we all went by our last name. Made things easier. 

So now to my first two questions on this sub. 

1. What is the correct/best way to talk about my friend when I am talking about our past before she transitioned. 

2. Birthdays. Do we celebrate her original birthday or the day we met Her as the celebration. 


Because it’s not me, I’m choosing not to use either her name or deadname here.

130,2019-01-06 05:10:22,ad2m4g,8,1,"I hope this is okay to share here. 

Awhile back, a dear friend of mine - we’ll call her Jen - came out to me as trans. (For clarity: She was born with male parts, but I refer to her here now as female.) Nobody else knew except for my husband and Jen’s spouse. Jen married a woman a few years ago (we’ll call her Anne). Anne did not take this news well - understandably so. 

Jen and I talked a lot over the following weeks about her worries, her journey to this realization. She asked me questions and I made it very clear to her that I loved her regardless of her name or how she presented. I told her she could be a dinosaur and I’d still love her. Jen experimented with a new name for a bit. We send fun girl memes to each other. I told her that as she was figuring herself out and how she ultimately wanted to proceed, and I told her that even if she decided she didn’t want to transition or maybe wasn’t trans after all, she was free to be whoever she was without judgement from me. 

Jen’s wife discovered that she had shared this all with me and was very angry. She felt I was undermining her and working against her, trying to ruin her marriage. So with Jen’s blessing, I reached out to Anne to say that I loved her too (the four of us were pretty close) and was here for her, and wanted her to know I wasn’t pushing Jen to do anything. That my main goal was to make sure Jen felt loved and not alone. Anne told me to “mind my fucking business” and a few other surprisingly cruel things, demanded I never speak to her again and blocked me on every platform possible. It surprised me, I’ll admit. I expected some misdirected anger but it was more than I anticipated. 

Jen and I continued chatting and remained close as always. She kept saying how thankful she was for me and how I’d helped her to feel like she wasn’t alone. And then suddenly Jen went MIA. It scared me. I feared the worst. Finally she told me she just needed some space and I said okay. We spoke a few more times when Jen initiated and then over the last 6 months I’ve reached out a couple just to let her know I was thinking about her and hoped she was well... She replied a few times, and a few times not at all. 

It’s been a few months and today I send a text. It appears my number has been blocked. 

In a way I’m not totally surprised. But I’m still really sad. A quick perusal of social media shows that Jen and Anne are still together, which I suppose I’m happy for, and Jen appears to still present as male. No  judgement or anything there.

But I’m really heartbroken. Jen and I were friends for nearly a decade. I viewed her like the family you choose. I suspect Anne may have demanded Jen cut us off and that is really sad if so. 

I’m here because I thought you guys might have some more perspective to lend here. I’m trying not to feel heartbroken about this or focus on how unfair this feels to me. It’s not about me. Jen’s the one going through something significant. I suppose I have to just accept it for what it is and move on, but I’m struggling to do so and not feel somewhat bitter. I’m trying to remind myself that it’s not about me, but I’m having a hard time with that.

I’m looking for trans perspectives to help me write an inclusive initial agreement for BDSM that will keep both sides validated and comfortable. This includes different prices and safety stipulations for different biosexes / genders. Please keep in mind this is quite a sexual community, so biosex vs gender limits are valid concerns. 

I strongly dislike AMAB bits and everything to do with them, as I am in short terms a lesbian. I intend to have separate stipulations for AMAB and AFAB bodies. However, since I am part of the female domination community, I feel like I may also encounter a trans man who wants similar treatment to how I handle cis men. 

I also intend a clause for non-binary (which here is used for all genders not firmly cis or trans- is there a better word?), but because of the statistical rarity, it may simply have to be something for later down the line. If you have any extra information, I am more than happy to lend an ear (or even both of them)!

Do you have any suggestions on where to draw the lines between gender and biosex, and how these issues should be treated?

Are there any groups I’m forgetting?

But then one day something in me cracks, and I realised this fetish shit is covering up something bigger, pushing it down so I can't get to it. I realised that my real desires were being warped by my porn addiction. I adopted the personal mantra that 'maybe the things I'm ashamed of aren't the things that are wrong with me'. I pledged to embrace and explore my obsession with 'crossdressing', and examine earnestly what it meant to me... if only it were that easy.

&amp;#x200B;

Weeks pass and I'm knee deep in books of all kinds - basically anything related to gender. I feel better-ish but shame and confusion still crop up from time to time, feelings strained by trying to explore all of this while living in a long term relationship. Oh yeah, I should mention that I've also come out about all of this (sans the porn angle) to my de-facto wife at this point in the story. She didn't take it well and while we managed to carry on happily enough the whole thing ended up staying a personal journey. I talked to her about it sparingly sometimes, but she didn't really want to confront it, which made me withdraw. So now I'm dressing up every single time she leaves the house and laughing with glee in front of the mirror like a real silly-billy. This goes on for a few weeks and I begin to get depressed because I can't make sense of it or express it as openly as I'd like. I plunge myself into online games and alcohol and forget about it, developing a smouldering angst as a result.

&amp;#x200B;

Life goes on and I'm lurking on the crossdressing sub and I stumble upon a comment linking me to egg\_irl. This is where shit gets blow open for me big time. I devoured everything on that sub, relating to everything all the while. I began taking quizzes, filling out anything and everything that billed itself as a kind of 'trans test'. I couldn't stop. And, I admit, I think I was looking for things that confirmed this burgeoning feeling within me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm signing up to reddit and actually creating content and interacting with people (this is BIG for me; I don't socialise online EVER). I've begun to think I might actually be trans but the thought absolutely terrifies me. And yet I can't stop thinking about being a girl, can't stop combing through my personal history like some kind of mental detective, isolating every little thing that seems to point towards this fact I never even considered until recently. I keep stopping myself from believing its true but at the same time I'm just as scared that it might not be true. Lately I've been asking myself if I could go back in time to my childhood would I choose to live it out as a girl? And I really feel like my answer is yes. My whole sense of self has fallen apart in a few short months and I am so confused. I feel like I'm walking through a haze. I can't focus. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I feel queezy all the time and my heart feels like an empty cavern. And to top it all off I'm trying to figure all of this out while going through a slow and painful separation.

&amp;#x200B;

I talked to my mum (amazing woman) about seeing a psych the other day. I didn't tell her the real reason why but she just thought it was because of my failing relationship. She's been a social worker for a long time and I trust her to point me in the right direction. Anyway, she hooked me up with a place that I called up a today. I don't know if they're the right place for my situation but I figure that at the very least they'll be able to help me find someone more appropriate. Now I'm on a three week waiting list and I know it's not actually that long a wait; but with the way I feel right now three weeks seems like an eternity. This whole thing feels more real to me than anything else I've ever done in my life and every day feels like more wasted time.

So, I’m just gonna say what I want to.  And it will not be liked by some.

Gender is a false construct.  It’s purpose is specifically to bring about the destruction of biological sex distinction. So people can do the bloodly hell what they want with their bodies, whatever the consequences for themselves or others, or society. 

It is radically selfish.  

It’s radical individualism.  To the extreme.  It’s a refusal to acknowledge reality and it’s a retreat into an ivory tower of seclusion from reality itself!! 

It’s utterly staggering and profoundly sad.

From the trans ivory tower, a person is totally secure.  Because everybody else is to blame for everything.  Nothing is the persons fault.  They can do no wrong.  These people are mentally ill, often severely mentally ill and have suffered trauma from a young and very young age, that they may not be aware of, but controls every aspect of their lives.  Their suffering is severe.  

But, it’s no excuse for their actions.  

Trans people a victims par excellence.  The manipulation of others is reprehensible.  The damage that this dogma is doing to trans people and potential trans people and society is alarming!!!!! 

So, I’m now going to talk about it from a Christian perspective, which will probably piss a lot of people off, I don’t know.  But the truth hurts, even when it’s spoken in love.  

So, ultimately, trans people are sticking their V’s up to the creator of them.  And in rebellion saying, you made me, I’m going to remake me.  So there.  I want absolutely nothing to do with you God, I hate myself and everything.  And I’m going to lock myself up in this ivory tower and throw away the key.  (What you don’t know is, God can easily get in that tower, people are so stupid) 

It’s radical rebellion.

But their decision, in-fact cuts them off from reality, itself, and any possibility of any help at all to overcome their almost insurmountable inner anguish and turmoil. 

And the truth gets harder now.  Trans people may change their sex in this life.  But they won’t know this.  But every human is an eternal creature.  And when after they die, and God raises them up on that final day.  (Google it, or read revelation, in the bible) 

They will be given new glorified bodies and that body will be the body they were born in.  They will inhabit that body forever in eternity.  (As an adult) In one place or another.  There are only 2 places to go after death.  

And have people read about the founder of modern gender theory.  A man who said paedophilia is ok!  

I’ll post some links.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Money

Just read about John Money, and what he did to one boy/man.  And how both brothers committed suicide and the parents blame John Money.  

A theory and a whole framework of belief and understanding about something that isn’t true was set up by this despicable man.  (in my opinion).  And is being propagated and propagandised around the world!

We need to stand up for the truth.  And stamp this awful doctrine of death out.  By telling the truth lovingly to others. 

Because otherwise, your child might be next.  

And I have had a horrendous life, suffered unimaginably.  More so than probably most trans people.  So I know the depth of their suffering. 

But they still need to hear the truth.

And it is possible to recover and even overcome severe early childhood trauma.  But sadly, because it’s staggeringly difficult to overcome.  Lots of people give up.  Throw their hands in the air, look for the easy option, oh I’ll be trans.  And then your lauded by every idiot under the sun.

It’s not societies fault you are trans.  It’s your choice.  

You know why the trans lobby is winning.  Because our education system is so dreadful, generally.  People have lost the ability to think for themselves.  And they are just regurgitating pathetic tropes about inclusion, equality, tolerance, acceptance.  You’ve heard the nonsense.  

Sex change is being encouraged to youngsters all around the western world.

If anyone even mentioned trans to any child of mine in school.  I would have them removed immediately if the school wouldn’t take my concerns seriously and change its policy.   I suggest you do the same to.

Your children’s lives are at stake!  

I would encourage Carl’s family to be loving but firm!  With him.  And if his behaviour continues. I suggest they cut him out of their family.  

These people are destructive and hell bent on destruction.  Whether they know it or not.   (I’m not making the point about them going to hell here, I’m saying this is their attitude in life, to others, it really is) THEY ARE THE HATERS!!!  Of everything!!! And they say others are haters.  Oh the irony.  Wake up people.  

You might as well put an M16 in each trans persons hand and send them into a shopping mall with and endless supply of ammunition.  For all the damage that they are doing to others and society.

This is the stark truth, people.  

(And none of this is abusive!  And if I get banned or blocked from this site for this message, I will take it to the highest level through all the proper channels) 

I am not transphobic.  There is no such thing.  That word was created to demonise, those who often lovingly and despairingly may want to help these people.  And to keep the trans people safely locked up in their ivory towers.

If you want to live in your ivory tower in unreality.  Then go and live there.  And shut up and leave us all alone.   We are completely sick and tired of the utter, staggering ridiculousness of it all.

If you can’t even realise that no one was born in the wrong bloody body.  Then there is absolutely no help for you at all.

Goodbye.  

And I would/will not use pronouns, I will not call you by anything but your biological sex name.  And so should all other people do as I would/will do! 

Go have your pity party somewhere else. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  Get back to reality.  And get help for your mental health issues.  

And the cost to the tax payers for all transgenderism treatment is making everyone else poorer!  🙄

It’s just childishness.  It’s like an adult trying to have a conversation with a very wounded 5yr old.  

Do you trans people know how utterly exhausting it is to even think about you or have a conversation with you.

I had one trans person, purposely message me on here with the intention of starting a fight with me.  Look through the comments, the trans person actually messaged several people and picked fights with them.  

Trying to spread their unreality, hate and harm people. 

I went out of my way to be gracious with said person and they just stonewalled me.

(in my opinion).  And is being propagated and propagandised around the world!\n\nWe need to stand up for the truth.  And stamp this awful doctrine of death out.  By telling the truth lovingly to others. \n\nBecause otherwise, your child might be next.  \n\nAnd I have had a horrendous life, suffered unimaginably.  More so than probably most trans people.  So I know the depth of their suffering. \n\nBut they still need to hear the truth.\n\nAnd it is possible to recover and even overcome severe early childhood trauma.  But sadly, because it’s staggeringly difficult to overcome.  Lots of people give up.  Throw their hands in the air, look for the easy option, oh I’ll be trans.  And then your lauded by every idiot under the sun.\n\nIt’s not societies fault you are trans.  It’s your choice.  \n\nYou know why the trans lobby is winning.  Because our education system is so dreadful, generally.  People have lost the ability to think for themselves.  And they are just regurgitating pathetic tropes about inclusion, equality, tolerance, acceptance.  You’ve heard the nonsense.  \n\nSex change is being encouraged to youngsters all around the western world.\n\nIf anyone even mentioned trans to any child of mine in school.  I would have them removed immediately if the school wouldn’t take my concerns seriously and change its policy.   I suggest you do the same to.\n\nYour children’s lives are at stake!  \n\nI would encourage Carl’s family to be loving but firm!  With him.  And if his behaviour continues. I suggest they cut him out of their family.  \n\nThese people are destructive and hell bent on destruction.  Whether they know it or not.   (I’m not making the point about them going to hell here, I’m saying this is their attitude in life, to others, it really is) THEY ARE THE HATERS!!!  Of everything!!! And they say others are haters.  Oh the irony.  Wake up people.  \n\nYou might as well put an M16 in each trans persons hand and send them into a shopping mall with and endless supply of ammunition.  For all the damage that they are doing to others and society.\n\nThis is the stark truth, people.  \n\n(And none of this is abusive!  And if I get banned or blocked from this site for this message, I will take it to the highest level through all the proper channels) \n\nI am not transphobic.  There is no such thing.  That word was created to demonise, those who often lovingly and despairingly may want to help these people.  And to keep the trans people safely locked up in their ivory towers.\n\nIf you want to live in your ivory tower in unreality.  Then go and live there.  And shut up and leave us all alone.   We are completely sick and tired of the utter, staggering ridiculousness of it all.\n\nIf you can’t even realise that no one was born in the wrong bloody body.  Then there is absolutely no help for you at all.\n\nGoodbye.  \n\nAnd I would/will not use pronouns, I will not call you by anything but your biological sex name.  And so should all other people do as I would/will do! \n\nGo have your pity party somewhere else. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.  Get back to reality.  And get help for your mental health issues.  \n\nAnd the cost to the tax payers for all transgenderism treatment is making everyone else poorer!  🙄\n\nIt’s just childishness.  It’s like an adult trying to have a conversation with a very wounded 5yr old.  \n\nDo you trans people know how utterly exhausting it is to even think about you or have a conversation with you.\n\nI had one trans person, purposely message me on here with the intention of starting a fight with me.  Look through the comments, the trans person actually messaged several people and picked fights with them.  \n\nTrying to spread their unreality, hate and harm people. \n\nI went out of my way to be gracious with said person and they just stonewalled me.  \n\n🙄🙄🙄\n\nI don’t hate trans people, I despair for/and of you!

My dad still technically has joint custoday of me with my mom, I'm 16 and my parents have been divorced for a while. So Mom still has to drive me to my dads and try to get me to get out of the car. (She understands that I'm not getting out and all I have to do is tell her I'm not getting out then we can go home).

Anyways, today we were doing that, and my Mom tried to call my dad to see if he wanted to talk to me. Dad did not, and it turned into a phone argument between my mom and him.

The reason I'm writing this post is because he claimed that ""nobody is on his side."" Which I found to be strange, I thought everyone in my Dad's family group would be on his side. Most of them are Republican and pretty religious. But either way, a lot of people I thought would be totally against this aren't, actually.

So turns out I'm so unlucky that out of all my family group, the one person who's transgender coincidentally has the dad that is the least trans-supportive. (Like even if I wasnt trans and wanted to wear girly clothes he would say no).

Idk this is a dumb post but it made me think a lot.

TL;DR - my dad is the only super transphobic person on that side of the family, and I didnt expect that.

256,2019-01-10 18:10:43,aelo98,14,1,"So about a year and half ago I started dating a girl.  At the time I had just started poking my head out of the closet but I was still not sure where I stood on the gender spectrum.  I was heading more down the path towards MtF but I felt the need to attempt a relationship/sex with a ciswoman because I never had much experience.  I'm also into kink but wasn't sure if I was a dom dude or a sub girl.  So I started talking to this girl and we went on a few dates.  After a couple dates she came over to my place and started having issues that ended up with me needing to take her to the ER.  Nothing major, she just wasn't eating enough and it was causing issues.  She really had a lot of issues which weren't immediately apparent to me.  She grew up with a mom who abused her in many ways and had no support network.  

So then we start dating and less than a week later she tells me that she had a falling out with her roommate and didn't have a place to live (and no where to go since she had a crappy job and no support network).  So of course seeing her in trouble i wanted to help and offer her my place until she could get onto her feet.  Then the next week she lost her job and suddenly I had to support the both of us.  She went 8 months without a job.  Spent a lot of time sleeping all day and watching TV (she said she was applying for jobs but she's so picky).

When I started dating her I thought that she was a sub and into kink but as it turns out (I basically told her), she's actually a little which is not at all what I'm into.  Furthermore I don't think I could be a dom even if I wanted to.

I've tried to break up with her before and it didn't go so well.  She gets panic attacks and starts acting irrational.  She tried to kill herself one time and had to spend 3 days in the mental health clinic.  She started getting some assistance at that point but it didn't make much of a difference for me.  We share almost nothing in common.  She has essentially taken me away from my family and friends, effected my job performance, is fiscally irresponsible with my money, and even worse I'm pretty sure I'm MtF and she's said in the past that she doesn't like Tiffany (my chosen female name) and that she feels threatened by her (and thus I haven't been able to be Tiffany except for once or twice for an hour over this time.  She even knew about this side of me a long time ago because on our second date I showed her a picture of me and told her I'm unsure of what I want.

I don't know 100% why I'm posting this but I guess I want some advice and encouragement on how I can get out of this toxic relationship.  I'm very afraid to confront her at this point as I don't trust her to react rationally.

TLDR:  I've been dating a mentally unstable girl who is a little for the past 1.5 yrs and we have nothing in common and I just want to end it and be able to explore being Tiffany and I'm very scared of ending the relationship because she hasn't reacted rationally to previous attempts to breakup.",trans,I made a horrible mistake and have been living with it for the past year and a half and I don't know how much longer I can take it.,1547169043.0,"{'created_utc': 1547143843, 'id': 'aelo98', 'num_comments': 14, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""So about a year and half ago I started dating a girl.

I'm dreadfully uncomfortable in my own body. Words cannot describe how uncomfortable I am. I would forfeit my life savings and then some to have the body of the opposite sex. Opposite pronouns? I would love that shit right about now, but I'm terrified that it's some fake thing that I'm feeling, that I've been feeling for years. I know my family would not support me either way, but I plan on moving out, sticking with some friends maybe. But coming out to people I know, I don't know if I could handle that. I know they'd support me either way, but. I don't really know how to feel. I dislike generally feminine things, especially despise she/her pronouns. Messed around with they/them for awhile, but it isn't as comfortable as he/him is.

I want to be comfortable with myself, that's the priority. I'm not sure how to get to that point, or where to start. I feel like I don't know enough about transitioning to even consider it.

274,2019-01-11 13:34:27,aevez6,2,1,"Hey...

today I realized that I can't take it any longer. I have to finally take my life into my own hands. But there are some things preventing me to do so... A little backstory... 

Two years ago I got to the conclusion that I have Gender Dysphoria, that I can't live on the way I am. Always being good with my family I thought they would probably support me, so I asked my dad, who was upstairs at this point, if he could come down to my mother because I would like to tell them something. He didn't want to until I told him what it's about. Still feeling like he would support me as good as he can, I did it but had soon to realize it was my greatest mistake... 

As I told him how I feel about who I really am, how I just can't live on the way I am. He said nothing at first, didn't flip out or anything. He did something far worse. He put the greatest emotional pressure onto me, telling me about how he fears to be sick, though he didn't want to tell me what it is, however he made clear that he needs me the way I am to get through this. He basically told me „You'll kill me when you do this“. I just couldn't, just couldn't anymore, I locked myself in my room and started crying. He knows I love him, that I would never want to hurt him and he drops something like this at the moment I'm most vulnerable? Telling me how he could be dying? Basically hitting me with both fists directly to the face I just couldn't understand the world anymore. He said he needs me the way I am, the thing is that this is NOT who I am, that was the whole point behind our conversation... 

But I couldn't just couldn't. Despite how hard it was, how I felt about me, my body and my life, my future, I couldn't bring myself to be so egoistic to risk someones life because I put myself over them. 

It's actually funny when I think about it out loud, how I've basically been told that I would kill him by doing that but it's the only way to stop whats slowly getting me more and more sick and not far from killing me... He basically does what I can't. I don't know how he feels though and hearing he may be sick is extremely hard to bear as he told nobody except me at this one point. But how can he even think that I can endure this when he tells me something like this in a moment like that? How can he think I wouldn't be there for him in the time of need? Does he even think that? I have no idea... 

I couldn't continue and even though it hurt I also couldn't flee and do this on my own, he needs me, he said it himself, so continuing to be what he wanted me to be he stayed supportive in any other matter now only occassionally throwing in passive agressive „My SON“'s. Everytime it hurt more... 

He has been such a great father, supporting me everywhere he can but this? Why does he do this? I always thought him a great man, was I really so wrong? I knew I couldn't keep this play up for long and today is the day I finally want to end it. I can't look into the mirror without disgust anymore, everyday I feel like throwing up and crying and screaming, I can't dream of something else anymore, if I sleep at all. I pushed everyone I could call a friend away from me. It's basically all or nothing for me now... 

I have no doubts I can do this alone, be happy again and find new people to be around, but the fear gets the better of me. The fear of what might happen to my father, I still love him so much despite what he is doing to me, I can't be so egoistic and end up risking his life. The fear of what happens to my family, what if I break it apart by doing that? My brother is so short of finishing his school, this would ruin him. At this point I have the feeling my life doesn't belong to me anymore. 

I have no idea how to get out of this, what I'm supposed to do or if I even CAN do something about it. I can't take all of this any longer... I want to flee, I want to end this play, but I can't just can't. But what should I do?

301,2019-01-12 07:26:40,af568x,1,1,"Alright so I'm an 18 y/o trans girl in southern United States and I've been friends with a group of people in this Discord server (a trans Twitter friend owns it and it contains a bunch of her friends) since around May 2018. I've started talking more intimately with one of the other trans girls in the group, she's 21 and currently resides in Denmark.

We added each other on Snapchat and talk regularly, this goes on for a few months. Then she admits to me that she has feelings for me, then later asks if I think we could ever be ""more than friends"". After this she suggested we watch Netflix together while in a Discord call. We do this every day now. She's made further hints at being interested in a relationship with me, first starting with playing ""36 questions"" which is a set of questions which I found out after a quick Google search is mostly meant for couples. Then earlier tonight, she sent me a screenshot of a message that a mutual friend of ours sent her, where they said they think we'd make an ""ideal couple""

Now I'm not sure where I should go from here. Normally in an IRL situation I'd be like ""hell yeah sign me up, let's go on a date"" but this is different. Here's a few issues I have...

She hasn't seen much of me, just a few very carefully selected pictures that look particularly nice. (I've seen plenty of her, I know she's adorable)

I'm not particularly attractive right now, HOWEVER, I'm (probably) only going to look better with time. I'm losing weight quickly and I start HRT in a few months, after that I'll be getting laser hair removal and doing some other things that are going to make me look a lot nicer

She's far away. I can handle a long distance relationship for a little bit, but I want to be in a situation where we can be together/near by as soon as possible.

Now here's another thing, I can't really imagine there being a much better time than now (or soon) to pop the question. So... Does that mean I should just say fuck it and do it? I'm super confused.

Growing up I never thought I would have to be worried about being lynched. I never thought I'd have to be worried about where I could live within my own country so that I was less likely to be murdered for simply existing.

I'm pretty open about the fact that I'm transgender, although I've been told that I am cis-passing. ""I would have never guessed/known!"" gets thrown around when I first come out to people. 

Now, I'm considering taking a higher position within the company I work for, and that would include moving to a new city, and very possibly a new state. I'm used to moving around, but this will be the first time that I've done somewhere new since I came out just over 2 years ago. 

It's terrifying because I realize I have to worry about those things that I never had to worry about before. Plus, I'm not the only one who would have to deal with that: my wife (who I legally married in December) will as well. In the past, I've had the support of almost everyone I worked with and several nearby friends. In this situation I will only have my wife. 

On one hand, I won't have to disclose my status to anyone except my boss, and even then I only have to because my legal documentation (name and gender markers) hasn't been changed yet. Which is of course exciting.

On the other I'm not sure what to expect. I'm not sure how long it will take to get the doctors I need, find an adequate place to live, etc. It's a big unknown and absolutely terrifying.

So i've wanted to be a female ever since I was a kid. When I say that, I mean I had a DEEP desire as a very small child to be a girl. So deep that I actually came out to my parents when I was 7 or 8 years old. That took a ton of courage because my parents are country folks (they are wonderful parents, but...) it took a TON of courage to do so. They didn't really know how to handle it, so I just said ""i'm kidding"" to de-escalate the situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

You see, the thing is that I thought it would pass. I was very mature thinking for a kid, and I decided to just keep the feeling to myself and bide the time. Eventually it would dissipate, right? WRONG. Here I am at 24 and It has not only gotten stronger, it is starting to affect me negatively.

I don't want you guys to get the wrong impression, I am Texas strong and I work very hard and go to college. I'm not one to get slowed down by emotional tolls.

I have tried and done everything to ignore and get over it, but it comes back stronger and stronger.   


Finally, and I speak for myself and myself ONLY. I don't want to transition fully. The reason why is because I wanted to be biologically female. I wanted to bear children and breast feed, and grow up as a female. But I can never and will never have those experiences. So I feel like me wearing women's clothing and ""transitioning fully"" would only deepen the void. (like I said, this is me speaking for me, and how I feel about MY feelings.)

VAULT  Festival are currently running a competition with Stagedoor in which  the most liked/saved plays on the app will be given a lot of marketing  help, help that we couldn't afford otherwise, and help that would  transform whether people came to see the show or didn't realise it even  happened.

If it is possible, it would  mean the world if you could download the Stagedoor app and search 'Dead  Reckoning' (the name of the play) and save it to your events. That's all  that is needed - you dont have to commit to anything except saving the  event, and it would help get the only trans play on the programme seen  by others. I think theatre is still lagging behind with trans  representation, and we hope just by being at a festival like VAULT we  can play a small role in disrupting that. Any help getting there would  be appreciated by my lil trans heart. Jess (they/them) xx

The LSVD then goes on to cite instances where the German supreme court was positive about a ""diverse"" entry being necessary because it would otherwise offend the constitutional rights of inter\* persons.

The text goes on saying that these two in combination would - at least in theory - allow trans people to simply get a notice from their doctor to change their legal gender, a huge step after up until now trans\* people had to go through two different psychological evalutations and a court process(that would take months to years) to do so, costing trans people a lot of time and money(the average trans\* person would accumulate a few thousand Euros of cost for court and the evaluations).

First of all, my surgery will be on Thursday (Jan 17th) with Dr. Eric Bensimon.
Today’s a weird day. Remember as a child being so excited for a family trip the night before? So magical yet so frustrating. You just can’t believe how amazing tomorrow will be. That’s how I’m feeling. I’ve been waiting for this for so so long! Today I’ve been staring at my face in the mirror on and off. I swear a demon will appear in it soon! Also, I’ve been patting myself on the shoulder for finally reaching the finish line. I’ve always been thinking as myself as a sperm (weirddddd Allie!). It makes sense we’ve been in horrible situations to ensure our transition and survival and it seems like I’ve reached the egg and have to just wait a little for my body to fully form and burst outta that womb! 
I’ve already got my plane tickets for me and my bf from Toronto to Montreal. Planning on getting back with a train (I’m an anxiety gal and I’m not about to be walking around with a beaten up face in an airport!) I’ve been contacted by Brigitte from the doctor’s office to get everything done. Now, there’s a language barrier since she primarily speaks English but we got the work done and I’ve done a surgery before and know how to prepare for it. But if you live in Canada, I recommend making sure one of your French speaking relatives are available! (Every Canadian has one I’m sure of it haha). I think you can ask to speak to someone who’s very fluent in English. I didn’t bother to ask. But she has been very kind, patient, and helpful. 
I’ve decided to Airbnb my time there and they’re relatively like super cheap! Hotels in Montreal aren’t that expensive either. Make sure you book a place around the surgery centre not the actual office! It’ll save you money on Uber if you’re not driving. 
I’m getting my a complete forehead reconstruction and a rhinoplasty. My face is already semi feminine and I’ve always been out with makeup and people always gender me right (also don’t forget, Canadians are very nice people haha). But I’m really hoping for FFS to help me to get out of my home with a lot less anxiety and makeup! Also, FFS will not get rid of your dysphoria entirely. You might still look at the mirror and see a boy. But generally I think that because your brain picks up on your hard tissues as a way of facial recognition, FFS and directly altering the bone structure will help a lot. Also, hormones happen gradually but FFS is literally overnight. So, if you’re getting FFS be a lot excited for it! But still not a magic pill. The greatest help is from within. So if you have or are gonna get it and still aren’t happy with your results, there’s a chance that you might need to get some psychotherapy (also, sometimes nature is crueler to some of us and some doctors might not give us what we want). But, I assure you what you think is masculine or feminine is a lot less noticeable by others.

My parents forced me to come out after finding some feminine objects I had in my room like clothes. To sum it all up, it went horribly and left me in ruins. I still haven’t really fully recovered since and I can feel myself dissociating myself with being trans to try to stop the pain. I’m a very dissociative person in general but I don’t know how to stop it anymore. Ive been slightly depressed since and I can tell I’m subconsciously distancing myself from things I used to love like wearing feminine clothing or lipstick, etc. I’m not sure what to really do anymore as I don’t have the confidence or much of a will like I did before, when I could clearly say that I’m trans. 

I would say that my parents are mostly the problem but I also don’t really receive support at school either. I have 2 friends that completely accept me for who I am and even still, I still feel like I just can’t be myself anymore.

I still haven’t really fully recovered since and I can feel myself dissociating myself with being trans to try to stop the pain. I’m a very dissociative person in general but I don’t know how to stop it anymore. Ive been slightly depressed since and I can tell I’m subconsciously distancing myself from things I used to love like wearing feminine clothing or lipstick, etc. I’m not sure what to really do anymore as I don’t have the confidence or much of a will like I did before, when I could clearly say that I’m trans. \n\nI would say that my parents are mostly the problem but I also don’t really receive support at school either.

I don't know if that makes any sense. Just little things here and there that felt 'off' -- she was a bit too obsessed with ""boys do this and girls do that"" and would come home from preschool in tears be wise she was doing ""stuff boys aren't supposed to do"" and spent some time trying really hard to only do things boys did. 

So, we're driving home from school and she drops ""I'm a girl"" on me like we're discussing the weather. I didn't want to say the wrong thing, so I asked some questions like 'How long have you felt like this' and stuff, she's felt like this as long as she can remember. Feels out of place in her clothes and in her body. She never really seemed to care too much about what she wore, her dad got her mostly like sports shorts and t-shirts, but recently ish I tried to help her find her 'style' since she was starting kindergarten. Turns out, she hates all the 'boy' style clothes I had picked out. 

Me and my boyfriend took her to the store and she picked out two cute dresses -- there were a few she chose initially that were just too short and we had to say no, which kind of hurt her feelings -- and then I offered to help her do her makeup or style her hair. She's not really interested in makeup, which I told her was okay, and she wants to grow her hair out to braid it.


I'm just -- I don't know what to do. I want to do the right thing, I just can't even imagine what that is.

I looked up information on ""your child has expressed they may be transgender, now what?"" and it's all been very catered to post-puberty age groups, or like 10-12 years old. My kid isn't romantically interested in anybody girl, boy, or otherwise that I'm aware of just yet and that's what a lot of the advice has been that I found. It's all very much been just ""I'm not comfortable in my body"" with my baby. 


I did some reading about how most people knew from a very young age what they were inside and how they felt it didn't match their anatomy, which I can't even begin to try to comprehend how difficult that must be, so I don't know what words to use to support my baby through this. I don't know yet if this is a phase or if this is just who she is, I don't really care either way, as long as she's happy and comfortable with who she is.

My first conscious memory is of being at a friend's birthday party and wanting to examine her barbie doll. It wasn't anything sexual (I was 3), I was curious and the packaging looked neat. Someone at the party swatted my hand away and told me that the toy was for girls.

Ever since then I have experienced this dull, tearing, omnipresent pain in my soul. It's comparable to what I imagine it feels like when a surgeon leaves a utensil inside of your body.

It felt like a demon, and I did what you are supposed to do with demons, you seal them. In my late teens, the demon had grown too powerful... I was dying. I experimented with drugs and alcohol, anything to distract me from this thing. When I was 18 I went to my high school prom wearing pink. People told me I looked good. It was then that I realized that floral colors suited me. That alleviated just enough of my suffering to seal the demon away again and it returned to being that dull, tearing pain.

9 years ago I got married. My wife always found it interesting because she has never really been attracted to men before. I wasn't the first man she felt attracted to but she'd never really experienced ""passion"" toward a penis-haver.

Telling me this put a crack in the seal. It wasn't an emergency, I patched it up and was good to go.

4 years ago she realized that I wasn't an anomaly. She realized that she wasn't attracted to me in spite of me being a man. She was attracted to me because I **wasn't** a man.

As time went on, the now imperfect seal started to degrade further and further. Early this past December I admitted to my therapist that I experienced gender dysphoria.

This is how the seal shattered.

Ever since then the pain has gotten worse and worse. My sex drive has basically self-annihilated, I can't bring myself to leave the house, the more I think about it the worse it gets and I can't stop myself from thinking about it.

I don't know what to do. I'm in too much pain to do anything. I'm afraid of taking any steps forward but going back feels like suicide. I want to do all of these things but it's so big I can't figure out where to start.

I have one trans amigo I talked with about this but my intuition has been bugging me to ask someone else. I got reminded of a discord server called ""Transpeak"" and I wanted to ask for someone to hear me out there but I'm so anxious I just couldn't join the server. I don't want to give details as I don't want more people to hear my experience. All I will say for now is how I always was indifferent towards my male gender and how I actually feel pretty darn positive towards the female one.

  I probably am not trans though. I have no dysphoria. My emotions have been numb for a long time and I don't really understand myself well now. When I first flipped the switch for good I felt really euphoric for 1.5 days which is something extreme for my current emotional level. Weirdly enough, finding out this about myself also opened my emotional side a little.

 Thanks for reading this! If anyone wants to hear me out, send me a PM on Reddit. We can talk through Reddit or I can send you my discord name and tag there.

I recently flipped a switch that made me uncover another part of me. I have one trans amigo I talked with about this but my intuition has been bugging me to ask someone else. I got reminded of a discord server called ""Transpeak"" and I wanted to ask for someone to hear me out there but I\'m so anxious I just couldn\'t join the server. I don\'t want to give details as I don\'t want more people to hear my experience. All I will say for now is how I always was indifferent towards my male gender and how I actually feel pretty darn positive towards the female one.\n\n  I probably am not trans though. I have no dysphoria. My emotions have been numb for a long time and I don\'t really understand myself well now. When I first flipped the switch for good I felt really euphoric for 1.5 days which is something extreme for my current emotional level. Weirdly enough, finding out this about myself also opened my emotional side a little.\n\n Thanks for reading this! If anyone wants to hear me out, send me a PM on Reddit. We can talk through Reddit or I can send you my discord name and tag there.\n\n The only rule is ""no transphobia"" so I hope asking something like this is not against the rules.

487,2019-01-20 09:42:03,ahw3xd,0,1,"I apologize in advance for the lenght:

I started having Gender Dysphoria, when I was in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend about 3 1/2 years ago. Before that I was already very insecure about myself - not that fundamental - but regarding my sexuality. 

In the relationship I noticed that sex mostly is more work than pleasure and started having strong sexual fantasies about a friend of hers, who would always hit on me. I carried that around with me for a few month until I decided that it was killing me and im going to break up with her. Shortly before the breakup I startet having these thoughts that it might go deeper than just what gender(s) I'm attracted to.

At this point I was already severly depressed, because I cancelled my psychology study and had no point of orientation. Also I felt very guilty for breaking her wolrd, since she was very dependant on me and showed strong reactions. I started having panic attacks, when driving and felt all around miserable. I talked about this with my mum, but she couldn't really offer any help. She was not fully antagonizing me, but was surely not believing. Hence my parents pressured me to start something new, although I was in shambles.

Idiot that I was I started a study of mechanical engineering. I was not in a good place to start with, hence it was difficult for me to find a flat and so I had to sleep at different airbnbs for a few month until I got a place at the university dorms. Somewhere I knew, I wasn't really there to study, but to flew from my old home town situation. That's why I didn't apply for state support ( Germany ) and only had some savings left and the 300 € CP my mother sent me. That was not enough to live so I had some financial problems. I got more and more suicidal. I was scared that I would really reach the point of self harm, so I went to a psychiatry, where I stayed 2 month, but didn't talk about the gender dysphoria until my last theraphy session. I mentioned it and broke down and cried. The psychiatrist just said ""we might be on to something"", but since it was the last session I was just released without further help. After that I hung around at the university dorms until I decided it doesn't make any sense no more and applied for social care. I found a nice single flat and with some exceptions dwelled in it for several years until I reached the point where I told myself, it's not going to get better. You have to find a job. Money is not going to erase your problems but make them far more bearable until you know what you want.

I was not very confident in my skills, so I applied for an apprenticeship as a dietician in a different city, where I already had some friends. The outlook of having somewhat of a future, friends I could meet more often and fleeing that old flat, that I dwelled in, gave me a giant boost of energy. 

Well turns out my friends aren't really helpful with that problem either and the field of dietetics is somewhat interesting, but the apprenticeship is more for people who have less life experience. Also there are a lot of women in my course and I get constantly reminded that I am a man in a woman's job ( fucking flat heads ). 

So here I stand: I'm not really auto aggressive anymore, I stopped looking for the reason I have so little success in life in myself, but still don't really know what I want in regards to my identity. Can't apply for state support anymore, so studying is out of question, am 24, growing bald, have little moments of joy and insomnia without medication. 

Many TS I met are kinda sexist, so I'm still not sure wether I just want to match a picture but this time the female and not the male one or if this really makes me happy. I'm too much of a coward to try going out as cross dresser first. Besides people will see me as a cross dresser and not as my intended gender. Money would make this far easier, because I would be able to afford a taxi/ own car, clothes and make-up. No idea how to get that though. Not sure either what I wanted to tell you with this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe you got some ideas for a good paying job I can apply to or learn with a fucked up cv like mine. I thought about programming as you can teach it to yourself with little financial effort in about a year, but I find it rather dull and boring.

Someone asked me about what's my involvement with the trans community: 

&gt; My local spaces, the co-op, fundraising, legal advocacy about the bathroom bullshit, going to DC, trying to educate the rest of my family so they won't be mean to my parents....

I'm definitely not a radical feminist because 'men' and 'women' are dangerous and oppressive social constructs.

Gender identities are bullshit. Gender is nothing other than a dangerous and oppressive social construct. I make it a point to remember that ignorance is not malice and that the most critical thing if we all want to survive is loving and respectful communication and collaboration. Therefore, I do not want to lash out at people who use the word 'trans' to refer to themselves. So I'm not a trans exclusionist either.

I have suffered immense trauma as a result of gender, just like trans people. The way in which many in the trans community have emphasized gendered pronouns and pushed me to use gendered pronouns to refer to them:

* makes me uncomfortable because I'm ethically opposed to gender,
* has increased divisiveness in our world, 
* has provided fuel for the violent backlash against the left,
* and has contributed to the election of Donald Trump.

In some ways, I can see a silver lining in the presidency of Donald Trump. The immensity of suffering caused during this presidency has helped to show the horror that is the existence of the state to a much larger audience. However, me and my loved ones are among those who have personally experienced immense suffering under the Trump presidency. 

I am Autistic and I can often be quite blunt in my communication efforts. Because I am not skilled at the use of language in the majority of situations, people often interpret my words as rude and disrespectful. This has led to a number of people who refer to themselves as 'trans' thinking that I hate them.

I am drinking spearmint tea, taking calcium, magnesium, zinc and vitamin D as I have read studies that claim that taking these greatly reduce symptoms. I haven't noticed any difference thus far. My gyno has said electrolysis is a waste of money because the hormonal issues must be treated first. I am wondering what you ladies do while you are transitioning to get rid of the body hair?

535,2019-01-22 03:39:50,aiiqf3,2,1,"I had been chatting with a trans-woman from my home city (where I don't live) through a social network, a very talented artist and activist I very much admire. I was visiting and invited her to go out since I truly wanted to know more about her. 

She invited me to her apartment to drink a glass of wine, with the expectations some friends might join later. Nobody ended up coming.

We had a great conversation, where, throughout, she casually indicated that she was lately pursuing relationships with other queer/trans women. She also noted that she wished she would be able to flow more in that moment as she was feeling my flirty attitude. It wasn't tense at all, I wasn't expecting anything to happen that night beyond meeting a cool local artist.

But wine flowed, and at one point she sat in the sofa and said something that I understood as 'I just want that person to sit here with me and make out.' I approached, sat, and leaned in to kiss. Big no no. She was taken a back and demanded to know why I did that if she had not clearly indicated clearly that she wanted me to do so. She is right of course, I didn't read the situation right and looking back saw the trail of comments that, had I been more observant, would have told me to stay clear (I have been abroad for 10+ years, and we were communicating in our mother language). I also think that her comment in the sofa was in relation to a specific person she mentioned earlier in the night versus any person. I misunderstood ""That \[person\]"".

I tried to apologize and she told me she would not feel sorry for me. We left her place and we parted ways. 

Appreciate any advice on how to approach the situation, but do want to be able to communicate my apology with the hopes of keeping communication open. Our home country has been experiencing high levels of violence against women - particularly trans women - so I want to be extra careful as I imagine that this could've been seen as a serious breach of trust after she invited me to come drink wine.

Thank you all.

She has bright pink hair, loves to dress up, is OBSESSED with unicorns, she is the sweetest kid anyone could ever meet! I adore her (and her siblings, let’s not forget about them!). 

Last night my husband and I were discussing our concerns for her future. Right now she goes to school in a small town and everyone there knows and loves her. Here are some of our questions and worries:


1) What will happen in a few years when all the other girls go through puberty? How can we support her through that time? 

2) When is the appropriate age/time to begin hormone blockers or HRT? And what should we expect once that begins? 

3) Would it be appropriate to set her up with a therapist and if so, is it to early to start that now? (We want her to have as much support as possible)

4) What about dating!? I know she’s quite a ways off from this, but we all know how cruel kids can be! She hasn’t shown any interest in either sex as of yet (while my son, who’s only a year younger, has already had “girlfriends”). What is the best way to support her through that time? 

Currently, we pretty much let her direct us. She tells us what she likes and wants and how she feels and we encourage her to just be herself. But right now she’s so young, so it’s all pretty easy. 

What are some good resources for us as her parents? Are there any books we should read? 

I want all the best things for all 5 of our children, as any parent would. What can we do to help guide and support her and be the best parents we can be?

People who could have been like me that are younger have their own experiences. I cannot yet believe that I truly am a woman, though I have felt it every day of my life. Depending on the family, there are children now who are embraced as soon as they can express themselves.

It's beautiful, yet alien to me. Ten years ago the support groups I attended in a liberal bastion in the Midwest were all tears. Strangers in safe spaces would treat me as a rare bird. ""I don't know what to make of you,"" was a common refrain. 

Now the groups are love and laughter. Nobody has to apologize for coming out. We have terms for our foes and their tactics, and allies no longer fear for their own lives simply because they expressed our right to exist. For the first time I can *talk* to therapists and doctors and stylists without having to spend 20 minutes of my paid time giving them a tutorial in basic rights.

I love this new world, but the leader of my country is not of this new world. I can't turn off the news because it affects everyone I love, but without that surface level of jerks using us as a scapegoat to rile up the stupids life would be more than tolerable for us.

The dysphoria is monstrous, but now that I've embraced myself it's my Navi, my annoying little guiding light telling me where I need to go to advance the plot of my life. The truly wretched parts of my life aren't mine now, it's the fear of dumb hicks who listen to the radio drunk and horngry rather than getting therapy. 

The parts of my world that I have control over are fine and getting finer, but we cannot tolerate these institutions that perpetuate hate for a buck any longer.

I was hoping I could get some help on gender inclusive language for a women's professional group. Basically at my workplace we have a group to promote women in the workplace. It's open to all genders and even some men join, but our mission statement just says women since we are only focusing on women's issues. Some are concerned that if we expand on that it will lose sight on the fact that it's about women's issues so I need to craft some language that makes it really simple. There is a pride group that is equal to the women's grout that is actually made for promoting queer and gender folks on the workplace, so this group is specifically for folks identifying as women. Otherwise I would just say something like ""women and gender non-conforming individuals."" But GNC doesn't mean woman identified so that's more like erasing their whole imagine. 

The sentence in essentially: ""To create opportunities for women to thrive"" 

So I graduated college fairly recently and in college we used ""womxn."" Is that still a thing?

Or should we say ""To create opportunities for women (cisgender and trans women) to thrive"" 

Or should we say something else? 


Clearly I'm just talking myself in circles here. I tried Google and it got me no where helpful. Any help appreciated here! Also, it's worth noting we don't actually have any one in the office who is openly transgendered. This language is more to set the mindset for cis-women. 

Thank you!

642,2019-01-25 22:44:42,ajuovi,2,1,"So I was reading through a Reddit comment thread the other day and saw one of those all too common, ""being trans is a mental illness!"" Comments. Now I should mention at this point that I actually have a mental illness, (Pure O OCD) 
Contrary to what many people think, OCD can be a miserable condition, and also manifests itself in many unpleasant ways, outside what is often portrayed in media.
So where am I headed here? Well when I read this comment about trans people being mentally ill I had the thought, ""so what?"" It really shouldn't matter if being trans is a form of mental illness or not, in general I believe people don't have a firm enough understanding of mental illness in mainstream culture. It's often seen as being a bad thing, only criminals and creeps are mentally ill. 
The reality is that having a mental illness shouldn't be seen as being indicative of having a bad nature, and if being trans is a mental illness then y'all have something I don't, and that's a cure! Many mental illnesses, including pure O, don't have cures, you just have to deal with it, therapy, anxiety/depression meds, etc. and you just hope that as you get older your symptoms might fade. If I could have a surgery, and take some hormones to make my pure O go away, that would be great!
I guess what I'm trying to get at is that, ""Being Trans is a mental illness"" is something that trans phobes have latched onto as an argument for why trans people are bad, when the truth is that it's a non issue, something being a mental illness doesn't necessarily make it evil, nor does it mean that the person afflicted with said mental illness is a bad person, it just means that there is something different in how their brain works.

But i usually did it for purely sexual reasons; not necessarily to be a woman, but I got off on the fact that I looked hot in girls clothes. I loved the way I looked as a girl sexually and wanted others to see me as a sex object, but I would rarely go in public. As a teenager, I dated girls and enjoyed having sex with them for the most part. I love the female body and really enjoyed having female sex partners, which is confusing because I really want to be the girl when I'm having sex, but I still would pursue females because I wasn't sexually attracted to men physically, just mentally in my fantasies. I would always fantasize about a man having sex with me as a woman, or a woman having sex with me as a woman. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess what I'm getting at is, my trans feelings are tied up in my sexuality and not necessarily in my wanting to live my life as a woman. I'm worried that I'm only having these feelings because I want to experience sex as woman, not because I want to live a life as a woman.

To summarize, I live life as a man and have sex with a woman most of the time, but I fantasize sexually about being a girl and having sex as a girl. I have gone through crossdressing periods where I have gone out as a woman and really enjoyed it, but purely from a sexual point of view. I liked thinking that other people were viewing me as a sex object and a woman. I go through phases in my life where I really embracing the crossdressing and buy beautiful clothes, and then I feel shame and throw them all away. I've done this for 25 years on and off and i'm now in a crossdressing phase and I want to just embrace it fully, but I'm worried that maybe I'm only doing it to get off, not to actually be a woman for real. All day I dream about having breasts and a pretty face, but is that just so I can feel sexy or do I really want to be a woman? Also, I have a wife who knows about my crossdressing but is totally opposed to any of it including even roleplaying in the bedroom. She is not supportive at all and actively discourages any of my crossdressing sexual urges in bed so I have to hide everything from her which makes me feel more shame and guilt.

719,2019-01-30 05:58:57,al9pcw,7,1,"Hello everyone! I'm wondering what I can do/if there's anything I can do to help my 16yo cousin. I'll call him S.

Me and S have always been close despite only seeing each other at big family parties. About a year ago he said he needed to talk to me and told me he was a boy. S asked me to refer to him as female in front of the family till he figured out what to do. We talked about it for a while and he said he wasn't sure if telling his parents was a good idea and in light of more recent events I see why. 

He ended up telling them shortly after and they were super unhappy with him. They dead name him, rag on him, go out of their way to mention their 'daughter', etc. It really hurts him. He told them he was having major mental health issues and they told him that he was also making that up. His girlfriend of 3ish years also broke up with him and trash talks him at school. 

All of this is especially infuriating because S's father's brother killed himself because of mental illness a few years ago. So you'd think S's parents might take that a little more seriously. 

Christmas was hard for him I think. We have a very large family and everyone found out, not by S's choice. His parents were doing the whole 'our lovely daughter' bit. A lot of people were using the wrong pronouns and shit. Our elderly grandpa said something along the lines of 'hes obviously better as a boy than a girl', one of our aunts agreed and after that people sort of dropped it until after dinner. I made sure to use his name and he him pronouns and I corrected his sister once and she was like yeah whatever.

I texted him after and was basically like rough night huh? I text him every other week or so to check in and a lot of the times he just says yep parents still suck, yup still depressed. I encouraged him to maybe seek counseling through school since his parents are being so weird about that but hes too depressed or afraid. I understand that feeling. I told him I started counseling and it really helped me but I don't wanna push too hard because another point of stress seems like the last thing he needs. 

I'm at a loss of what to do and I'm very worried about him. Any ideas would be so appreciated.

Love is something I can understand - whether heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual or the many other flavours of love. Love is simple, love is complex, love is many things to many people; but whether or not one agrees with anything other than heterosexual love, love is still love. We feel it we can relate to this.

What I don't understand, and probably never truly can understand unless one experiences this, is the feeling of being something I'm not. I cannot understand the feeling of not being a man. I was born Male, I grew up like this, it's all I know.

By saying I don't understand doesn't meant I don't want to understand. I do accept people as I find them. I have dealt with trans people in the past and accepted them. But I've never understood it.

So, please help me understand you.

749,2019-01-31 10:51:33,alobpb,5,1,"So, as a kid (age 6-10) I vividly remember telling my parents every now and then I wanted to be a girl. I dressed up in dresses all the time at home, my friends were all girls and I was into all the girly stuff and hated the boyish stuff (we're talking about the 90's here so those things were pretty much playing with dolls as opposed to soccer. Still hate the latter by the way!). As I remember it, I basically was a girl except for exterior appearances. My parents never thought much of it but still were sweet enough to allow me to dress up like a girl every now and then at home. But surely, puberty hit me in the face and suddenly my attention shifted to totally different things, like trying as hard as possible to be normal. The thoughts of being a girl almost completely faded away and didn't bother me for a long time after that. The only thing I tried every so often was wining a towel around my head and blurrily looking into the mirror to see how long/female hair would suite me. Silly me.  

Until recent years, that is. Every now and then the thought would come up, not thinking much of it. However, in more recent times the thought has been coming up more and more, and I cannot so easily discard it anymore. I even had a conversation about it with my boyfriend, which of course was quite emotional for both of us. The ""conclusion"" from that conversation was that I'm simply not sure enough to do anything with it.

But that answer might simply have been an answer out of fear; it's such a big step, maybe the biggest one one can take in a human lifetime. I've got the utmost respect for people who took the leap, I truly look up to you.

Though I was still horribly depressed, I felt such a relief that I could finally be ‘me’, something I’d never felt before. I’ve been through sixth form and my new college as a Male and I’ve felt no doubt or problems (apart from obviously dysphoria and passing). 

Now, I recently received a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and a T prescription through gender care. I was due to get the shot a couple of weeks ago.

When I met her I suddenly felt a gut feeling like it was the wrong thing to go and I think she was feeling that too. It was almost as if I just wanted to run away and scream “NO STOP!” . But , instead , ignoring those feelings I went to the nurses office to get my first shot of T. I had to wait an awfully long time as they’d forgotten to sign me in , so I ended up seeing the nurse 2 hours later than I should’ve and spent that time feeling anxious in the waiting room. Throughout that whole day I swung from being so excited and happy , to so nervous and sad. Eventually I entered into the nurses office and she asked me if I was excited then out of the blue I just burst into tears and I said to her I’m so scared and I keep thinking is this really the right thing for me ? She told me she’s not going to do the injection today as I showed some hesitation and told me to come back when I’m ready - fair enough, I thought.

7,2019-01-21 18:05:09,aicru1,1,1,"hey there! i have a ton of questions that i don’t really feel comfortable asking the only openly non-binary person in my life (just for privacy’s sake), so sorry if this is long. 

for maybe the last five years, i’ve been a little confused about my gender. when i was younger i thought a lot about myself in a male body and kind of fantasized about it, but i didn’t really have any dysphoria or urge to be male. with time though i became very uncomfortable in my own body because i gained a bit of weight in my hips and butt, and i was distraught because essentially, my clothes didn’t hang off my body like they did when i had a more masculine one. freshman year of highschool my brother gave me a bunch of his old clothes and i finally started to thrive, realizing i liked them way more than i liked my more revealing or more femme clothes. 

within the last year, i’ve thought a lot about using they/them pronouns. however, i don’t know if its appropriate for me? i’ve heard mixed things about of non-binary folk have to have had dysphoria or not, and i’m not sure if anything i’ve experiences is dysphoria.

my community isn’t a place where i can learn about this stuff. would it be appropriate for me to refer to myself as non-binary? what kind of terms do i need to get used to in referring to myself and other non-binary folk? any advice?

    My (23-F) sibling (Q-20, formerly M-20) wants to go by xe/xim/xer pro-nouns. My sibling is living with my parents and our younger brother (14) while I have a separate apartment. Nobody is handling this well. I've just been ignoring it. Our brother is a really sweet kid who cares about everyone in the family, but basically doesn't believe gender fluidity is a thing or that gender-queer/nonbinary/trans people are real. He's also a big gamer/youtube fan and they make fun of nonbinary people on the channels he follows. Mom has also started making fun of nonbinary people, and Dad thinks that trans people who get surgery have been tricked by the big pharma into mutilating themselves and insists on calling my sibling 'he'. They all think xe's crazy, going through a phase, or is having an existential crisis and is just confused about everything. Some of our extended family members have reacted even worse (xe's been brainwashed by the global/liberal elites and should be in a mental institution :/). 
    
    I care about my sibling a lot want to be supportive but even I'm having trouble accepting xer identity, because my sibling also a habit of making dramatic life decisions and abandoning them as soon as they get difficult or boring. ""I'm gonna move to New York to be an artist"" was abandoned after two months, ""I'm gonna go to college full time"" was abandoned after one semester, ""I'm going to stay at this job for a couple years because they pay well, promote from within, and are willing to pay for me to go to college part time"" was abandoned after three months, ""I'm going to start my own business"" was abandoned almost immediately. So how do I know this is legit and not just a phase like all that other stuff? It matters because this is going to cause a lot of conflict in our family. I'm going to have to put myself out there and risk relationships with them which would suck if xe's just going to go back to being a dude in three months. 
    
    My sibling as a history of getting swept up in random crap without thinking it through. Xe fell for a online scam earlier this year trying to find an apartment and lost $1200. Xe's now trying to find a new place to live for free by writing notes in marker and leaving them in random people's mailboxes. My sibling believes the most ridiculous lies (like xe's ex-boyfriend telling xim that he killed a guy by running him over with a horse). Xe's gotten into ridiculous health fads, pseudo-science, conspiracy theories like anti-vaxxing and (((global elites))) all sorts if new age pseudo-spiritual nonsense. ""We'll manifest money with the power of positive thinking/trust the universe"" sort of thing. I'm not saying that being gender queer is a conspiracy theory or a scam just pointing out a pattern my sibling has a pattern of being flaky and out of touch with reality. 
    
    I've talked about it with my sibling after xe asked to use the gender neutral pro-nouns and xe said some things I've heard others express like feeling dysphoria, feeling wrong for being a ""broken pro-creator"", feeling disconnected from reality because xe feel disconnected from xes body. But those kernels of clarity were wrapped with a whole lot of 'sex is the union between the physical and the spiritual' and more new-agey mysticism. I'm having a lot of trouble taking xer seriously and can't imagine how we're going to convince my parents and relatives to take this seriously.
    
    Do you have any insight on what's going on in my sibling's head and suggestions for how I should treat xim? Or suggestions for how to discuss this with our family members? Is there a way to discuss my sibling's mistakes and personality flaws without making it about xer being gender-queer? Am I being to harsh? A lot of people fall for scams and most 20 year olds don't have their lives figured out. I can only imagine how much worse this would be if you also had gender dysphoria and everybody though you were crazy, even your family. I'm a very rational scientific person and my sibling is more artistic and emotional, could some of my judgment be due to differences in communication styles? My sibling definitely has problems with depression and I've noticed a lot of the symptoms lately (Losing weight, trouble making decisions, inappropriate affect). I don't want to make that worse.

First time poster. Starting with a bit of an awkward question. 

I'm an AMAB individual who's recently come to terms with the fact that I'm non-binary, which is something I've suspected for some time. I've presented as masculine for my whole life, and only recently have I started dressing feminine when at home (leggings are AMAZING). I'm still unsure if and when I'll be ready to present myself in a more androgynous/femme manner outside of my apartment, but for the time being, starting to explore my gender on my own terms feels so good.

Anyway, I've been trying to find underwear that is either gender-neutral or feminine yet accommodating for the obvious differences with a biologically male body.

________
I've had a friend for a long time, and value her friendship. But thanks to being bi (I suspect), I have passing thoughts of being more than friends with just about everyone (including her) because most of the qualities I like in my friends, I also like in my partners (go figure). It's a running joke -- ""We can't be friends with anyone.. .there are no friends, there is only prey. We are... the bilociraptors. Screeeeee!"" 


Being trans/GQ though adds an extra dimension to it, and along with it the crippling self-doubt and low self-esteem. What do I really have to offer anyone? Could anyone love me?

I don't feel strongly sexually attracted to pretty much everyone, or that might point me in a direction. Plot twist: My friend is also bi and GQ, but unlike me has no interest in transitioning, etc. (she is AFAB, I am AMAB). 


I'm just wondering how other people sort through all this, because most of the queer community still has some scripts to go off of, and their communities and social expectations are clearer. Being *gender* queer though adds an extra dimension to sexuality that has always been ill-defined and confusing to me. Specifically, that there's no sharp delineation between them. Gender identity is interwoven into sexuality, and when both are fluid, it makes separating romantic interest from friendship a lot harder.

- Wearing heels after leg day is a very bad idea
- Women live longer than men unless you count the difference in time spent in the bathroom; I did the math. I didn't include time spent waiting in line. 
- Jeans for men are comfy even when meant to be snug.
- Jeans for women have been known to cause temporary paralysis. 
- Women really do have a better sense of smell. It has to be hormones because F2Ms douse themselves with Axe too and are oblivious.
- Men say ""oops!"" and women say ""oop!"" ... and I don't know why this difference exists.
- It can break someone's brain when they can't work out someone's gender. Like, CTRL+ALT+DEL... some people just freeze up.
- Youtube is full of lies. It's always harder than it looks. *Always*.
- Almost nobody thinks they're sexist. 
- Almost everyone thinks they're accepting/tolerant.
- Everyone is wrong about the last two. 
- I broke down for no apparent reason in the cat food aisle awhile back. None of my (female) friends thought this was in any way unusual or noteworthy. As a guy, this would have been a cause for great concern -- now it's Tuesday. I'm the same person. 
- As a guy, when I went to the doctor and said I was in pain, they ordered tests, asked lots of questions, and referred me to numerous experts.
- As a woman, I'm pretty much on my own unless I have a sucking chest wound and am literally spewing blood all over their shoes. 
- Men's sizing is quantifiable and objective. Women's sizing is a fractal shit show.
- Example -- Men: Boxers or briefs. 
- Women: **∫**₀^t∆ pvₑ / m₀-(pt)d∆ = vₑln(m₀-mբ))+vₑln(m₀ - 0)
- Men resolve conflict a lot better than women do. Two men can get into a fight, a few punches are exchanged, and they'll head off and have beers after like nothing happened. Two women get in a fight and it's fucking WW3 with both of them shitting in the other's souls. 
- I never used to apologize for getting into the elevator, but now I do. I don't know why. 
- In 2010, everyone was talking about gay rights. In 2015, everyone talked about which bathroom to use. In 2019, it's which pronouns to use. I expect that by 2025 we'll use pronouns in public about as often as 'fuck', marriage will be something only people ""who live in the sticks"" do, and I'm not sure how I feel about any of it.
- But everybody wants my opinion about these things... like I'm the ambassador of 'Genderica'.
- Guys seem happiest in jeans and a t-shirt. Women seem happiest with PJs and liquor. 
- There is nothing quite as terrifying or awe-inspiring as a drag queen going full tilt.

70,2019-01-15 21:47:05,agdr7s,0,1,"Please forgive me if this is out of line. I fully expect downvotes and anger, but I need to get this off my chest. I humbly ask for your compassion and for the permission to keep this rant up.

A while ago, I decided to trawl lgbt related tags on twitter, and came across a salty post along the lines of ""if you call yourself genderqueer but look like your assigned gender, you're just a spicy cis"". And usually stuff like that doesn't bother me, because I know I shouldn't waste my emotion on dumb internet things, but... this time it did, and it's been hanging on my back since then.

Ever since I started to take my search for gender-related closure more seriously, it's made me feel progressively more alienated as a person. Binary trans people are already a niche minority group compared to the rest of society. The further you stray from that, the more radicalized the population becomes. And I've noticed, the less it becomes about gender itself and the more it becomes about a subcultural identity. The more I think about it, the more I realize that although what I encountered in that twitter post in particular was blatant, the attitude itself not an isolated thing.

It's incredibly depressing to know that not only does society at large view my personal struggles as either nonexistant (if I don't reveal my struggles) or attention seeking behavior (if I were to), but also that even within the group of people who populate the LGBT community, my struggles don't count because I'm not visibly queer. I get the feeling I'm significantly older than most of the people who frequent various nonbinary-spectrum communities. Coming out, much less visibly presenting, is not an option for me, and it will never be. I grew up in a conservative religious household and my relationship with my family is a strained and complex one. I get the impression that not a lot of people in these communities understand the reality of what it's like to have that kind of family.

I fully expect downvotes and anger, but I need to get this off my chest. I humbly ask for your compassion and for the permission to keep this rant up.\n\nA while ago, I decided to trawl lgbt related tags on twitter, and came across a salty post along the lines of ""if you call yourself genderqueer but look like your assigned gender, you\'re just a spicy cis"". And usually stuff like that doesn\'t bother me, because I know I shouldn\'t waste my emotion on dumb internet things, but... this time it did, and it\'s been hanging on my back since then.\n\nEver since I started to take my search for gender-related closure more seriously, it\'s made me feel progressively more alienated as a person. Binary trans people are already a niche minority group compared to the rest of society. The further you stray from that, the more radicalized the population becomes. And I\'ve noticed, the less it becomes about gender itself and the more it becomes about a subcultural identity. The more I think about it, the more I realize that although what I encountered in that twitter post in particular was blatant, the attitude itself not an isolated thing.\n\nIt\'s incredibly depressing to know that not only does society at large view my personal struggles as either nonexistant (if I don\'t reveal my struggles) or attention seeking behavior (if I were to), but also that even within the group of people who populate the LGBT community, my struggles don\'t count because I\'m not visibly queer. I get the feeling I\'m significantly older than most of the people who frequent various nonbinary-spectrum communities. Coming out, much less visibly presenting, is not an option for me, and it will never be. I grew up in a conservative religious household and my relationship with my family is a strained and complex one. I get the impression that not a lot of people in these communities understand the reality of what it\'s like to have that kind of family. I cannot afford to publicly express my gender in the way that helps me alleviate dysphoria, and I can even less afford to give myself a hip, queer makeover to fit in.

80,2019-01-18 07:54:00,ah884v,2,1,"So since the middle of last year, I have been very confused as to what my actual gender is. I am 23 and AMAB.

To give some story, it started when one of my BFFs told me that most of my mannerisms (the way I acted around them) was mostly feminine. At that point, I was both shocked and (I guess) happy at the same time that my friends perceived me as that. Since then, I first bought colored nail polish as to enjoy wearing nail polish and breaking the stigma that ""guys should not wear nail polish unless it's clear. I bought it both for the appeal and because I had a bad habit of chewing on my nails, so this helped out a lot. Once I got comfortable with wearing nail polish, I soon started buying more colors to try wearing (mostly different shades of blue and white).

Few months later, next thing I know my mind gravitates buying mostly feminine outfits than masculine outfits, mostly because I could never find anything appealing to me that just says ""Wow, this would look pretty on me"". So about August/September of 2018 is when I started buying more feminine outfits. I was still buying masculine outfits for everyday wear, just not as much. Today every time I go clothes shopping, I mostly just go towards the ladies section and shop there first before the mens section.

Back in early November 2018, I went to an Ulta Beauty store and asked one of the hair dressers in the Salon area about possibly giving me a pixie style haircut. After looking at some pictures on Pinterest and seeing the many styles and how interesting they looked, I really wanted to see how well a hair style like those would work on me. They told me that my hair would need to be long enough in order to get the results that I want. Last I spoke to them was 3 weeks ago. So hopefully next week I'll be able to go back in there and ""maybe"" get my hair cut the way I'd like to go for.

Since November of 2018, I have also shaved my legs, chest and arm hair because I feel as though body hair just gets in the way and especially with my body, most of my chest hair was really ""belly"" hair and to me just looking disgusting if you are trying to impress other people. And just in general, I really hated it. While shaving my belly hair, I figured I'd shave my upper chest hair and then shave my legs and arm hair. Shaving my legs (to me) was a blessing because now my legs feel smoother than ever, even if I have to shave them again every once in a while (same goes for the rest). I also shave my face every other day because someone who's feminine does not/should not have facial hair (plus I've just never really liked it).

Last month I bought makeup (lipstick, lip liner, foundation, primer, a facial brush, sponge, mirror, and removal wipes) and a makeup bag to put it all of my makeup and nail polish in. I've also considered moving my feminine clothes out from a box just strictly for them into the rest of my masculine wardrobe so that I can wear some masculine things one day and possibly a feminine outfit the next or vice versa.

I've also consider about possibly going on HRT and transition myself to look more feminine.

I have not yet ""come out"" to my parents, whom I would like for them to be the first ones to hear about it before I really confirm anything else to anyone, whether it be friends, other family members, etc.  


So in short, out of what I have said here, I'd just like to know if my ""assigned gender"" has changed every since I've considered myself a cisgender male. I'd like to believe that I could be either androgynous or a Transfeminine, but I'd like to get some feedback/ideas/input from y'all as to what y'all think my real gender could be. Yes, I do understand that finding out my real gender is something that should be explored by myself, but I have done some research and I figure if I post something like this here, that I could possibly get some answers/advice.

I'm 23 and AFAB. I've been shedding a lot of internalized heteronormativity these past few years, and in doing so there's been a lot of closeted/buried feelings and issues that have come to light in full force since I've paid more attention to my inner voice(vs the internalized voices from my parents and the rest of the world), if any of that makes sense?

One of the biggest issues was how much I hated my large chest as a kid, and looking at myself in the mirror causes a lot of grief. I developed really early in elementary school and along with being an asexual who was sexualized at a young age, there's just a lot of mess there... A lot of distain for my body. I remember girls wanting to stuff their bras with tissues and all I wanted to do was wrap Saran wrap around my chest. All the shitty comments from my narc mother about my large chest, boys poking and grabbing and laughing, girls saying they wish they had what I have, saying I should be grateful for what I was born with, etc etc... I feel disgusted with my own body and my hatred wants me to chop them off completely. But I still have days where I really like seeing my feminine body in the mirror, I like how I look in some dresses and feeling feminine is just as much a part of me as wanting to chop my boobs off with a guillotine.

Any case, I'm taking a shot and trying binding for the first time to see if that helps minimize the sickness I feel towards my body on days where I'm not comfortable seeing a female figure. My problem is, I'm worried about the largeness of my chest, if binding doesn't work the way I want it to(large boobs being binded still show enough boob to look feminine vs masculine) and if it will harm any tissues at all by binding(last time I measured my size I was 36GG and I'm worried about the large size). Would it be worth it to actually get a substantial reduction instead of binding first? I'm an incredibly sweaty person and also wondering if using Gold Bond while binding would help with any discomfort there.

88,2019-01-19 04:01:55,ahimoi,7,1,"Hey yall
sorry for the whining and the throwaway account but I've been in a not so good place recently.
Just a lot of venting

Like the title says, I genuinely hate being nonbinary and all the assumptions that come with it.

My identity is not a political statement.

I'm not proud of my indentity (though I support people who are) and have no desire to ""shove it in people's faces"" as the transphobes like to say. I just don't have the luxury of being stealth, and therefore, will ALWAYS have to choose between severe dysphoria or being out.

I have atypical and likely incurable dysphoria. It can probably be lessened, but not eliminated. It's my burden to carry for my whole life. I have a right to bitch about it.

I don't demand special treatment like cis people seem to think. I just want equal treatment, and I'm not even provided with that.

Terfs seem to have this idea that all afab transpeople are trans because ""the patriacrchy!!!"" and ""misogyny!!!"" but I have an atypical experience here too. I don't suffer from internalized misogyny (mostly because I'm not a woman, but yknow), but I've also somehow never been a victim of misogyny or any type of oppression, discrimination, or harrassment because of my AGAB. Given that I've somehow avoided those factors, why would they be my motive to transition?

A lot of cis people seem to believe that my identity is based solely on stereotypes. It has nothing to do with that at all. I've always been a little more masc leaning. Why couldn't I just be a gender nonconforming girl? Because Im not a girl. God I wish I could be a girl, I really do, but I'm not. 

A lot of binary trans people are under the impression I'm a ""transtrender"" because ""nonbinary people don't have dysphoria and just claim to be trans to fit in""

I have severe social dysphoria

bottom dysphoria

chest dysphoria

voice dysphoria

height dysphoria

I had dysphoria even before puberty.

I came out for the first time around age 6 or 7. Then again around 12. Then 15. Then 18. I was always ignored because ""what if it's a phase?"". No one pressured me to be trans. I desperately wish I could be a cis girl, or at least a trans man so maybe I could have curable dysphoria.

I don't give a damn about challenging gender or enforcing/not enforcing stereotypes.
That's not it at all.

I'm not ""confused"" I'm just agender.

I want to be stealth so bad but it can never happen if I want to be happy.

I just want to be treated like an actual person and understood.
I want to stop being accused of ""faking"".

There's alot so thanks for barring with me.


About 10 months ago I started causally seeing a nonbinary person (female at birth, I apologise if that's not the correct way to say that). since then our ""causal"" relationship has evolved into some much more serious and we are now thinking about dating. I really think I found someone special here.


This is where things get abit more complicated. untill now I have only been interested in woman and I have alot of mixed feelings. My partner experiences chest disphoria and has expressed to me that they would be interested in having surgery. I am worried that this might change how I feel about them. As a streight male I am attracted to breasts and a more female image. 

I fear it will become more difficult if they look less female to blend into my traditional place in society with them as my partner witch raises a whole host of stuggles/questions. Many of witch nonbinary people experience regularly and by dating this person I also adopt some of.This all makes me question if I actually like them for who they are or if I'm just lying to myself.Even though Its fairly straight forward for me to call my partner by the correct pronouns and respect there gender identity this whole thing will become more real after they take steps to transform there body.


Also my mother past away from Breast cancer a few years ago. She had surgery and i witnessed her struggle with the opposite kind of disphoria after that. I am worried that seeing my partners chest in the future might be a traumatic reminder of my past. *Deffinetly a mood killer during sex.


I really care about them and want to be with them but I also don't want to enter into a relationship that maybe I will think differently about in the future. I feel really horrible that this is even a question for me. If you love someone you love them but there are always compromises.

91,2019-01-19 16:39:20,ahnlo6,14,1,"Hi there. I was wondering if anyone else here experiences this sort of thing. To give you some context, I'm 27, afab and don't have a clear sense of gender.

So, to begin with: I've always had difficulty recognizing and expressing emotions, which I initially attributed to my parents being dysfunctional when I was a child, but lately came to think might be just a part of my personality (INTJ type). When I was in primary school, I started developing something like an alternative world in my head, with different people, different places, etc. A realistic world, no dragons or stuff like that.

I would ""go"" there mentally when I was bored, mostly, and just imagine different situations. It's always been with me, even if there were long stretches of time when I didn't do that. There is one central character who's always been there even when other characters changed. He has a name and a distinct personality, very similar to my own. 

A few years ago I realized that at times I invest more emotional energy in that other world than in my real life. Initially it made me sad and feeling like I'm crazy, but then I realized that having this parallel world in my head helps me to recognize my emotions in real life better. Because oftentimes I imagine situations that I wish could happen in real life (and in this way I find out what I would like to happen) or I imagine situations that are pretty similar to what is actually happening, just with different people involved (and this helps me realize how I'm feeling about a given situation).

I told my therapist, who I've been seeing for ~5 years now, about it and she didn't think I was crazy, I think she even said it's good that I have a way of figuring out my emotions. What I didn't tell her, was the part about the central character being consistently male throughout the years. And I'm beginning to wonder what this means for me. Lately I've been thinking that it's my way of ""living"" my life as a male person, and that maybe I somehow need this to connect to my feelings and make sense of them. It feels strange to be thinking this but also surprisingly natural.

I would say that the way we label gender just doesn't work with me--I don't feel female or male or anything.

To put it simply, I am and am not a girl in the same way that I am and am not a boy.

All this is to say, does liking men make me straight? I've sent a long time debating my sexual orientation. I felt I was bi for a while but ultimately it didn't feel right. I accepted that I like men, but I resented the term ""straight"". The image conjured up by ""straight girl"" didn't feel like me, it strikes me as very cisnormative.

123,2019-01-25 06:02:32,ajm49x,8,1,"So it's late. I just laid down to sleep after comforting a sick friend/roommate with a cuddle and a temple massage. And it struck me that as an AMAB, this would be contextualized differently than if I'd been born female. And I got to thinking about a lot of things that for me is just friendship that others would see as something else.


As a guy, this would be something reserved for a romantic interest. A lot of affectionate displays and comforting others would be. Even something like hugging is viewed that way. Like my nephew. He's 8 now and doesn't like goodbye hugs anymore. But my two nieces I couldn't leave without at least three. 


Being gender queer makes how I express affection and how it is perceived awkward at times. I'm never quite sure what the protocol is. People who are more accepting don't have as big of a problem with things like hugs or kisses on the head. But I've seen it cuts both ways. AFABs who prefer handshakes also seem uncomfortable when hugged at times. It's a barrier whichever side of queer someone is on.


I try not to let it get to me. The other day I went to a Leann Chin and a girl there was new and for flustered. As a customer I asked if she wanted a hug. She almost burst into tears and said ""YES!"" and we hugged and gave our names. That's not something two guys would do. But it felt natural to me.


That's the thing about gender though. Sometimes it's hard to tell where identity ends and personality begins. Am I just a touchy feely person or is it because that's what's expected, or is it forced unconsciously. I don't have good answers. But to me, handshake or hug was
a bigger question than what bathroom to use. At work, guessing wrong could be seen as sexual harassment. But doing neither comes off as aloof or cold. 


It also struck me how we interact with friends can be so
different. Two girls can kiss goodbye and nobody thinks twice. Or netflix and curling up on each other. Two guys and they have to be gay. Or sit on opposite sides of the couch. But what about non binary people? It might seem like they're picking a ""side"". And it's common to hear people comment like ""well, if he wants to be a guy, he shouldn't do that."" What if they're just more affectionate? What if it's a personal choice of personality instead of social identity? Shouldn't that be validated too? Does it have to mean more?


There's no guide on where the boundaries are. Often times it feels like I'm just blundering around in ambiguity.  Can I cuddle a sick friend? Should I offer? How would it come off? These are questions I ask often, things that for other people it would be obvious. And it can be jarring to do what feels natural to me but the other person gets awkward about.


But as awkward as it can sometimes be, choosing to be affectionate instead of safely remaining distant is a choice I'll keep making. I don't know if it makes me more of a woman, less of a man, or just is who I am. I just know that it's a colder, harder world to always pick the safe choice. To remain gender neutral in a world that does its best every day to make me choose a side is a hard fight. And sometimes I don't give a damn what side I'm on.

At that time I didn’t really feel “male”, but I also followed my own belief that I didn’t really need a label. Let everyone think what they want about my masculinity or femininity or whatever. 

Lately I’ve been thinking a lot. I’ve been changing my appearance a lot. I got a couple piercings on a whim, dyed my hair a month later. I’m growing out my hair.

Talking about indifference, apathy, pomogender etc. at length might be uncharted territory for a lot of communities. People talking about this are few and far between (considering the few people who do find it worth their time to talk about it). Some definitions of apathy describe it very similar to gender non-conformity but I think there are enough differences with the mindset and behavior to differentiate it.

I thought it would be helpful add my two cents to the understanding of indifference. I'm not be best case study; I'm in early stages of defining what I am and others may have drastically differing experiences later in their journey. Also my platonic behavior might be tied to asexual traits but I think there are enough differing traits to make a distinction.

I am not making the claim that indifferents are a suppressed individuals; based on my lifestyle, indifference is probably inconsequential with how I live my life and my place in society. Also, I'm not trying to claim that pronouns are unimportant; pronouns/roles are very important, they ascribe internal/external qualities, have a social function and they make English the convoluted lovable trashy language that it is.

With that out of the way, I hope you find that my perspective gives some more light on the topic. I would love to hear differing opinions and experiences regarding this (if you are willing).

Hi, I'm Jacob.

I'm 24 years old.

Not too long ago, I publicly told the void that  ""I'm indifferent to my gender"". What I wrote took me aback. I had to ask myself, am I actually questioning my gender or am I just at odds with how society expects archetypal male traits from me?

I'm born male. I look like a male, I walk and talk like a male and that's okay... I guess... I don't feel the urge to change my appearance to more butch or fem. I always lived comfortably in this body so I might as well keep it this way. I don't mind people deliberately misgendering me, in some scenarios it can be endearing. I look after kids a lot of the time so ""aunty"" or ""koka"" (Te Reo for aunty) is appropriate sometimes. If you wanna be endearing and call me gal, girlfriend, dude, guy, bro or sis, that's cool. If an ass tries to call me miss, maam mistress mrs, or lady, I'm not entirely phased. For my use, titles and pronouns have either a sentimental or utilitarian function. Apart from the descriptive use I don't demand titles cause they are meaningless to me; not for socio-political reasons, just that my birth-sex doesn't  play a part in how I interact or exchange in my community. I can fit comfortably and/or passively in a lot of groups; whether be a circle of aunties, a bunch of farming blokes, sisters getting together for a reality TV marathon, it hasn't much consequence, there is no lynch mob from me gardening or taking pottery instead of plumbing. 

Now this is where I talk about some of my asexual traits. I may not be giving a complete picture of what indifference is; but I should probably mention it.

I never really felt the desire to explore my sexuality with other people. Some people might brush me off as a virgin (that's okay, I'm fine with that) but when I picture desire or attraction with other, I can only see platonic romantic interactions with people. I have a drive, I have visual cues for attraction but it's not how I actually desire for relationships.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, what do I feel like? 

I am biologically and chemically male but being that is meaningless to me. My personality comes from something deeper in my soul, something that flows through all forms of my relationships.

Being genderfluid/gender non-conforming hasn't been something I've had time to deal with since I wrote that last post, but I'm back here now!

Who on here *enjoys* thrift stores, and do you think they're good for finding things that you wouldn't find elsewhere?

There's one I go to [here in England] and it's a good one - the staff are helpful and friendly even though I'm not sure if LGBT / genderqueer issues are something they're aware of.

I would link to it on Google Street View but would that be spamming, even though I'm not affiliated with them and it's just a recommendation?

A lot of the time I find nice more feminine-looking tops and shorts there for around £2 [ ($2.61 in USD at current exchange rates)  ] - a bargain given their RRP would be about £20-£30 when new!

157,2019-01-30 19:00:38,alg2qu,5,1,"I'm 21 and AFAB and I currently identify as a lesbian. I have been struggling with gender for what feels like my whole life. I'm not sure, however, if these are feelings are similar to/are gender dysphoria or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel fine calling myself a ""woman"" but I don't necessarily feel like only a woman or like the ""woman"" I am expected to be. Wearing skirts or dresses makes me want to crawl out of my skin. It makes me so uncomfortable, just thinking about it makes me feel physically disgusted. The last time I put on a dress was for my sister's wedding and before then, the last time was over 7 years ago. I also hate knowing/thinking about that I have a uterus, and sometimes I think I would prefer having a penis and I daydream about having a penis during sex. I don't hate having a vagina and labia  (it's really the uterus that disgusts me--I used to feel uncomfortable with a vagina), but some days I would prefer a penis. Pregnancy all around also disgusts me and even thinking about ever being pregnant makes my skin crawl. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently cut my hair extremely short (above my ears in a men's style) after having it down to my shoulder blades for years, and I got a men's suit. I have never felt that validated or sexy before in my life. I remember looking in the mirror after the hairstylist finished cutting my hair, and I was ecstatic. I now only wear men's business clothes and almost all of my casual clothes are masculine. 

&amp;#x200B;

I recently used they/them pronouns in a social setting, and it felt really nice. I also tried giving the option of either she/her/her's and they/them/theirs to people and that felt even better/more validating.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't feel any discomfort about my breasts---in fact, I love having them. They are pretty small and I have never tried binding, however. When I did have long hair, I did feel comfortable, but it didn't bring nearly as much joy as having my short hair + dressing masculine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Up until age 13, I hated being called a girl and being associated with anything ""girly."" But I also hated being called a boy. I thought I was non-binary when I was 18, but I was barely comfortable with my non-straight sexuality at that point so I was too scared to think too much about it. Every few months, these questions return to me and I pack it away out of fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I don't feel terrible about being seen as a woman, but I definitely feel different than what one would consider a ""typical"" cisgender woman. I'm not sure where I fall or if these are similar feelings other cisgender women have or if I'm more a butch cisgender lesbian. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've tried to sit down with myself and think it through/find an identity or something that might explain what I feel, but I think the fear of how people will react to me possibly being anything other than cisgender scares me.

Hey everyone! I'm a college theatre student currently doing my senior thesis capstone project. I recently just did A Midsummer Nights Dream by Shakespeare, and I played Oberon (King of the Fairies, normally played by an amab person) as an afab genderfluid person (they/them btw). Part of my project is about representation of genderfluid/non-binary/trans people in theatre and modern media. 

Unfortunately, there aren't too many sources about this topic that are longer than a small article. On top of that, I am not allowed to use my own experiences and perspective as a genderfluid person to back up my paper. Although, my professors have allowed me to crowdsource info!

So, I ask you all, what does it mean to you when there is genderfluid/non-binary/trans representation in a character in your preferred entertainment? How about just the actor themselves being the representation, even if theyre playing a cis role? How do you feel about female-presenting people playing male-presenting parts and vice versa? What do you feel if/when you see representation of your gender? Why?

Lastly, how long do you feel non-cis-gender people have been around? Why? Do you feel that the recent naming of different genders (as in anything other than just male and female) has helped or hindered the process of allowing non-cis-gender people to become accepted in the society you live in?

I have tried to make the questions as neutral as possible so I don't lead you to answer one way or another. Feel free to answer any of these questions, or whatever you feel may be related that you feel strongly about. Anything helps!

At one point, a friend told me he though I might be trans, but that wasn't it.

I still just use male pronouns typically, but I'm okay with whatever really because I'm just about all of the things at some point.

So, crash course on me.

23,2019-01-07 13:33:08,adhp3t,8,1,"Hi. I’m here to ask about something. Is what I’m experiencing considered dysphoria? 

Whenever I have to get up to go to school in the morning, everything’s fine until I open my closet and see my skirt hanging there. I feel so horrible and uncomfortable wearing it. I don’t feel like myself.
I hate it when my family says “you’re a beautiful young lady” or “you’re a lovely girl, dear.” 
I know that they’re only trying to be nice and caring, but I just feel this horrible drop in my stomach when anyone refers to me as a “girl” or “lady”. The word “she” usually goes unnoticed, but sometimes it can really get to me. 
I dislike that my school is very segregated between girls and boys. We have to play sport separately, the girls are required to wear skorts when playing sports and the boys and girls just seem to hate each other in general. Because of this I hate playing sport at school. Actually I just dislike going to school because of that segregation in general. I feel so uncomfortable in the changing rooms so I usually get changed in the bathrooms. 
I also dislike how I have to hang out with the girls. Sure I don’t have to, but I’m too shy to introduce myself to anyone or ask to hang out with anyone (I’m a new student), so the girls just immediately try and drag me along with them. I appreciate their kindness, it’s just I don’t feel like I belong around them. They don’t really have the same interests as me anyways. 
I tried binding a few times (using a small crop top) outside of school and it made me feel so much more confident in my own body.

Is what I’m experiencing considered dysphoria? \n\nWhenever I have to get up to go to school in the morning, everything’s fine until I open my closet and see my skirt hanging there. I feel so horrible and uncomfortable wearing it. I don’t feel like myself.\nI hate it when my family says “you’re a beautiful young lady” or “you’re a lovely girl, dear.” \nI know that they’re only trying to be nice and caring, but I just feel this horrible drop in my stomach when anyone refers to me as a “girl” or “lady”. The word “she” usually goes unnoticed, but sometimes it can really get to me. \nI dislike that my school is very segregated between girls and boys. We have to play sport separately, the girls are required to wear skorts when playing sports and the boys and girls just seem to hate each other in general. Because of this I hate playing sport at school. Actually I just dislike going to school because of that segregation in general. I feel so uncomfortable in the changing rooms so I usually get changed in the bathrooms. \nI also dislike how I have to hang out with the girls. Sure I don’t have to, but I’m too shy to introduce myself to anyone or ask to hang out with anyone (I’m a new student), so the girls just immediately try and drag me along with them. I appreciate their kindness, it’s just I don’t feel like I belong around them. They don’t really have the same interests as me anyways. \nI tried binding a few times (using a small crop top) outside of school and it made me feel so much more confident in my own body.\n\nThere are also lots of other things that make me feel horrible in my body, but I feel like I would be dumping too many of my personal problems into a reddit post.\nThank you all for your support, it really means a lot to me.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Is this dysphoria?

27,2019-01-08 22:00:31,adzi5v,4,1,"First post here. Sorry if this gets long. 

I'm AMAB and recently sort of came out as genderfluid. I'm 29 and have had an interest in women's fashion since I was very young, around 6 years old or so, possibly earlier. I grew up in a very Conservative household in the American South and these kind of interests were not at all encouraged in boys. So, early on I felt shame and embarrassment for this and for years would sneakily crossdress in my mom's clothes whenever my parents were away.  


I got caught by my parents a couple times that I remember. The first time I was pretty young and they mostly just laughed it off as a kid being curious. The next time my mom caught me when I was a teenager and she was a little more worried. Thought maybe I was gay which would never be accepted, but eventually she just chalked it up to me doing this because of a budding interest in girls, a ridiculous premise maybe, but it's the kind of idea a parent will concoct when they don't want to accept the alternatives. This was never brought up again and within a few years I moved out to go to college.  


In college, I mostly suppressed my desires to explore my feminine side. I started dating and getting in relationships with different girls (something I hadn't done at all in high school) which I guess temporarily filled the void, living vicariously through their femininity. 

&amp;#x200B;

I knew that desire was always there, but I wrestled with my own identity and wondering if my desire for feminine expression was worth the potential ridicule or changing the perception of me with those I knew. There was the further confounding aspect to this all in that I did not feel trans insomuch that I did not feel like I no longer felt comfortable being male. I was okay with being male most of the time and I felt further guilty that exploring this side was performative in a way, that I was simply turning on and off femininity when it felt advantageous to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I got in a relationship in my early 20's with a woman to whom I am now married and have a child. This previous year, she hesitantly expressed to me that she had long had a secret attraction to transwomen.   


This came as a bit of a shock to me but was welcome news as it made me realize her thoughts on gender were far more nuanced and progressive than I had initially anticipated. I had suppressed my own desires throughout the relationship, because when we had casually talked about trans or gender non-conforming people in the past, she seemed slightly averse to the idea.

&amp;#x200B;

This emboldened me to come clean to her about my history of crossdressing. She was initially extremely accepting. I was over the moon to the point where I probably pushed too hard starting off. I had finally met someone who accepted a side of me that I thought would never be accepted. It's with her help that we settled upon the label of ""genderfluid."" I did not have a good understanding of this before, but I finally felt like there was some sort of label that truly fit how I felt. 

&amp;#x200B;

We went to the store and picked out some underwear for me. In the coming months, she bought some lingerie, a top, and some make-up for me, but as time went on, she started to push back.   


She became increasingly uncomfortable with me dressing in feminine clothes even at home. She accused me of trying to take her femininity from her and thereby forcing her to some sort of male role in the relationship which she didn't want to take up. Additionally, she became worried that I was actually trans and just suppressing it, especially as I did not declare myself ""genderfluid"" until she helped me find that label, thinking that I had only settled on that as to suppress some sort of true desire to transition and please her. She has said in the past that she wouldn't be able to continue a relationship with me if I were trans, because I would no longer be the same person in her eyes... Though she is attracted to transwomen and to a lesser extent cis women, she is only attracted to them sexually and not romantically and thus doesn't see herself being in a relationship with anyone other than a cis male, specifically the cis male she thought I was and is now having to change her whole perception of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back in the summer, after she brought up the idea of shaving my body hair and whether I would want to do it. I had only shaved my legs once before as a teenager, but I was anxious to try it again. I shaved my legs and kept up with it for a few weeks before she declared she did not like and missed the hair on my legs. She also made it clear she did not want me shaving any other parts of my body hair. This has been particularly distressing as I genuinely like the way having smooth skin feels. I feel like I could give up the clothes part more easily, but obviously my body hair or lack thereof isn't really something I can hide from my partner. I shaved my legs a few weeks ago and it upset her a lot and she made some disparaging comments that also upset me. So, I kind of just dropped the whole thing after that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I now feel comfortable in my genderfluidity and want to express it more and I have an idea in mind about how I would want to present myself in public (still male but with a feminine flair of sorts when the feeling is right, basically androgynous in many ways), but I feel like her push back as only made me more anxious and less certain. For so long, I've been ashamed of this part of myself but feel like I don't have to anymore. It's just hard because I feel like while I have found acceptance for myself, I don't know if my wife will find that same acceptance and her tolerance for it seems to be dwindling more and more each day. Some days, I just want to be able to throw on an outfit consisting of a slightly feminine women's top, skinny jeans and some cool gender neutral boots. But she has become increasingly weary of me even venturing out in any clothing she perceives has a ""feminine cut,"" unless it's absolutely for a special occasion going out outfit that calls for a bolder look. It feels like she has now taken the mantle of shame, and I hate that.

&amp;#x200B;

She helped me find a few mostly European clothing boutiques that have more fun and androgynous styled men's clothing. And while I've found tons of stuff I like on these sites, it's often more expensive and there's not the same ability to try it on with many of these stores not having U.S. based locations or at least locations near me.  I like the ability to go to the thrift store and try on all types of clothing, men or women's.

Plus, with my body type, it's much easier to find women's clothing that fits in any given store. I'm 6'2 but only 150lbs. So men's clothing can often be too baggy or too loose, unless I order harder to find sizing online or limit myself to the aforementioned pricey European stores. Although my wife has expressed that she would like for me to be more muscular, I really like my thin body. It's a bit of a source of pride for me, and I like clothing that shows it off or accentuates it. My wife is plus size though and also has expressed discomfort and some jealousy at me being able to fit into a much smaller size. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone else here had to deal with similar issues? How did you get through it, if at all? Is it worth questioning a relationship over your own perceived inability to fully express your gender duality or is it better to continue to compromise in hopes the person eventually opens up?

People on the non binary sub suggested I check out over here, I’ve always had masculine and feminine interests since I was young. I could never really put a name on it though because I didn’t understand the concept of gender fluidity back then just all I knew was sometimes I felt like a girl and sometimes I felt like a boy. 

I’ve struggled with my gender issues for many years which has had me going through phases of suppressing my other side but over time I’ve realised I can’t keep hiding it anymore, it makes me too unhappy and I hate not being myself. 

Only a few people know about this part of me but I’m hoping to slowly let more and more people know. 

Just a question for everyone here though? When you change into the other personality is it like you’re still you just different or do you feel like you’re actually a seperate person? I’ve had people tell me that I’m basically a completely different person between both sides but I don’t even notice myself completely switching like they’ve said.

42,2019-01-11 04:47:03,aertqw,1,1,"Hey everyone! I'm new to this sub-reddit, so sorry if this kind of post has already been done to death, but I was hoping this might be a good way to learn more about the community and to better understand other people's experiences and become a better ally.

I guess a few things to start. First, I have identified as a male my whole life, and I still do. Second, I'm not aware of knowing any gender-fluid or transgender people. I don't avoid anyone for that reason, I've just never happened to meet someone who identifies that way, as far as I know. Third, while I don't personally have the experience so I have questions, I do NOT challenge the validity of gender fluidity. I hope none of my ignorance comes off as insensitive or downright offensive. If something I say offends anyone, please understand it was unintentional, but don't hesitate to let me know so that I can improve. I completely support anyone who identifies as gender-fluid, and I want everyone to live their best, happiest lives.

Onto the point of this (already overlong post), I have a few questions I was hoping someone with different experiences could help me understand.

1. How do you know that you are gender fluid? Is it at all similar to any kind of feeling someone who doesn't identify as gender fluid could understand?

2. When you realize you are gender fluid, is it from a physical, mental, or emotional sensation? Is it a mix? And is it different for everyone?

3. How do you know when you're gender fluid instead of just the gender you were biologically born into with a tendency for traits typically associated with the other gender? 

Again, I really hope none of the ignorance in those questions came of as insulting or argumentative. I'm not here to attack anyone or to start some kind of debate, I'm genuinely trying to better understand people's feelings so that I can be a better ally.

I'll be using female pronouns to refer to my partner as she's more comfortable with those at the moment

Anyways, I've been dating my partner for a while now and she's been getting more comfortable presenting more male lately and occasionally using male terms to refer to herself. She's described her gender as ""¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"" on several occasions but doesn't really want to label herself in any strict way.

This morning we were talking about a friend of hers who's questioning their gender at the moment and I suggested administering the button test. (I'm sure y'all are familiar). She asked me what it was, and when I explained it, she responded with almost no hesitation that she'd rather a ""sort of genderfluid shapeshifter sort of deal"". I'm more familiar with binary trans responses, but I thought that might be a pretty indicative.

I'm trying to support her in any way I can, encouraging her when she's  nervous about presenting male, using the pronouns and gendering her correctly in context, etc. But, I'll admit it's kind of difficult to address it without coming across as pushy regarding gender stuff.

But also kind of thankful I wasn't because I know I would've grown up to be my narcissistic, conservative, religious father. Ever since I started uni and exploring identities, I've discovered that I'm mostly attracted to women and sometimes others, and that I'm low key afraid of sex though not opposed to it. I've started coming to terms with the thought that I may have never thought of myself as a woman, but when I do feel my most feminine I hate thinking I could be anyone else if that makes sense. I've always just felt somewhere in-between.

So here I am just putting my thoughts out there so I can't deny them later as being fake or non-existent. 

I don't hate having been born a woman, and I don't dislike femininity. I sometimes wish I could be a man. I wish I could be more masculine and more androgynous. I really just fear what others would think. I just want to try to be me without fear.

I've also had a complicated relationship with my chest because C-cups don't allow me to wear what I want to wear.

I've also had the thought of going by a more andro nickname after I graduate. And just being more andro in general because no one really needs to know what's going on in my pants, and I don't feel too strongly in any direction to really care how people see me as long as I feel like myself.

I guess a really big fear of mine is being seen as a transtrender, just here for attention.

1. Are there specific days like a pattern where she will feel like a male/female or are the days just random?
2. Would I still call her my girlfriend or would I use a different pronoun to introduce her to people because of her gender fluid?
3. How can I adjust myself more easily to her male side when it appears?
4. How can I better prepare ourselves emotionally for the change?
5. Would she make any body changes with her being genderfluid?
