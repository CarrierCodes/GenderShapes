1) how long on T will I develop a deeper voice and a bit more of a masculine appearence? I dont see myself on it for the rest of my life because I dont want to be a super masculine man, instead pretty and androgynous but still have more masculinity than I have now (I'm TOO damn feminine)

2) do you gain a lot of weight on it? I know obviously fat moves around and redistributes and more muscle tone can be gained. I mean more of in terms of would it make me go from slender to too chubby for my stature? 

3) how do you go about beginning it? Can you just ask your doctor or do you need to go through a therapist first?

I'd like to satisfy my curiosity. :)"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Question about hormones and voice changes...', 'created': 1391397258.0}",

The bad days have struck again. I can't stop thinking about my hair. It touches my shoulders now. I haven't cut it since last May. The last time I had it cut, I asked my friend to leave as much length as he could, because I wanted to grow it out again. Years and years ago I had a braid down to my ass, and I called it a weapon, because if I turned my head fast it would snap like a whip. My hair was thick and full and long, long, long. I have been missing that braid, and full buns, and the other fancy hairstyles I could make with it.

I still want to grow it out, but my hair is thin and fragile from years of cutting it but not really *caring* for it. Yet I feel a terrible weight of being seen as a girl--or a woman, I suppose, because I'm nearly 25 and at some point I stop being a child, right?

So at the same time as I desperately want to grow it out--to get my weapon back--I want to cut it short again. In either direction lies dissonance and dysphoria. I am uncomfortable in my body. I am uncomfortable with my appearance. It doesn't seem to have a solution, because I can't simultaneously have long hair and short hair. I can't simultaneously be seen as a girl, a boy, and neither. (Except for a few of my best beloved friends who do have the power to see me this way.)

I stopped cutting my skin by starting to cut my hair instead. I don't know what it means that I feel the urge to grow it now. I am a very different person as of late--I am more settled, a little more stable, and a lot less likely to hurt myself, thanks be to my almighty frontal lobe which has apparently finally calmed the fuck down.

My skin is humming with the feeling that my body parts are all the wrong size and shape. Some bits are too big and some are too small.

I have been missing that braid, and full buns, and the other fancy hairstyles I could make with it.\n\nI still want to grow it out, but my hair is thin and fragile from years of cutting it but not really *caring* for it. Yet I feel a terrible weight of being seen as a girl--or a woman, I suppose, because I'm nearly 25 and at some point I stop being a child, right?\n\nSo at the same time as I desperately want to grow it out--to get my weapon back--I want to cut it short again. In either direction lies dissonance and dysphoria. I am uncomfortable in my body. I am uncomfortable with my appearance. It doesn't seem to have a solution, because I can't simultaneously have long hair and short hair. I can't simultaneously be seen as a girl, a boy, and neither. (Except for a few of my best beloved friends who do have the power to see me this way.)\n\nI stopped cutting my skin by starting to cut my hair instead. I don't know what it means that I feel the urge to grow it now. I am a very different person as of late--I am more settled, a little more stable, and a lot less likely to hurt myself, thanks be to my almighty frontal lobe which has apparently finally calmed the fuck down.\n\nMy skin is humming with the feeling that my body parts are all the wrong size and shape. Some bits are too big and some are too small. Some are there that shouldn't be, and others should be but aren't. I want a braid I can sit on, and I want to buzz my head. I cannot be the thing I want to be, because it doesn't exist, so what can I do?"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Unbreakable dysphoria.', 'created': 1391949542.0}",

Today I booked an apointment to se a psychiatrist/youth worker  on thursday to talk about starting a so called ""gender investigation"" to try and find out Who/what I am and also how I want to live/look.
This all feels very scary and taking the step to actually talk about this for the first time is making me feel very nervous.
I don't know what changes I will want to make for myself. 

I’ve never been able to pinpoint my gender identity. I am physically a female. I am very shy and quiet which many would interpret as very feminine. But when I feel comfortable I tend to act more like a guy. 
I mainly feel comfortable looking very guyish but would like to be able to pass as both male and female.

Since I met my boyfriend about one year ago I started dressing more feminine and grow my hair out. 
I think I did this in order to “fit in” as a girlfriend. And also because I felt very intimidated by girls since I felt like I had to compete against their beauty and femeninity. 
Now my boyfriend is studying abroad and I feel like I can think clearly about these things. And I’ve noticed how my self esteem has dropped since I started forcing myself to be more feminine. 
I’m probably going to get the scissors out soon and just cut all of my hair off.

I've always felt comfortable and happy when being mistaken for a guy, but I don't want to pass as one all the time so it’s not that I want a full transformation.
What I do want is a slightly deeper voice, more muscles and smaller boobs (and my old self esteem back).

A funny thing is, whenever I see a muscular dude I go ""Damn he's so hot ...I'll never be able to look that good :(""
Shapeshifter powers would be nice.

On to the questions!

So basically what I want to know is, do you think it could be possible to alter my voice slightly if I go on T and then get off it when I feel that my voice is where I want it to be? 

How/when should I tell my boyfriend that I’m... well, something other than just female? How have these kinds of conversations worked out for you? How did your SO, family and friends react? 
Perhaps I just shouldn’t say anything. Just start acting and looking the way I’m comfortable and let them ask questions when/if they feel like it.

If you have taken or are taking hormones, please tell me about your experiences, were there any unexpected effects? How do people react to you now as compared to before? etcetera.

Were you entierly certain of what your gender was before you came out to the world?

This is a problem that's been troubling me for some time: what do you do if you need to send a polite/formal letter/e-mail of request to someone?

For instance, I'm a history grad student, and I'm planning a research visit to a library to use some items in their rare books collection.  A lot of times these libraries require advance notice for visits such as these, and I'm e-mailing them to inquire if they have such a policy.

Well, I'm MAAB and I'm bigender or trans and genderqueer or something, I'm not entirely sure yet, but I've got time to figure it out. 

A big question I've had for a while is shaving vs waxing? Which do you guys prefer, what brands of razors, skin care and/or waxes you use if you do it at home or what you get when you go to a spa or salon. 

For anyone else who's male, leaning towards the feminine side or is a trans woman, what brands of clothing do you like best? I personally like close-fitting stuff like spandex, leggings, skinny jeans, and baggy shirts so I can get away with wearing a bra. Would you recommend any stores to me?

I suppose you could say I’m bigender, but I don’t feel like what it seems like every other bigender person is like, where they’re like “today I feel like being a girl!” “Today I want to be a boy!” It’s like, it goes through long term phases, of identifying as female or male. Like phases usually being a year or two long. And the whole time I don’t know when it’s going to switch, it’s like waiting for the shoe to drop, so I can’t get comfortable in one... I can feel it creeping up on me. Waiting to lose my identity.

I really wish I understood this, like, is it a hormones thing? Do I have PCOS maybe? I fit a bunch of the symptoms. If I got treated, would the feeling like a male just go away? Or maybe if I took T, would that nudge me over to the male side?

Right now I have been in a male phase for about six months and it’s torturous. I would given anything to be a garden variety ftm and to be able to transition and feel like I’m not just lying and pretending to be a guy when I identify as one online, then I could be a real one.

I don’t want to adopt an androgynous look or manner because that isn’t me. I’m either a really girly girl or a really girly guy. Right now I’ve just been trying to pretend my physical self doesn’t exist and ignoring it, and get really depressed when I catch myself in a mirror.

Lately I’ve been kind of rock bottom so I kind of don’t have anything to lose. I know low-dose T is an illusion but I don't care anymore. Do any non-binary afabs have experience with T? What affect did it have on your identity?

 So I just found out about a new class of drugs called SERMs, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, designed to prevent breast cancer without breaking hips. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are the 2 big ones but they all do basically 2 things - act as an agonist (stimulate growth) in bones and uterine lining, and act as an antagonist in breast tissue. 

 Hey, that's all our problems solved, right?
But I can't find anyone talking about it at all. The side effects\* I found are comparable to spiro, mostly to do with veins and clot risk if you sit on your ass all day. Did it just magically evade the attention of the internet or is there a good reason no one's using it?  

I can think of two possibilities - 1. it only acts in ""breast tissue"" if you already have breast tissue, so it wouldn't prevent the creation of breasts, or 2. the dosage needed to prevent breast growth is dangerously high compared to the dosage for preventing breast cancer.

 \*^(raloxifene seems to be safer than tamixofen, or at least more researched)

..but I often feel like I do.

Hello Reddit! I've been on this site (though not specifically this subreddit) for about a year now, and I'm using this throwaway account to gauge some opinions. (I'm a guy...at least at first appearance to most people I know in this world.) I was inspired by /u/InquisitiveYoungLad [1] to ask anonymously.

In 2007 I was in a class and had to perform a skit about abuse with two girls. Now, I'm a video gamer and a sports freak, though I am horribly unathletic, but I'm not much of a traditional guy at all. Being in quite a few honors and advanced classes there have been times where I have been all but surrounded with girls.

Anyway, for the purpose of the skit, the two girls realized having me play a guy was not workable, and so they asked me to be a girl.

I was quite shell shocked at this request since it was not something I'd ever do, but I really didn't have much of a choice. The one girl put a ponytail (even if it was 1 cm long) in my short hair, and I role played the skit as ""Jasmine"" (you may call me that here, not my real female name). I was quite surprised to enjoy that experience and began playing ""Jasmine"" to a couple of school friends. I also adopted Jasmine as a sort of online persona for parts of myself, and that way I met a couple online friends as well. By 2010 I was regularly RPing Jasmine with a couple of them, and I was inspired to begin writing a novel with Jasmine as the main character a year later.

In the fall of 2012, after about two months of hospice care, a close relative of mine died out of town. My family had to travel for their funeral, and as it was the first death in the family to really impact me, I was shaken. While I am a political and social liberal, I did not expect my fairly conventional Christian faith to be gutted so quickly. I started looking at other options faithwise. And at the same time, I was experiencing a growing feeling rise within me that I was Jasmine, not my guy self. Even a faith retreat I went on could not stop Jasmine's momentum. It was like I had caught Jasmine Fever. At this time I also had a school friend who really was encouraging to me but had her own personal issues, and her cloud of darkness extended over me at times. What's more, my parents didn't know that Jasmine was growing so quickly. I couldn't cross dress or act trans for a variety of social and family reasons, but that was how I felt inside. I felt like my guy self had become a shell housing Jasmine and not much else.

I tried to tell my parents in May, and at that point I kinda broke down emotionally, realizing I probably wasn't ready to embark on the trans road. For a while, the feminine feelings subsided, but within a few months they were back and they still gnaw at me. Jasmine and my guy self love to clash, and I often wonder, what if I had always been her? I feel slightly more masculine than I did then, but I still relate better to girls and inside wish that one day I could feel what it is like to be a girl. I'm not sure what I'm feeling now, where I am, or where I am meant to be with Jasmine. That's why I'm here, to ask people more seasoned about these sorts of feelings. I can't decode them in full, and Jasmine is still gnawing at me, making me wish I could become her... And it doesn't help that another family member died recently, with similar arrangements.

Any thoughts and comments are appreciated. During the height of Jasmine Fever I truly felt trans, something that is not so much the case now. I still have incredible empathy for trans people and all they have to go through, and my faith life is still quite weak and vulnerable—oh yes, and I'm now in college. Any advice is of great use to me.

I'm AFAB but I identify as genderqueer and pansexual. I present pretty masculine (bind my chest, etc.) although I'm not macho or anything. I'd probably equate my presentation to ""somewhat effeminate dude"" if that makes sense.

I'm in a relationship with an AMAB person who also identifies as genderqueer. Also a ""somewhat effeminate dude."" I am absolutely in love with them.

I only started binding my chest about halfway through the relaysh (which has been maybe a year and half by now) and as I have become more comfortable with this person, I've presented as more and more nonbinary (I tend to present fairly feminine to people I haven't met because I'm afraid of judgment/rejection).

Yesterday it finally came out that my partner is really not physically attracted to me, and they said that it started when I started binding my chest. They said that as much as they'd like to find me attractive, they ""really only like girls"" and I'm too masculine for them.

However, throughout my whole life I've always felt like I just didn't fit completely as a female. I don't think I'm FtM, but there are a lot of very masculine/androgynous aspects to my personality.

* -I'm bisexual
* -I feel a strong desire to have a more masculine body
* -I switch between whether or not I wear makeup and whether I wear men's or women's clothes
* -I feel like I would be the more ""dominant"" person in a relationship, if that's the correct way of phrasing that
* -I feel very uncomfortable with the more feminine aspects of my body (hips, curves, breasts) but don't necessarily feel uncomfortable with my genitals

Since I can't really pull off a super masculine look (I'm short, curvy, and dysphoric as fuck) I generally present as androgynous erring on the feminine side of things.  

This weekend I went to a big convention in a local city that tends to be pretty sexually themed.  I lost track of how many comments I got about my breast size.  I also had someone call me a lesbian because of my hair, which was weird because I was holding my boyfriend's hand at the time (I'm pansexual, but beside the point, being targeted as female made me feel weird, especially because his only apparent reason for doing so was because of my hairstyle and mens' shirt).  

Oh, and throw in the run-in we had with my boyfriend's ex (a pretty good-looking cis-male, kind of stung my pride) who has been extremely unpleasant to me in the past, without going into any long stories.  That was just the shitty icing on the shit cake.  My boyfriend of course understood why I was upset (how can a genderfluid faab who's gained lots of weight measure up against an attractive cis-male who was apparently good enough for like 5 years??) and reassured me that I'm enough for him... so I'm okay about that, but the whole experience definitely did NOT help with everything else being thrown at me all at once.

He was just so open and natural with that question that it actually took me by surprise.  I actually had to ask him to repeat himself because I wasn't sure I'd heard him correctly!  And then of course I awkwardly stuttered my way through ""Oh, I'm fine with any, I'm not pronoun sensitive, but thank you so much for asking!"" and had to stare everywhere but at him until the tears went out from my eyes, but WOW that was a nice gesture from a total stranger.  I sent him a quick note later (I took a card!) to thank him for the kindness that really made my entire day and really soothed a lot of my frazzled nerves, as well as a few other kind words he had for me regarding my bust.

Really since the summer of 2012 (when I was 17) I've been figuring things out with my sexual orientation/gender identity. The former I finally got down a few months ago (I'm pansexual), though even early on I thought ""I kinda wanna temporarily go around as a woman.""

Recently a friend joked that I should crossdress, and then I thought ""it must be nice to look passing as female."" From then I've been thinking more and more about being female.

I've had quite a few autogynephilic fantasies, though when I'm a girl I find myself more attracted to men than anyone else (though plenty of women too).

Whenever I do think about being a girl I get kinda unhappy when I notice that I still have a male body, and kinda wish that sometimes my friends would see me as female.

However this isn't the universal feeling for me. Most of the time I'm perfectly comfortable as a male, don't mind presenting as male and don't mind my friends and family calling me male, but occasionally it just feels entirely out of place.

Some days this stuff bothers me a lot, and others it doesn't matter as much. \nI'm just a bit confused, and I wouldn't even be concerned with labelling myself or whatever if it wasn't for the fact that everyone refers to me as a girl and calls me by female pronouns (I've only talked to one of my very close friends about this), and this is starting to make me pretty uncomfortable sometimes. \nI don't know if this explanation actually makes any sense, but any advice would be much appreciated.

I have been in a relationship for about eight months with my partner, a cis guy.  Most of the time he is quite sensitive to my gender, usually skewing too far toward the girl side (much less annoying than the alternative) if anything.

Today I booked an apointment to se a psychiatrist/youth worker  on thursday to talk about starting a so called ""gender investigation"" to try and find out Who/what I am and also how I want to live/look.
This all feels very scary and taking the step to actually talk about this for the first time is making me feel very nervous.
I don't know what changes I will want to make for myself. 

I’ve never been able to pinpoint my gender identity. I am physically a female. I am very shy and quiet which many would interpret as very feminine. But when I feel comfortable I tend to act more like a guy. 
I mainly feel comfortable looking very guyish but would like to be able to pass as both male and female.

Since I met my boyfriend about one year ago I started dressing more feminine and grow my hair out. 
I think I did this in order to “fit in” as a girlfriend. And also because I felt very intimidated by girls since I felt like I had to compete against their beauty and femeninity. 
Now my boyfriend is studying abroad and I feel like I can think clearly about these things. And I’ve noticed how my self esteem has dropped since I started forcing myself to be more feminine. 
I’m probably going to get the scissors out soon and just cut all of my hair off.

I've always felt comfortable and happy when being mistaken for a guy, but I don't want to pass as one all the time so it’s not that I want a full transformation.
What I do want is a slightly deeper voice, more muscles and smaller boobs (and my old self esteem back).

A funny thing is, whenever I see a muscular dude I go ""Damn he's so hot ...I'll never be able to look that good :(""
Shapeshifter powers would be nice.

On to the questions!

So basically what I want to know is, do you think it could be possible to alter my voice slightly if I go on T and then get off it when I feel that my voice is where I want it to be? 

How/when should I tell my boyfriend that I’m... well, something other than just female? How have these kinds of conversations worked out for you? How did your SO, family and friends react? 
Perhaps I just shouldn’t say anything. Just start acting and looking the way I’m comfortable and let them ask questions when/if they feel like it.

If you have taken or are taking hormones, please tell me about your experiences, were there any unexpected effects? How do people react to you now as compared to before? etcetera.

Were you entierly certain of what your gender was before you came out to the world?

(edit. please forgive my grammar mistakes. I'm not a native english speaker)

This round of questions regards altering appearance for different gender identities.

First on the list: how do I make it appear that I have breasts? I'm unsure what the official term for such a tool/item would be. I'm thinking something like a reverse binder? Is this a real thing? I'm clueless.

Second, the pelvic area: I understand that ""tucking"" is the verb I'm describing, but how do I go about it? Anything I should know [regarding health concerns, etc.] surrounding it? Also, is there a way to make it appear that my hips are slightly wider?

Well, I'm MAAB and I'm bigender or trans and genderqueer or something, I'm not entirely sure yet, but I've got time to figure it out. 

A big question I've had for a while is shaving vs waxing? Which do you guys prefer, what brands of razors, skin care and/or waxes you use if you do it at home or what you get when you go to a spa or salon. 

For anyone else who's male, leaning towards the feminine side or is a trans woman, what brands of clothing do you like best? I personally like close-fitting stuff like spandex, leggings, skinny jeans, and baggy shirts so I can get away with wearing a bra. Would you recommend any stores to me?

Also I have the question about going out in public, I've asked this before but I feel like it's still really hard for me to relieve the stress of going out in public, I've tried a bunch of different stuff. Anything from counting to ten, to distracting myself with other things, to doing breathing exercise, to smoking pot a few times.

95,2014-02-18 19:51:44,1y9paf,3,6,"So I tend to just label myself as “genderqueer” because... Well, it’s weird... I am afab, and don’t feel androgynous. I suppose you could say I’m bigender, but I don’t feel like what it seems like every other bigender person is like, where they’re like “today I feel like being a girl!” “Today I want to be a boy!” It’s like, it goes through long term phases, of identifying as female or male. Like phases usually being a year or two long. And the whole time I don’t know when it’s going to switch, it’s like waiting for the shoe to drop, so I can’t get comfortable in one... I can feel it creeping up on me. Waiting to lose my identity.

I really wish I understood this, like, is it a hormones thing? Do I have PCOS maybe? I fit a bunch of the symptoms. If I got treated, would the feeling like a male just go away? Or maybe if I took T, would that nudge me over to the male side?

 So I just found out about a new class of drugs called SERMs, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, designed to prevent breast cancer without breaking hips. Tamoxifen and raloxifene are the 2 big ones but they all do basically 2 things - act as an agonist (stimulate growth) in bones and uterine lining, and act as an antagonist in breast tissue. 

 Hey, that's all our problems solved, right?
But I can't find anyone talking about it at all. The side effects\* I found are comparable to spiro, mostly to do with veins and clot risk if you sit on your ass all day. Did it just magically evade the attention of the internet or is there a good reason no one's using it?  

I can think of two possibilities - 1. it only acts in ""breast tissue"" if you already have breast tissue, so it wouldn't prevent the creation of breasts, or 2. the dosage needed to prevent breast growth is dangerously high compared to the dosage for preventing breast cancer.

..but I often feel like I do.

Hello Reddit! I've been on this site (though not specifically this subreddit) for about a year now, and I'm using this throwaway account to gauge some opinions. (I'm a guy...at least at first appearance to most people I know in this world.) I was inspired by /u/InquisitiveYoungLad [1] to ask anonymously.

In 2007 I was in a class and had to perform a skit about abuse with two girls. Now, I'm a video gamer and a sports freak, though I am horribly unathletic, but I'm not much of a traditional guy at all. Being in quite a few honors and advanced classes there have been times where I have been all but surrounded with girls.

Anyway, for the purpose of the skit, the two girls realized having me play a guy was not workable, and so they asked me to be a girl.

I was quite shell shocked at this request since it was not something I'd ever do, but I really didn't have much of a choice. The one girl put a ponytail (even if it was 1 cm long) in my short hair, and I role played the skit as ""Jasmine"" (you may call me that here, not my real female name). I was quite surprised to enjoy that experience and began playing ""Jasmine"" to a couple of school friends. I also adopted Jasmine as a sort of online persona for parts of myself, and that way I met a couple online friends as well. By 2010 I was regularly RPing Jasmine with a couple of them, and I was inspired to begin writing a novel with Jasmine as the main character a year later.

In the fall of 2012, after about two months of hospice care, a close relative of mine died out of town. My family had to travel for their funeral, and as it was the first death in the family to really impact me, I was shaken. While I am a political and social liberal, I did not expect my fairly conventional Christian faith to be gutted so quickly. I started looking at other options faithwise. And at the same time, I was experiencing a growing feeling rise within me that I was Jasmine, not my guy self. Even a faith retreat I went on could not stop Jasmine's momentum. It was like I had caught Jasmine Fever. At this time I also had a school friend who really was encouraging to me but had her own personal issues, and her cloud of darkness extended over me at times. What's more, my parents didn't know that Jasmine was growing so quickly. I couldn't cross dress or act trans for a variety of social and family reasons, but that was how I felt inside. I felt like my guy self had become a shell housing Jasmine and not much else.

I tried to tell my parents in May, and at that point I kinda broke down emotionally, realizing I probably wasn't ready to embark on the trans road. For a while, the feminine feelings subsided, but within a few months they were back and they still gnaw at me. Jasmine and my guy self love to clash, and I often wonder, what if I had always been her? I feel slightly more masculine than I did then, but I still relate better to girls and inside wish that one day I could feel what it is like to be a girl. I'm not sure what I'm feeling now, where I am, or where I am meant to be with Jasmine. That's why I'm here, to ask people more seasoned about these sorts of feelings. I can't decode them in full, and Jasmine is still gnawing at me, making me wish I could become her... And it doesn't help that another family member died recently, with similar arrangements.

Any thoughts and comments are appreciated. During the height of Jasmine Fever I truly felt trans, something that is not so much the case now. I still have incredible empathy for trans people and all they have to go through, and my faith life is still quite weak and vulnerable—oh yes, and I'm now in college. Any advice is of great use to me.

I'm AFAB but I identify as genderqueer and pansexual. I present pretty masculine (bind my chest, etc.) although I'm not macho or anything. I'd probably equate my presentation to ""somewhat effeminate dude"" if that makes sense.

I'm in a relationship with an AMAB person who also identifies as genderqueer. Also a ""somewhat effeminate dude."" I am absolutely in love with them. I've never felt this way about anyone before (and I've had intense infatuations in the past)--not a passionate lust kind of love, but caring so much about them that I want to spend the rest of my life with them. We relate on so many levels and have so much in common culturally/socially/etc.

I only started binding my chest about halfway through the relaysh (which has been maybe a year and half by now) and as I have become more comfortable with this person, I've presented as more and more nonbinary (I tend to present fairly feminine to people I haven't met because I'm afraid of judgment/rejection).

Yesterday it finally came out that my partner is really not physically attracted to me, and they said that it started when I started binding my chest. They said that as much as they'd like to find me attractive, they ""really only like girls"" and I'm too masculine for them.

This is killing me. I feel completely fucking awful about myself.

I'm halfway convinced to throw away my binder and wear dresses forever, even though I get mild dysphoria from that. I can't help feeling as though mild dysphoria is nothing compared to the loss of my partner's love.

I have changed physicians because my last one was incompetent, and I am hoping this new one, with the California Transgender Laws for insurance, will help me on my way to HRT.\n\nSo as I\'m about to possibly start HRT, I\'m trying to think of ways to limit the emotional scars reopening so often. I want to break the conditioning, but living with my parents is difficult because while my brother living on his own supports me, and my father is not resisting it, my mother is completely against it, and her resistance is part of the reason they keep opening. Forced social male conditioning has thoroughly wrecked me, so I ask, how do I overcome it?

-I don't hate being a man. It's just that I feel like it doesn't really fit.  
-I'm sexually and romantically attracted to women.  
-I don't watch porn very often, but I do enjoy lesbian porn. Heterosexual, transsexual, and gay porn are not satisfying to me.  
-I enjoy watching lesbian romantic movies.  
-I've had numerous relationships with women. They never quite work out. The relational energy is somehow off. I have difficulties in the bedroom after a while because of all this confusion related to my gender and sexuality.  

Despite this, sometimes I am very manly. In relationships, women often see me as masculine and dominant, even though I don't usually feel that way.

Since I can't really pull off a super masculine look (I'm short, curvy, and dysphoric as fuck) I generally present as androgynous erring on the feminine side of things.  

This weekend I went to a big convention in a local city that tends to be pretty sexually themed.  I lost track of how many comments I got about my breast size.  I also had someone call me a lesbian because of my hair, which was weird because I was holding my boyfriend's hand at the time (I'm pansexual, but beside the point, being targeted as female made me feel weird, especially because his only apparent reason for doing so was because of my hairstyle and mens' shirt).  

Oh, and throw in the run-in we had with my boyfriend's ex (a pretty good-looking cis-male, kind of stung my pride) who has been extremely unpleasant to me in the past, without going into any long stories.  That was just the shitty icing on the shit cake.  My boyfriend of course understood why I was upset (how can a genderfluid faab who's gained lots of weight measure up against an attractive cis-male who was apparently good enough for like 5 years??) and reassured me that I'm enough for him... so I'm okay about that, but the whole experience definitely did NOT help with everything else being thrown at me all at once.

Today, I was wandering around the vendors' area and someone stopped to tell me that he ""liked my style"".

At one point, he stopped himself halfway through a sentence and said ""Hey, what are your pronouns?"" 

He was just so open and natural with that question that it actually took me by surprise.  I actually had to ask him to repeat himself because I wasn't sure I'd heard him correctly!  And then of course I awkwardly stuttered my way through ""Oh, I'm fine with any, I'm not pronoun sensitive, but thank you so much for asking!"" and had to stare everywhere but at him until the tears went out from my eyes, but WOW that was a nice gesture from a total stranger.  I sent him a quick note later (I took a card!) to thank him for the kindness that really made my entire day and really soothed a lot of my frazzled nerves, as well as a few other kind words he had for me regarding my bust. 

His one simple question had me smiling the rest of the day and feeling MUCH more confident with my appearance.  A little consideration really does go a LONG way.

Really since the summer of 2012 (when I was 17) I've been figuring things out with my sexual orientation/gender identity. The former I finally got down a few months ago (I'm pansexual), though even early on I thought ""I kinda wanna temporarily go around as a woman.""

Recently a friend joked that I should crossdress, and then I thought ""it must be nice to look passing as female."" From then I've been thinking more and more about being female.

I've had quite a few autogynephilic fantasies, though when I'm a girl I find myself more attracted to men than anyone else (though plenty of women too).

Whenever I do think about being a girl I get kinda unhappy when I notice that I still have a male body, and kinda wish that sometimes my friends would see me as female.

My girlfriend and I are looking at options for her SRS (MtF). Our country doesn't really offer SRS so we have to travel over seas and the endo doctor here has recommended Bangkok.
