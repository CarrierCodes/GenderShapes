0,2014-10-02 01:36:27,2i1tqd,15,12,"I've been bashing my head against this subject for about two weeks now, and I've finally come to the point where I just don't know what's up or down.

I need help

I'm an 18 year-old male (term used loosely here) interested in females. I had a plenty boyish childhood. Batman, power rangers, vidya games, etc. According to my parents, I never exhibited any signs of transsexuality except for one whole summer where I wore nothing but a pink dress (I was riding that hype train HARD.) I don't really remember if I held any notable interests in girl toys; I vaguely recall /wanting/ to play with my sister's barbie house, but I definitely don't remember it materializing into anything. Nothing really significant that I remember, basically. 

Growing up, I was pretty feminine, though. I didn't like sports or have any real desire to play them despite my dad's persistent encouragement to do so. I didn't like the idea of being strong, masculine, or really anything that might result in such. It absolutely repulses me now. Probably the most notable of my friendships growing up were my two female friends, not that I could make any other friends anyway. Now that I think of it, I don't think I've ever intentionally befriended a male. And even if I did, the very act of inviting them over seemed hellish. I felt like I didn't know what to do or what they'd want to do, so I generally avoided stuff like that. I did like hanging out in groups, though; the reason, I imagine, is that I could just play along until I could leave without insulting the host. I never had that problem with girls, though. 

I wouldn't say I developed a conscious desire to be female until about age 15 or 16. I began fantasizing about the idea of being a female, which always took me away from my studies, social interactions, and generally occupied my mind more than anything else. I had a lot of sexual fantasies as a female in a heterosexual relationship. I had a lot of fantasies which consisted of just /being female/. It got to the point where I would actually crack a smile as if it provided me with some sort of elation. I thought a lot about waking up in a world where I was female and had always been so, which, invariably, seemed worlds better than living as a male.

I'd just take all of that (as well as some other stuff I'm not going to mention here) as 'good enough' evidence for being transsexual, but I'm having trouble with one thing.

The Dysphoria.

I can't say I've ever experienced what a lot of transsexuals have purportedly experienced at the level they have. I've never really liked having a penis (erections suck, especially because I naturally sit to pee), but it hasn't been until recently that I've seen it as *vaguely* foreign. I've had the same issue with my chest, too. I haven't really had an issue with not having breasts until, just a few weeks ago, I lifted up my arms to stretch after showering, noticed my chest, and could just see breasts. I stayed like that, frozen, for about a minute, just looking. I couldn't wrap my head around it. Ever since, I can't stop noticing that my genitals seem like they're separate from the rest of my body and that I /should/ have breasts. Body hair, too, hasn't been an issue at all, and I'd be hard pressed to say that it's a real issue now. I did a full-body shave recently and just LOVE smoothness. I have zero desire to go back to not trimming body hair, but, then again, I think I /could/ live with not shaving religiously in a world where I don't transition.

My main concern coming out of this is what if I'm just tricking myself into thinking I'm trans? I really, really do want to be a woman. That is something I'm confident in saying. I at least /think/ I want breasts, a vagina, a smaller waist, wider hips, longer hair, etc. But what if the slight physical dysphoria is all manufactured out of my head and is just validating some transtrender mentality? I pose a lot in front of the mirror, expecting to find curvier physique, plumper lips, longer hair that I could style, etc. but is that necessarily transsexualism? Am I just a really, really feminine man? Note: I never do that kind of stuff out in public. I rarely talk in a feminine voice, walk in a feminine way (I kind of tend to swing my ass), any of that stuff when around my heterocissexual friends. I just get really scared of what they'll think.

Sorry that this is probably so shitty and poorly worded/written. I probably left out a lot of important details. I have really poor organizational abilities and get a little too lazy to spend more than an hour writing.

Please help. I'll be trying on my first dress tomorrow. (haven't had the opportunity since I really decided to begin the early stages of my transtion, I moved away from my house and don't have access to women's clothing.)

I'm out to my gf. 


  Wednesday she saw an email in my inbox from a local sexuality/gender support place I went to for help and asked the question over text, plainly, ""Do you think you're trans?"" I tried to say I wanted to discuss it in person, but she pushed. So, I told her.

Quickly, things went south.

We both came home from work to discuss it. She knew something was up. She thought at first maybe I had been cheating on her. In fact, I think she was more hoping that would be the case. When she said that she didn't want me ""working on being more feminine"" she had a inkling of what was up, and said it on purpose, because she didn't want it to be true.


As I explained my identity and what I feel I need to do, she said she understood yet she didn't. She doesn't understand the space I inhabit between genders. Be a man or be a woman, but don't be something in between. She doesn't understand why I want to look more androgynous than I do already. She's worried that I'll want to grow a beard and wear a dress. I'm not into genderfuck, I just want to dress how I feel. Present how I feel.


She went back and forth, from confused to angry to hurt and around again. She said we should break up. She feels lost in this relationship, and she's lost herself too. The space will give us both time to find ourselves, and if that brings us back together then it does. I said I wanted to walk this together. To grow together. To use this to strengthen each other. I guess that's not her thought. Maybe this has been coming for a long time. Maybe she was just waiting for a reason and I served one up on a silver platter. We had some tough spots before, but I thought that things may have been coming around. Perhaps some things are to big to handle. 


We got drunk that night. Rather, she got hammered and I had a few to take the edge off. As things dragged into the night, and the topic abandoned in inebriation, all that was left in my heart was a feeling of devastation. 


It's day 2, and I'm trying not to beat myself up. I know I shouldn't, its not healthy and not my fault. Still a vicious battle rages in my head between doing what I need to confront aspects of myself that have lingered for so long against losing the woman that I love in doing so. I try to tell myself that it's for the best, that brighter things await me, but the heartache I feel gnaws at my ribs, snapping me back, reminding me of where I am.


In this time, we haven't really said more than a few words to each other. Yesterday she was hung over and spent the day in bed. [I went and got a tattoo](http://imgur.com/ivlzAbo) that I had been planning on getting for awhile, but now seems all the more appropriate (right, /u/Parkertron?). Today again she's staying home. I still hope against hope that she comes around, but I don't know how foolish those dreams may be.


When leaving to get the tattoo and leaving for work today, both times I've said ""I love you"", as I've always done before going anywhere. That way if anything if happened to me and I didn't make it back, they would be the last words she'd hear me say. Both times, as she's laid there and didn't respond, it was all I could do not to collapse in tears.


I'm sorry again, for the downer post and for the wall of text. I figured some would wonder how it'd all turn out. I'm really not certain myself how it will. All I can do is go on, and like my tattoo says, *this too shall pass.*

5,2014-10-03 22:44:56,2i8bjg,30,4,"Warning: offensive wall of text **now edited to correct ignorance and hate-mongering**

tl;dr: I feel that gender fluidity (edit: genderqueer) sabotages legitimate transgender progress. 
Edit: I acknowledge that everyone on the LGBT/GRSM spectrum faces difficulty, especially those stuck somewhere in the middle. It wasn't fair of me to pin my frustrations with the trans struggle on the entirety of a group with even less recognition and legitimization. 

I consider myself a pretty liberal person. I'm a pansexual cis-female and my boyfriend is a heterosexual trans-man. I've been with him since he was in the closet as a lesbian and was the first person to ask if he identified as male. Seeing his pain and struggle to become the physical manifestation of his true identity has been both inspiring and infuriating. Helping him through the insane dysphasia, the pronoun and name swap, the education of the close-minded and ignorant, and his journey of medically and legally earning his gender has really shaped my opinion and solidified my support of the lgbT (emphasis on T) community. 

That said, 

I cannot stand the whole gender-fluid (edit: genderqueer) thing. I feel it makes a mockery of the really serious issue of transgender healthcare and legitimization; (edit: The lack of progress is not the fault of the GQ community) people playing with their own gender is preventing cases like my boyfriend's from being taken seriously. (edit: No one's identity is more valuable than another's!) I feel that a lot of the self-expression I see here is a ploy for attention and counterculture, and there's nothing wrong with that. (edit: Being genderqueer is no more a choice than being trans is in many cases, and even if it is, there honestly is nothing wrong with that.) It becomes wrong when it has consequences like no one taking my boyfriend seriously until his 3rd hospitalization for suicide attempt, the first of which was in 6th grade. (edit: This is not the fault of the GQ community and many genderqueer folks have had similar struggles.) It makes light of a life-or-death circumstance. (edit: Nope.)

On a different, more personal note, I think the invention of genderless pronouns is idiotic. I understand that language is fluid, but getting all huffy when someone uses a word in the dictionary as opposed to your made-up special-snowflake word is just pathetic in my eyes.

It wasn't fair of me to pin my frustrations with the trans struggle on the entirety of a group with even less recognition and legitimization. \n\nI consider myself a pretty liberal person. I'm a pansexual cis-female and my boyfriend is a heterosexual trans-man. I've been with him since he was in the closet as a lesbian and was the first person to ask if he identified as male. Seeing his pain and struggle to become the physical manifestation of his true identity has been both inspiring and infuriating. Helping him through the insane dysphasia, the pronoun and name swap, the education of the close-minded and ignorant, and his journey of medically and legally earning his gender has really shaped my opinion and solidified my support of the lgbT (emphasis on T) community. \n\nThat said, \n\nI cannot stand the whole gender-fluid (edit: genderqueer) thing. I feel it makes a mockery of the really serious issue of transgender healthcare and legitimization; (edit: The lack of progress is not the fault of the GQ community) people playing with their own gender is preventing cases like my boyfriend's from being taken seriously. (edit: No one's identity is more valuable than another's!) I feel that a lot of the self-expression I see here is a ploy for attention and counterculture, and there's nothing wrong with that. (edit: Being genderqueer is no more a choice than being trans is in many cases, and even if it is, there honestly is nothing wrong with that.) It becomes wrong when it has consequences like no one taking my boyfriend seriously until his 3rd hospitalization for suicide attempt, the first of which was in 6th grade. (edit: This is not the fault of the GQ community and many genderqueer folks have had similar struggles.) It makes light of a life-or-death circumstance. (edit: Nope.)\n\nOn a different, more personal note, I think the invention of genderless pronouns is idiotic. I understand that language is fluid, but getting all huffy when someone uses a word in the dictionary as opposed to your made-up special-snowflake word is just pathetic in my eyes. \nEdit: Wow, that was a really shitty thing to say.

So, for those of you who are androgyne, agender, neutrois, and other neutral genders, how would you explain to someone what it means to be neither man nor woman?  Assume a clueless but non-hostile audience.

My strategy, such as it is, is to appeal to the somewhat unchanging center of personal identity.  That place from which ""man"" or ""woman"" so easily arises is cisgendered people (avoiding the confusing term).  And then to explain that I got ""neither"" from that place.

*update* Here's a dual-narrative approach that I'm settling on (edited for brevity and to remove personal details).  I'm going to sit on it for a few days before sending the letter off, but this may be useful to others.

&gt; Take everything that you associate with masculinity and put it into a metaphorical yard.  Then do the same thing with everything feminine, putting all of that into an adjacent yard.  Then, build a low stone wall (not a fence) between them, and put atop this wall everything that you can associate with both genders.  Then, imagine that I walked down that wall, picked up a lot of the attributes from that center place, and then the parts from both of the yards that most appealed to me.

And then there's this section, which I'm going to chop out so I can think about it more.

~~Ask yourself whether you are a man or a woman.  Once you get the answer, search for who gave you the answer.  Try to track it backwards to the source inside you that knows which gender you are.  Try to figure out what the term even means and whether it would still have a meaning if you stripped away all of the stereotypes?  I assume that your answer to the question is instant, absolutely certain, and completely immutable.  That it originates from some deep center of self, a place where there is no questioning, there is simply a full knowledge that this is true, and that your experience is as certain as is your experience of the color blue.~~

~~The answer I get back is ""neither"".  Complete negation leaves an unsatisfying void, and Androgyne fills the void rather nicely.  Nicely enough that while new words that may be more accurate have been coined, I have stuck with this word for a decade.~~

I'm MAAB and have been considering shaving my legs for a while now. A couple of days ago I decided to have a test run using my arms to make sure my technique was fine, so as to avoid the whole ingrown hair/blood everywhere horror stories you read about, and it all went pretty well. I did this, whilst knowing arm shaving isn't talked about all that much, under the impression that it still is a thing. However, when I mentioned it to my gf she said it's actually kind of uncommon and not that many people do it (or rather, not that many people she knows do it).

Hi!

So, I'm genderqueer and mainly feel I'm gender neutral so I looked online at gender neutral outfits and most see, to be all black and geared more towards the male side of things. I was speaking to someone else who gender fluid and she was saying that she dressing neutrally and has her hair short and most people think she's a lesbian.

Anyway, I was wondering (and like I said not meaning to support stereotypes) if any of you gay people dress in typical gay fashion (brighter clothes etc) and why you do this? I would be a great help and encouragement if you could suggest ways I can be more feminine or the kinda clothes I could wear to achieve a Tyler Oakley kinda gay look? It would be like my own interpretation on androgynous.

Also, the boy at my school who I have a crush on (I'm actually pretty gay myself so my 'androgynous' would be okay) has a really cute voice which is quite high for a boy and, once again sorry, is stereotypically gay. Does anyone else have a voice like this? How can I get my voice like this? I'd rather really love it :)
Finally, it seems most gay boys aren't hairy at all and have like immaculate smooth skin. I want to be like this but idk how I'd do it. Does anyone else have a hairless body, how do you get it like this?

Again, no offence, I know I've been rather supporting stereotypes here. Thanks :)

The thing is: I feel really good with it, with the doubt. I like ""feeling"" myself like something neutral. But sometimes I feel more ""girlish"" or ""boyish"".
I don't feel confortable when someone refers to me like a boy neither like a girl. This is a problem because here in Brazil we don't have a neutral article and stuff.
So, could you help me with all of this? I really don't know what I ""am"" and I'm feeling really unconfortable with this.

This all makes me emotional as all hell and I haven't had a good space to share it before, so sorry if it comes off as jumbled.

I'm 16. I was born female. I'm a lesbian, but it took me a while to come to terms with that. Only really did as of last year. I still haven't told my parents. I'm scared they'll hold it against me, and think worse of me because of it.

I don't know what gender I am. And it hurts not knowing. I dress feminine and androgynous, and I got short hair, but my mom gets critical of me when I'm not as feminine. She used the term ""dy*e-y"" when she brings it up. That hurts, so I try to avoid it. but since I was a kid I liked dressing in guy clothes. I was always a boy in school plays. I wear boxers a lot of the time, and I really like the feeling I get when I wear them. Sounds stupid, I know. 

I dress a lot to what's expected of me as female. I wear makeup. I don't feel like I look okay without it. I keep my look effeminate, mostly for my mother sake. I shave my legs if I wear a dress or shorts. I wear regular bras most the time, sometimes a sports bra, sometimes two.

I hate my breasts. I like breasts on other people, sure. But it just feels disgusting having them, it's hard to describe. I want to rip or cut them off. I wear sports bras to ail, but that just creates a pressure reminding me they're there. It just makes me feel sick and uncomfortable. I feel guilty about this. Like, if I'm female, I'm not really a woman. I'm not good enough. I should not feel this way.

I don't feel this strongly about my vagina. To put it bluntly, I really like to masturbate. But that's about the extent of it. Otherwise I don't even feel as if it's there. And when I can I just try to ignore it. I keep myself clean but it always feels dirty.

I feel like I'm not right for feeling like this. I love women, I love these things on other women. But when it's me it is wrong. And I feel like it's my fault because there's got to be something wrong with me that I feel this way. And maybe I might feel okay if I knew what I was supposed to be. 

I don't want to be a man, in the traditional sense. I find the idea of having a penis slightly erotic, but it's not who I am. But I don't like having breasts or a vagina. I know there are more options and everything between male and female but I don't know what I am. 

And it's hard and it hurts because there's just this thing in the back of my head and no matter how much I just want to feel okay I just feel wrong and broken and out of place and dirty and I don't know how to stop it and I don't want to feel like this anymore

68,2014-10-15 04:11:20,2jadpm,8,8,"So I received a very positive response to my first post here about me coming out as genderqueer. Now I will tell you about my not so easy coming out story.
I was 14 and was for sure a lesbian. All of my friends knew about it, teacher at school knew as well. I talked to my counselor about how I should come out to my parents. She was very kind in helping me figure out how I was going to tell them. At this time they were in vegas on vacation so it was just me and my two older brothers at home for two weeks. My oldest brother who is eight years older than me was the first family member I told. He was very understanding and told me he would be on my side always. We were very close after this, I told all of my deepest secrets to.
I decided to write my parents a note telling a them that I was a lesbian. I layed it on their bed the night before their arrival home because they would get home before I left for sac hook the next morning. I woke that morning completely forgetting that I had even put that note there. When I walked out into the living room my mom came unglued on me. She started screaming at me and telling me that I was sick and that I should go see a therapist. I fraught with her and cried until I felt I would throw up. She was relentless on telling me I was sick and needed proffecional help. I left for school but had my brother pick me up from school because the stress was too much and I became I'll at school an they made me go home. Unknowing to me my brother teamed my mom the short while I was gone. He was very angry with her for the way she treated me. My mother and I didn't talk for at least a week. We just avoided each other for the time being. Things started to get very bad at school with sever bullying. My life was threatened a few times by other students and I was followed into the bathroom by students as well with their motive to attack me once I was alone. A few months later I met my husband and became his girlfriend. My mom completely forgot about the note and thought I was over being a lesbian because I now had a boyfriend. What she didn't know was we were a polyamorous couple and had relations with other women. Once she found out about this she would say hurtful things to me on purpose to make me angry or cry. 
Over the past seven years I have been battleig with her on this subject. She didn't even feel like my mother anymore. I became so full of hate because of her that if she caled me just to say hi I would break down after the call and yell and scream or just crumble and cry. This made my husband hate her with every ounce of his being. I cried everyday for three years because of her and the thiga she would say to me.
Once I sea covered that I was a genderqueer I decided to tell her how I felt about her. I told her how I felt on the phone and she hug up on me. That was the day that I have up on her ad gave up on trying to get her respect and love that I so desperately wanted. It has been two weeks since I talked to her and I no longer cry or get angry because of her. I am so thankful for my husband and his amazing family to take me as I am and love me for the person I am. I am so happy with my life that I realized that I didn't need her to be happy or to feel a mothers love because my mother in law has loved me for me for almost seven years now and she has not once looked down on me for being me or liking the things that I like.
I really do believe that things do get better. Sometimes we just have to wait longer than others for it to get better. Now I am happier than I have ever been. Living as the person I always was meant to be!

69,2014-10-15 10:02:49,2jazi8,16,10,"The main purpose of this is just to write down my feelings. The secondary purpose is that I don't have a word to call myself. I know the easy thing to say is ""labels aren't important"" and I agree, they aren't, but it would be nice to at least know what to tell someone without having to explain everything. I decided on ""genderflexible"" for a while, but to my knowledge nobody else has ever used that, which defeats the purpose of using a label for the benefit of others, and besides I still don't feel 100% comfortable with that.

I'm biologically male. Very much so, even. Throughout my life I've gone by male pronouns and never felt a need to change that, but I guess the most accurate thing to say is that I've always felt... Off. Even before I knew what trans people were, I recall having momentary thoughts of wishing I was female. Never very serious, just occasional, passing thoughts. I have a lot of feminine mannerisms and I'm okay with that. I used to be afraid people would think I was gay because of it, but as I came more to terms with my sexuality, I stopped caring about that completely. I have a relatively high-pitched voice, and sometimes people think I'm female over the phone. One of the strangest things, to me at least, is that my birth name is fairly unisex, but I've never liked it, and the name I choose to go by is definitively masculine.

I'm definitely not trans. I know that for a fact. And for the longest time, I thought it was as simple as that. Recently, though, those past memories of wishing I was female have come back to me. I'm writing a novel with a transgender character as the focus, with a female narrator. When writing the section concerned with the trans character explaining his situation, I looked up various descriptions of dysphoria and amalgamated them with my own words into a coherent, comprehensive overview of what dysphoria is and how that character experiences it. Doing so was interesting for me.

Before I wrote that section, I would simply say ""I don't experience dysphoria"", but afterwards, I started thinking... I kind of do. Not to a massive level, but enough that now I'm thinking about it, it's starting to bother me.

I generally have no problem with my sex characteristics. I don't want feminine breasts or a vagina. At the same time, though, I don't know if I'd feel any different if I did have them. The thing is, though, I have a lot of body hair and a very masculine figure, and those two things bother me constantly. I wish I was physically feminine enough to simply present as androgynous, but to my knowledge there is no way to permanently prevent body hair from growing (I have, in fact, done research on this) and that is my largest obstacle.

My main problem is that none of the definitions I've seen for any of the established gender identities fits me completely. Usually hardly at all. I suppose technically I could use ""non-binary"" or ""genderqueer"" but for some reason I don't feel completely comfortable with them either, possibly related to how I'm technically pansexual but only feel comfortable calling myself bisexual. And for reasons stated above I couldn't really call myself an androgyne either. I looked at a bunch of different related subreddits before posting here, since this one seems to have the most subscribers.

What I'm looking for is basically, what am I? Is there a term for it already? Is there anyone else like me?

I don't know if I've said everything I meant to say or needed to say but I can't think of anything else so I guess that's it for now. If anyone has any questions I'll readily answer them.

**TL;DR** I don't feel comfortable with any labels I've managed to find, and even though that shouldn't bother me, it does. I'm biologically male but I wish I was more physically female, though I'm definitely not trans and would feel equally comfortable with either set of genitalia. It's kind of difficult to sum up.

Thought I'd start up a little thread so we can share some victories lately. Whatever it is, no matter how small or big, share it up! Lets get some positive stuff flowing!

I had a big win today. For the first time since I was 19 or so I went to a session with a therapist. Never before in my previous times in therapy had I gotten to discuss my gender issues (mostly for not having them formed, and other more important problems like not killing myself), and I was quite worried. I had a list of therapists that had training in gender issues in the city, but none of them were listed with my work's assistance program. If this didn't go well, I'd probably have to pay a lot out of pocket.

Fortunately, she was amazing! While not versed in gender issues she was super keen to learn. One of her daughters is bi and the other a lesbian so she has a basis in sexuality issues, but really wants to branch out into understanding gender identity issues too. I gave her a high level on a lot of different identities, explained how I felt I fit, and even sent her a copy of the genderbread person! I also put her in contact with the person who runs a gender and sexuality resource in the city, and hopefully they will talk and maybe get her some training in gender issues. Maybe form a better support network for GQ people in the city!

Although I know therapy will be hard, especially when it comes to working stuff out with my GF, I'm ecstatic to find some professional support!

So sorry if this comes out as a bunch of jumbled up words.

I am 16, and I was born Female. I have no problem with people using she/her pronouns, but I wouldn't have a problem with people using any pronouns for me either. Whether it be he/his, they/them, xe/xyr, etc. 

For most of my life I've been a bit.....different? Even in childhood I would switch between being very tomboyish, and being very girly. Although that could have been normal for every child to go through who knows. 

Now though is kinda weird, like several months ago I was very girly. I wanted to wear girly clothes, use makeup, have long hair, etc. But more recently I've been wanting really badly to be pretty androgynous. Like cutting my hair short, have more boyish clothes, and wanting to have smaller breasts. Hell, I would kill for one day waking up, and having no boobs at all.

Regarding the genitalia area though, I wouldn't really care one way or the other. Although I would think that having a vagina would be a bit more comfortable than having a penis, since you wouldn't have to worry about sitting on it.

I'm genderqueer, dfab, and prefer to look and dress mostly androgynously/masculine. I haven’t had a proper binder in a long time and dysphoria/discomfort was hitting me pretty hard. Hearing goood things about Underworks, I decided I needed a new one and ordered the Underworks 997, and by using the “measure ribs/chest and average them” method of measuring, I’m a small. A 24 to be exact, which is the last size before a Medium. If I measure like it says above the sizing chart, to just measure around the widest part of the chest, I’m a medium, about a 36.

I ended up going with the smaller one, but its WAY too small. I can hardly get it on without ending up exhausted and in pain. I can’t get it over my shoulders at all, and just barely over my hips if I step into it. From there, I can’t even get my arms through it.

After looking again, I think I might like the 988 better anyway, as it doesnt have the belly compression which would be really uncomfortable for me. The 988 is also similar to my last binder which I liked as well.

I was going to exchange the small 997 to get a medium 988 but I keep getting paranoid that it will be too big or something. The sizes are slightly different between the two. I wish there was a way to try on internet items before buying.

I looked up a ton of reviews and some people are saying its SUPPOSED to be that tight? And that it stretches with time? And a few other people are saying they needed a size bigger.

So does anyone think they can give me some advice for my situation here? I’m having trouble sleeping cus I don’t want to end up with the wrong size AGAIN and have to pay the extra $5 to exchange it a second time.

I was born female. I was always a tomboy and rather disappointed I was a girl when I was a little kid. I've always been rather androgynous (flat chest, short hair, neutral voice, long torso and built like a boy), but am just about always recognized as a girl wherever I go, predominately because I am very short and have some semblance of curves. 

Now, starting in college, I started to see myself as ""female... I guess."" I only felt that I was a girl because I was obliged to pick a gender. I never liked fitting in the femme/butch dichotomy of the queer-female community, but rather liked to wear make-up with my ties and jewelry or wear hats with my dresses. I started to see my gender as void, and would occasionally describe myself as genderqueer to my friends. 

While I enjoy blending female and masculine, I don't strongly affiliate with masculinity. Just non-femininity. She/her/hers pronouns are still okay with me, even if it feels a bit off. I feel weird being called by my rather girly first name, and always enjoyed when my friends called me by my gender-neutral nickname. From this, I started to think that I am genderqueer. It feels right to me.

But I still pass as cisgender, I'm still okay with being seen as a woman/female/girl. I'm not aggressive about what I feel is my genderqueerness, and I don't feel that I necessarily want to. 

So, what I think I'm trying to say is that I don't want to claim an identity if I can't rightly own it.

98,2014-10-19 20:02:08,2jpv23,1,7,"Hi everyone. Not a native speaker here.

I am a bisexual AFAB and really really questioning my gender. I'am 25 years old and have been questioning my gender for about 13-14 years but I don't feel legitimate and am afraid of coming out as non binary and end up identifying as a ciswoman again later.

I don't feel legitimate for many reasons:

1) When I was a child, I didn't question my gender, I actually didn't want people to believe I was a boy despite not wanting to be seen as girly. I only started to question my gender once I hit puberty.
2) I grew up being quite misogynistic, I think I'm no longer a misogynist, but how could I be sure about that?
3) Sometimes, I feel confortable the way I am. At least, now that I am older, I'm starting to feel more confortable with myself.
4) I used to wear / want to wear boy clothes, but now I just like using both feminine and masculine codes and I really want to see clothes as neutral though sometimes I am expressing something about myself through these codes... it's just cultural...
5) No issue with my genitals, I've always been totally ok with them.
6) I don't want to take hormones.

A few issues I've had with myself which happened at the same time as my gender questioning:

1) I really hated having breasts, I felt truly inconfortable having them since they first appeared on my body and wanted to have them remove. I'm terribly phobic of anything medical so I didn't, but I still don't really like them, I just feel like I had to learn not to mind them.
I remember wanting to buy smaller sized bras to bind my chest and since I've learned about binders on tumblr, I actually feel like getting one.
It's was really hard for me to hear all my AFAB friends loving their breasts, wanting bigger breasts when the only times I felt good about my chest were when I was dreaming of being almost flat-chested or completely flat-chested.
Most people told me it was part of going through puberty or just plain self-hatred, I only started to learn to ignore them when I turned 21.

2) Actually, when I turned 21, I spent 4 months using a male name online even with my friends, I still use this name, I feel myself with this name though I don't mind my given name that much. I feel like it has helped me accepting myself, being myself. But is it truly about my gender? Also, I am not a man.

3) While I feel confortable with myself most of the time now, I often find myself crying or feeling depressed about being a woman... not because society is rather unfair to women but because it does not feel right and I feel like part of my identity is being ignored.

4) I ""suffer from"" mild/medium hirsutism. I used to hate myself for that because people would laugh at me, now I feel like it's really important, that not looking like what people expect from women makes me be myself. I still shave my facial hair though, because I don't want to remain unemployed. 

Yet, I really don't want to come out as non binary and be a massive fraud. I already feel like I'm a fraud to bisexual/polysexual people most of the time. But what if I spend most of my life feeling bad being a ciswoman because it just seems easier?

It's the first time I speak openly about that, I really hope I'm not being offensive because I feel silly.

but what do you think about this? 
do you think trans people are still getting the short end of the stick? 
are things changing for the better or well trans people get left in the dust as more republicans become blasé about gay marriage?
is the connection between T and LGB communities reinforcing the assumption that sexuality and gender are the same thing? 
do you think lgb progress is slowed by attempts to include trans people?

Basically, my fiance and I are what you could call fairly androgynous on a day to day life basis. Neither of us fits very well with our biological sex, but we don't identify as anything other than our biological sex.

He admitted me to me one day, fairly shortly after we started dating, that he often cross-dresses for both sexual and non-sexual reasons. I found this to be a great time to admit to him that I regularly fantasize about having a male body and being with a woman, myself. And other times, for non-sexual reasons, I too sometimes imagine I'm a guy. 

So needless to say, we often (but not always, mind you) swap gender roles when having fun in the bedroom. I'll dress up like a man, he'll dress up like a woman, complete with breastforms that we both excitedly ordered together. 

First of all, I want to say how lucky I am to have him, because honestly there can't be many people out there who would accept this or participate in this, never mind be basically the same as me except with a different biological sex. 

But, I have to ask, what is this exactly? Is this genderqueer? It can't just be a fetish because we'll do these things in non-sexual situations, too. Sometimes I'll just *feel* like a male, and sometimes he tells me he just *feels* like a female. But then we can be our biological roles, or just sort of androgynous tends to be our usual mode. 

Anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? I'm not concerned, but it makes me wonder, and I mean, I'd love to know what is going on here. Especially if it means meeting more people like us to become friends with, etc.

I'm biologically female, and for the most part, I'm perfectly fine with that. I've always been the ""one of the guys"" kinds of girls, but that never bothered me or gave me any reason to doubt myself. The older I got, the more into my teen years, the more uncomfortable I became with the notion of my own sexuality, but once again, it was something I just adjusted to. I never felt much like a girl. It felt almost like a game I was playing, a fun, wacky thing to do to dress up and act feminine.

I didn't really start having serious issues until a little over three years ago when I found out I was pregnant. I started seeing things about pregnancy and motherhood in a new light, but not the way that you would expect. I didn't get it, it didn't feel like ""me"". It's not something I've ever identified with and I struggle to even accept that it's capable of happening to me. Even now, years later, I don't internalize myself as my daughter's ""mom"". I'm her ""parent"". 

I've tried to talk about this to people in the past, and they don't understand that I'm just fine with being female, I just don't always feel like a girl. Up until a year or so ago I had no idea that there were any options besides being cis-gendered or trans, and I'm sure most people don't, either. My fiance is the first person that I've fully opened up to about it, and I truly feel like he gets it more than most people.

I have the hardest time explaining this, and I feel like I haven't really explained much of anything. While being traditionally and biologically female is fun to me, it's not something I always identify with. When people make jokes about me being a mother or a girlfriend, a lot of times it causes me a lot of distress because I don't identify with the concepts they're presenting to me. Most people say I'm just a hardcore feminist and don't like the way women are treated, but it's so much deeper than that. It's a fear and a severe emotional discomfort associated with having feminine ideas attributed to me at times when I don't feel feminine. 

I've thought about what it would be like if I were a man more times than I can count. I've thought about dressing up and I've wondered what I would look like if I were more classically masculine. While androgyny is something that is somewhat appealing, I just love so much about each of the traditional binary genders. I love dressing up, but I feel like I'm missing out on an entire tangent of ways to express myself.

The main question I have is that, if there is something different about me, if I'm able to identify as something other than female, does it matter? If I'm okay with my biological sex, is it worth opening myself up to criticism? I live in a very uncultured area, and I seriously worry about what it would mean for me and my family if I decided I was anything other than a female woman.

This is the first time I've described this issue to this extent, and my heart is racing. I hope this makes sense to people. I really need any kind of advice you can give. :(

2,2014-10-02 01:36:27,2i1tqd,15,12,"I've been bashing my head against this subject for about two weeks now, and I've finally come to the point where I just don't know what's up or down.

I need help

I'm an 18 year-old male (term used loosely here) interested in females. I had a plenty boyish childhood. Batman, power rangers, vidya games, etc. According to my parents, I never exhibited any signs of transsexuality except for one whole summer where I wore nothing but a pink dress (I was riding that hype train HARD.) I don't really remember if I held any notable interests in girl toys; I vaguely recall /wanting/ to play with my sister's barbie house, but I definitely don't remember it materializing into anything. Nothing really significant that I remember, basically. 

Growing up, I was pretty feminine, though. I didn't like sports or have any real desire to play them despite my dad's persistent encouragement to do so. I didn't like the idea of being strong, masculine, or really anything that might result in such. It absolutely repulses me now. Probably the most notable of my friendships growing up were my two female friends, not that I could make any other friends anyway. Now that I think of it, I don't think I've ever intentionally befriended a male. And even if I did, the very act of inviting them over seemed hellish. I felt like I didn't know what to do or what they'd want to do, so I generally avoided stuff like that. I did like hanging out in groups, though; the reason, I imagine, is that I could just play along until I could leave without insulting the host. I never had that problem with girls, though. 

I wouldn't say I developed a conscious desire to be female until about age 15 or 16. I began fantasizing about the idea of being a female, which always took me away from my studies, social interactions, and generally occupied my mind more than anything else. I had a lot of sexual fantasies as a female in a heterosexual relationship. I had a lot of fantasies which consisted of just /being female/. It got to the point where I would actually crack a smile as if it provided me with some sort of elation. I thought a lot about waking up in a world where I was female and had always been so, which, invariably, seemed worlds better than living as a male.

I'd just take all of that (as well as some other stuff I'm not going to mention here) as 'good enough' evidence for being transsexual, but I'm having trouble with one thing.

The Dysphoria.

I can't say I've ever experienced what a lot of transsexuals have purportedly experienced at the level they have. I've never really liked having a penis (erections suck, especially because I naturally sit to pee), but it hasn't been until recently that I've seen it as *vaguely* foreign. I've had the same issue with my chest, too. I haven't really had an issue with not having breasts until, just a few weeks ago, I lifted up my arms to stretch after showering, noticed my chest, and could just see breasts. I stayed like that, frozen, for about a minute, just looking. I couldn't wrap my head around it. Ever since, I can't stop noticing that my genitals seem like they're separate from the rest of my body and that I /should/ have breasts. Body hair, too, hasn't been an issue at all, and I'd be hard pressed to say that it's a real issue now. I did a full-body shave recently and just LOVE smoothness. I have zero desire to go back to not trimming body hair, but, then again, I think I /could/ live with not shaving religiously in a world where I don't transition.

My main concern coming out of this is what if I'm just tricking myself into thinking I'm trans? I really, really do want to be a woman. That is something I'm confident in saying. I at least /think/ I want breasts, a vagina, a smaller waist, wider hips, longer hair, etc. But what if the slight physical dysphoria is all manufactured out of my head and is just validating some transtrender mentality? I pose a lot in front of the mirror, expecting to find curvier physique, plumper lips, longer hair that I could style, etc. but is that necessarily transsexualism? Am I just a really, really feminine man? Note: I never do that kind of stuff out in public. I rarely talk in a feminine voice, walk in a feminine way (I kind of tend to swing my ass), any of that stuff when around my heterocissexual friends. I just get really scared of what they'll think.

Sorry that this is probably so shitty and poorly worded/written. I probably left out a lot of important details. I have really poor organizational abilities and get a little too lazy to spend more than an hour writing.

Please help. I'll be trying on my first dress tomorrow. (haven't had the opportunity since I really decided to begin the early stages of my transtion, I moved away from my house and don't have access to women's clothing.)

I'm out to my gf. 


  Wednesday she saw an email in my inbox from a local sexuality/gender support place I went to for help and asked the question over text, plainly, ""Do you think you're trans?"" I tried to say I wanted to discuss it in person, but she pushed. So, I told her.

Quickly, things went south.

We both came home from work to discuss it. She knew something was up. She thought at first maybe I had been cheating on her. In fact, I think she was more hoping that would be the case. When she said that she didn't want me ""working on being more feminine"" she had a inkling of what was up, and said it on purpose, because she didn't want it to be true.


As I explained my identity and what I feel I need to do, she said she understood yet she didn't. She doesn't understand the space I inhabit between genders. Be a man or be a woman, but don't be something in between. She doesn't understand why I want to look more androgynous than I do already. She's worried that I'll want to grow a beard and wear a dress. I'm not into genderfuck, I just want to dress how I feel. Present how I feel.


She went back and forth, from confused to angry to hurt and around again. She said we should break up. She feels lost in this relationship, and she's lost herself too. The space will give us both time to find ourselves, and if that brings us back together then it does. I said I wanted to walk this together. To grow together. To use this to strengthen each other. I guess that's not her thought. Maybe this has been coming for a long time. Maybe she was just waiting for a reason and I served one up on a silver platter. We had some tough spots before, but I thought that things may have been coming around. Perhaps some things are to big to handle. 


We got drunk that night. Rather, she got hammered and I had a few to take the edge off. As things dragged into the night, and the topic abandoned in inebriation, all that was left in my heart was a feeling of devastation. 


It's day 2, and I'm trying not to beat myself up. I know I shouldn't, its not healthy and not my fault. Still a vicious battle rages in my head between doing what I need to confront aspects of myself that have lingered for so long against losing the woman that I love in doing so. I try to tell myself that it's for the best, that brighter things await me, but the heartache I feel gnaws at my ribs, snapping me back, reminding me of where I am.


In this time, we haven't really said more than a few words to each other. Yesterday she was hung over and spent the day in bed. [I went and got a tattoo](http://imgur.com/ivlzAbo) that I had been planning on getting for awhile, but now seems all the more appropriate (right, /u/Parkertron?). Today again she's staying home. I still hope against hope that she comes around, but I don't know how foolish those dreams may be.


When leaving to get the tattoo and leaving for work today, both times I've said ""I love you"", as I've always done before going anywhere. That way if anything if happened to me and I didn't make it back, they would be the last words she'd hear me say. Both times, as she's laid there and didn't respond, it was all I could do not to collapse in tears.


I'm sorry again, for the downer post and for the wall of text. I figured some would wonder how it'd all turn out. I'm really not certain myself how it will. All I can do is go on, and like my tattoo says, *this too shall pass.*

10,2014-10-03 22:44:56,2i8bjg,30,4,"Warning: offensive wall of text **now edited to correct ignorance and hate-mongering**

tl;dr: I feel that gender fluidity (edit: genderqueer) sabotages legitimate transgender progress. 
Edit: I acknowledge that everyone on the LGBT/GRSM spectrum faces difficulty, especially those stuck somewhere in the middle. It wasn't fair of me to pin my frustrations with the trans struggle on the entirety of a group with even less recognition and legitimization. 

I consider myself a pretty liberal person. I'm a pansexual cis-female and my boyfriend is a heterosexual trans-man. I've been with him since he was in the closet as a lesbian and was the first person to ask if he identified as male. Seeing his pain and struggle to become the physical manifestation of his true identity has been both inspiring and infuriating. Helping him through the insane dysphasia, the pronoun and name swap, the education of the close-minded and ignorant, and his journey of medically and legally earning his gender has really shaped my opinion and solidified my support of the lgbT (emphasis on T) community.

I cannot stand the whole gender-fluid (edit: genderqueer) thing.

(edit: Being genderqueer is no more a choice than being trans is in many cases, and even if it is, there honestly is nothing wrong with that.) It becomes wrong when it has consequences like no one taking my boyfriend seriously until his 3rd hospitalization for suicide attempt, the first of which was in 6th grade. (edit: This is not the fault of the GQ community and many genderqueer folks have had similar struggles.) It makes light of a life-or-death circumstance. (edit: Nope.)

On a different, more personal note, I think the invention of genderless pronouns is idiotic. I understand that language is fluid, but getting all huffy when someone uses a word in the dictionary as opposed to your made-up special-snowflake word is just pathetic in my eyes.

So, for those of you who are androgyne, agender, neutrois, and other neutral genders, how would you explain to someone what it means to be neither man nor woman?  Assume a clueless but non-hostile audience.

My strategy, such as it is, is to appeal to the somewhat unchanging center of personal identity.  That place from which ""man"" or ""woman"" so easily arises is cisgendered people (avoiding the confusing term).  And then to explain that I got ""neither"" from that place.  I'm trying to avoid leaning on stereotype explanations, because whether they know it or not, that is a mess of clarifications, contradictions, counterexamples, and *bleah*.

*update* Here's a dual-narrative approach that I'm settling on (edited for brevity and to remove personal details).  I'm going to sit on it for a few days before sending the letter off, but this may be useful to others.

&gt; Take everything that you associate with masculinity and put it into a metaphorical yard.  Then do the same thing with everything feminine, putting all of that into an adjacent yard.  Then, build a low stone wall (not a fence) between them, and put atop this wall everything that you can associate with both genders.  Then, imagine that I walked down that wall, picked up a lot of the attributes from that center place, and then the parts from both of the yards that most appealed to me.

And then there's this section, which I'm going to chop out so I can think about it more.

~~Ask yourself whether you are a man or a woman.  Once you get the answer, search for who gave you the answer.  Try to track it backwards to the source inside you that knows which gender you are.  Try to figure out what the term even means and whether it would still have a meaning if you stripped away all of the stereotypes?  I assume that your answer to the question is instant, absolutely certain, and completely immutable.  That it originates from some deep center of self, a place where there is no questioning, there is simply a full knowledge that this is true, and that your experience is as certain as is your experience of the color blue.~~

~~The answer I get back is ""neither"".  Complete negation leaves an unsatisfying void, and Androgyne fills the void rather nicely.  Nicely enough that while new words that may be more accurate have been coined, I have stuck with this word for a decade.~~

Hi!

So, I'm genderqueer and mainly feel I'm gender neutral so I looked online at gender neutral outfits and most see, to be all black and geared more towards the male side of things. I was speaking to someone else who gender fluid and she was saying that she dressing neutrally and has her hair short and most people think she's a lesbian. That's when I was an epiphany, why don't I try dress like a gay guy, think Tyler Oakley kinda thing. Anyway, I was wondering (and like I said not meaning to support stereotypes) if any of you gay people dress in typical gay fashion (brighter clothes etc) and why you do this? I would be a great help and encouragement if you could suggest ways I can be more feminine or the kinda clothes I could wear to achieve a Tyler Oakley kinda gay look? It would be like my own interpretation on androgynous.

Also, the boy at my school who I have a crush on (I'm actually pretty gay myself so my 'androgynous' would be okay) has a really cute voice which is quite high for a boy and, once again sorry, is stereotypically gay.

With all the FB posts happening I knew my husband would say something eventually (he can be a little tone def sometimes). I wasn't expecting the fight/argument we had. It took me a little while to figure out why I was so upset, and once that can was open I was kinda cornered into coming out to him. It was so scary! I didn't want to be rejected, or for him to think differently about me.
Turns out I shouldn't have worried, he was completely accepting. He was a little hurt that I felt I wasn't able to say something sooner, and he also apologized for saying some insensitive things in the past. 
He still doesn't completely understand what being genderqueer means, the words and the community and ect, but he wants to learn about that side of me.

This all makes me emotional as all hell and I haven't had a good space to share it before, so sorry if it comes off as jumbled.

I'm 16. I was born female. I'm a lesbian, but it took me a while to come to terms with that. Only really did as of last year. I still haven't told my parents. I'm scared they'll hold it against me, and think worse of me because of it.

I don't know what gender I am. And it hurts not knowing. I dress feminine and androgynous, and I got short hair, but my mom gets critical of me when I'm not as feminine. She used the term ""dy*e-y"" when she brings it up. That hurts, so I try to avoid it. but since I was a kid I liked dressing in guy clothes. I was always a boy in school plays. I wear boxers a lot of the time, and I really like the feeling I get when I wear them. Sounds stupid, I know. 

I dress a lot to what's expected of me as female. I wear makeup. I don't feel like I look okay without it. I keep my look effeminate, mostly for my mother sake. I shave my legs if I wear a dress or shorts. I wear regular bras most the time, sometimes a sports bra, sometimes two.

I hate my breasts. I like breasts on other people, sure. But it just feels disgusting having them, it's hard to describe. I want to rip or cut them off. I wear sports bras to ail, but that just creates a pressure reminding me they're there. It just makes me feel sick and uncomfortable. I feel guilty about this. Like, if I'm female, I'm not really a woman. I'm not good enough. I should not feel this way.

I don't feel this strongly about my vagina. To put it bluntly, I really like to masturbate. But that's about the extent of it. Otherwise I don't even feel as if it's there. And when I can I just try to ignore it. I keep myself clean but it always feels dirty.

I feel like I'm not right for feeling like this. I love women, I love these things on other women. But when it's me it is wrong. And I feel like it's my fault because there's got to be something wrong with me that I feel this way. And maybe I might feel okay if I knew what I was supposed to be. 

I don't want to be a man, in the traditional sense. I find the idea of having a penis slightly erotic, but it's not who I am. But I don't like having breasts or a vagina. I know there are more options and everything between male and female but I don't know what I am. 

And it's hard and it hurts because there's just this thing in the back of my head and no matter how much I just want to feel okay I just feel wrong and broken and out of place and dirty and I don't know how to stop it and I don't want to feel like this anymore

88,2014-10-15 04:11:20,2jadpm,8,8,"So I received a very positive response to my first post here about me coming out as genderqueer. Now I will tell you about my not so easy coming out story.
I was 14 and was for sure a lesbian. All of my friends knew about it, teacher at school knew as well. I talked to my counselor about how I should come out to my parents. She was very kind in helping me figure out how I was going to tell them. At this time they were in vegas on vacation so it was just me and my two older brothers at home for two weeks. My oldest brother who is eight years older than me was the first family member I told. He was very understanding and told me he would be on my side always. We were very close after this, I told all of my deepest secrets to.
I decided to write my parents a note telling a them that I was a lesbian. I layed it on their bed the night before their arrival home because they would get home before I left for sac hook the next morning. I woke that morning completely forgetting that I had even put that note there. When I walked out into the living room my mom came unglued on me. She started screaming at me and telling me that I was sick and that I should go see a therapist. I fraught with her and cried until I felt I would throw up. She was relentless on telling me I was sick and needed proffecional help. I left for school but had my brother pick me up from school because the stress was too much and I became I'll at school an they made me go home. Unknowing to me my brother teamed my mom the short while I was gone. He was very angry with her for the way she treated me. My mother and I didn't talk for at least a week. We just avoided each other for the time being. Things started to get very bad at school with sever bullying. My life was threatened a few times by other students and I was followed into the bathroom by students as well with their motive to attack me once I was alone. A few months later I met my husband and became his girlfriend. My mom completely forgot about the note and thought I was over being a lesbian because I now had a boyfriend. What she didn't know was we were a polyamorous couple and had relations with other women. Once she found out about this she would say hurtful things to me on purpose to make me angry or cry. 
Over the past seven years I have been battleig with her on this subject. She didn't even feel like my mother anymore. I became so full of hate because of her that if she caled me just to say hi I would break down after the call and yell and scream or just crumble and cry. This made my husband hate her with every ounce of his being. I cried everyday for three years because of her and the thiga she would say to me.
Once I sea covered that I was a genderqueer I decided to tell her how I felt about her. I told her how I felt on the phone and she hug up on me. That was the day that I have up on her ad gave up on trying to get her respect and love that I so desperately wanted. It has been two weeks since I talked to her and I no longer cry or get angry because of her. I am so thankful for my husband and his amazing family to take me as I am and love me for the person I am. I am so happy with my life that I realized that I didn't need her to be happy or to feel a mothers love because my mother in law has loved me for me for almost seven years now and she has not once looked down on me for being me or liking the things that I like.
I really do believe that things do get better. Sometimes we just have to wait longer than others for it to get better. Now I am happier than I have ever been. Living as the person I always was meant to be!

89,2014-10-15 10:02:49,2jazi8,16,10,"The main purpose of this is just to write down my feelings. The secondary purpose is that I don't have a word to call myself. I know the easy thing to say is ""labels aren't important"" and I agree, they aren't, but it would be nice to at least know what to tell someone without having to explain everything. I decided on ""genderflexible"" for a while, but to my knowledge nobody else has ever used that, which defeats the purpose of using a label for the benefit of others, and besides I still don't feel 100% comfortable with that.

I'm biologically male. Very much so, even. Throughout my life I've gone by male pronouns and never felt a need to change that, but I guess the most accurate thing to say is that I've always felt... Off. Even before I knew what trans people were, I recall having momentary thoughts of wishing I was female. Never very serious, just occasional, passing thoughts. I have a lot of feminine mannerisms and I'm okay with that. I used to be afraid people would think I was gay because of it, but as I came more to terms with my sexuality, I stopped caring about that completely. I have a relatively high-pitched voice, and sometimes people think I'm female over the phone. One of the strangest things, to me at least, is that my birth name is fairly unisex, but I've never liked it, and the name I choose to go by is definitively masculine.

I'm definitely not trans. I know that for a fact. And for the longest time, I thought it was as simple as that. Recently, though, those past memories of wishing I was female have come back to me. I'm writing a novel with a transgender character as the focus, with a female narrator. When writing the section concerned with the trans character explaining his situation, I looked up various descriptions of dysphoria and amalgamated them with my own words into a coherent, comprehensive overview of what dysphoria is and how that character experiences it. Doing so was interesting for me.

Before I wrote that section, I would simply say ""I don't experience dysphoria"", but afterwards, I started thinking... I kind of do. Not to a massive level, but enough that now I'm thinking about it, it's starting to bother me.

I generally have no problem with my sex characteristics. I don't want feminine breasts or a vagina. At the same time, though, I don't know if I'd feel any different if I did have them. The thing is, though, I have a lot of body hair and a very masculine figure, and those two things bother me constantly. I wish I was physically feminine enough to simply present as androgynous, but to my knowledge there is no way to permanently prevent body hair from growing (I have, in fact, done research on this) and that is my largest obstacle.

My main problem is that none of the definitions I've seen for any of the established gender identities fits me completely. Usually hardly at all. I suppose technically I could use ""non-binary"" or ""genderqueer"" but for some reason I don't feel completely comfortable with them either, possibly related to how I'm technically pansexual but only feel comfortable calling myself bisexual. And for reasons stated above I couldn't really call myself an androgyne either. I looked at a bunch of different related subreddits before posting here, since this one seems to have the most subscribers.

What I'm looking for is basically, what am I? Is there a term for it already? Is there anyone else like me?

I don't know if I've said everything I meant to say or needed to say but I can't think of anything else so I guess that's it for now. If anyone has any questions I'll readily answer them.

**TL;DR** I don't feel comfortable with any labels I've managed to find, and even though that shouldn't bother me, it does. I'm biologically male but I wish I was more physically female, though I'm definitely not trans and would feel equally comfortable with either set of genitalia. It's kind of difficult to sum up.

Thought I'd start up a little thread so we can share some victories lately. Whatever it is, no matter how small or big, share it up! Lets get some positive stuff flowing!

I had a big win today. For the first time since I was 19 or so I went to a session with a therapist. Never before in my previous times in therapy had I gotten to discuss my gender issues (mostly for not having them formed, and other more important problems like not killing myself), and I was quite worried. I had a list of therapists that had training in gender issues in the city, but none of them were listed with my work's assistance program. If this didn't go well, I'd probably have to pay a lot out of pocket.

Fortunately, she was amazing! While not versed in gender issues she was super keen to learn. One of her daughters is bi and the other a lesbian so she has a basis in sexuality issues, but really wants to branch out into understanding gender identity issues too. I gave her a high level on a lot of different identities, explained how I felt I fit, and even sent her a copy of the genderbread person! I also put her in contact with the person who runs a gender and sexuality resource in the city, and hopefully they will talk and maybe get her some training in gender issues. Maybe form a better support network for GQ people in the city!

Although I know therapy will be hard, especially when it comes to working stuff out with my GF, I'm ecstatic to find some professional support!

I'm genderqueer, dfab, and prefer to look and dress mostly androgynously/masculine. I haven’t had a proper binder in a long time and dysphoria/discomfort was hitting me pretty hard. Hearing goood things about Underworks, I decided I needed a new one and ordered the Underworks 997, and by using the “measure ribs/chest and average them” method of measuring, I’m a small. A 24 to be exact, which is the last size before a Medium. If I measure like it says above the sizing chart, to just measure around the widest part of the chest, I’m a medium, about a 36.

I ended up going with the smaller one, but its WAY too small. I can hardly get it on without ending up exhausted and in pain. I can’t get it over my shoulders at all, and just barely over my hips if I step into it. From there, I can’t even get my arms through it.

After looking again, I think I might like the 988 better anyway, as it doesnt have the belly compression which would be really uncomfortable for me. The 988 is also similar to my last binder which I liked as well.

I was going to exchange the small 997 to get a medium 988 but I keep getting paranoid that it will be too big or something. The sizes are slightly different between the two. I wish there was a way to try on internet items before buying.

I looked up a ton of reviews and some people are saying its SUPPOSED to be that tight? And that it stretches with time? And a few other people are saying they needed a size bigger.

So does anyone think they can give me some advice for my situation here? I’m having trouble sleeping cus I don’t want to end up with the wrong size AGAIN and have to pay the extra $5 to exchange it a second time.

I can hardly get it on without ending up exhausted and in pain. I can’t get it over my shoulders at all, and just barely over my hips if I step into it. From there, I can’t even get my arms through it.\n\nAfter looking again, I think I might like the 988 better anyway, as it doesnt have the belly compression which would be really uncomfortable for me. The 988 is also similar to my last binder which I liked as well.\n\nI was going to exchange the small 997 to get a medium 988 but I keep getting paranoid that it will be too big or something. The sizes are slightly different between the two. I wish there was a way to try on internet items before buying.\n\nI looked up a ton of reviews and some people are saying its SUPPOSED to be that tight? And that it stretches with time? And a few other people are saying they needed a size bigger.\n\nSo does anyone think they can give me some advice for my situation here? I’m having trouble sleeping cus I don’t want to end up with the wrong size AGAIN and have to pay the extra $5 to exchange it a second time.\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Binder help?', 'created': 1413555100.0}",82.0

I've always been rather androgynous (flat chest, short hair, neutral voice, long torso and built like a boy), but am just about always recognized as a girl wherever I go, predominately because I am very short and have some semblance of curves.

123,2014-10-19 20:02:08,2jpv23,1,7,"Hi everyone. Not a native speaker here.

I am a bisexual AFAB and really really questioning my gender. I'am 25 years old and have been questioning my gender for about 13-14 years but I don't feel legitimate and am afraid of coming out as non binary and end up identifying as a ciswoman again later.

I don't feel legitimate for many reasons:

1) When I was a child, I didn't question my gender, I actually didn't want people to believe I was a boy despite not wanting to be seen as girly. I only started to question my gender once I hit puberty.
2) I grew up being quite misogynistic, I think I'm no longer a misogynist, but how could I be sure about that?
3) Sometimes, I feel confortable the way I am. At least, now that I am older, I'm starting to feel more confortable with myself.
4) I used to wear / want to wear boy clothes, but now I just like using both feminine and masculine codes and I really want to see clothes as neutral though sometimes I am expressing something about myself through these codes... it's just cultural...
5) No issue with my genitals, I've always been totally ok with them.
6) I don't want to take hormones.

A few issues I've had with myself which happened at the same time as my gender questioning:

1) I really hated having breasts, I felt truly inconfortable having them since they first appeared on my body and wanted to have them remove. I'm terribly phobic of anything medical so I didn't, but I still don't really like them, I just feel like I had to learn not to mind them.
I remember wanting to buy smaller sized bras to bind my chest and since I've learned about binders on tumblr, I actually feel like getting one.
It's was really hard for me to hear all my AFAB friends loving their breasts, wanting bigger breasts when the only times I felt good about my chest were when I was dreaming of being almost flat-chested or completely flat-chested.
Most people told me it was part of going through puberty or just plain self-hatred, I only started to learn to ignore them when I turned 21.

2) Actually, when I turned 21, I spent 4 months using a male name online even with my friends, I still use this name, I feel myself with this name though I don't mind my given name that much. I feel like it has helped me accepting myself, being myself. But is it truly about my gender? Also, I am not a man.

3) While I feel confortable with myself most of the time now, I often find myself crying or feeling depressed about being a woman... not because society is rather unfair to women but because it does not feel right and I feel like part of my identity is being ignored.

4) I ""suffer from"" mild/medium hirsutism. I used to hate myself for that because people would laugh at me, now I feel like it's really important, that not looking like what people expect from women makes me be myself. I still shave my facial hair though, because I don't want to remain unemployed. 

Yet, I really don't want to come out as non binary and be a massive fraud. I already feel like I'm a fraud to bisexual/polysexual people most of the time. But what if I spend most of my life feeling bad being a ciswoman because it just seems easier?

It's the first time I speak openly about that, I really hope I'm not being offensive because I feel silly.

I\'m terribly phobic of anything medical so I didn\'t, but I still don\'t really like them, I just feel like I had to learn not to mind them.\nI remember wanting to buy smaller sized bras to bind my chest and since I\'ve learned about binders on tumblr, I actually feel like getting one.\nIt\'s was really hard for me to hear all my AFAB friends loving their breasts, wanting bigger breasts when the only times I felt good about my chest were when I was dreaming of being almost flat-chested or completely flat-chested.\nMost people told me it was part of going through puberty or just plain self-hatred, I only started to learn to ignore them when I turned 21.\n\n2) Actually, when I turned 21, I spent 4 months using a male name online even with my friends, I still use this name, I feel myself with this name though I don\'t mind my given name that much. I feel like it has helped me accepting myself, being myself. But is it truly about my gender? Also, I am not a man.\n\n3) While I feel confortable with myself most of the time now, I often find myself crying or feeling depressed about being a woman... not because society is rather unfair to women but because it does not feel right and I feel like part of my identity is being ignored.\n\n4) I ""suffer from"" mild/medium hirsutism. I used to hate myself for that because people would laugh at me, now I feel like it\'s really important, that not looking like what people expect from women makes me be myself. I still shave my facial hair though, because I don\'t want to remain unemployed. \n\nYet, I really don\'t want to come out as non binary and be a massive fraud. I already feel like I\'m a fraud to bisexual/polysexual people most of the time. But what if I spend most of my life feeling bad being a ciswoman because it just seems easier?\n\nIt\'s the first time I speak openly about that, I really hope I\'m not being offensive because I feel silly.

I've always been a little genderqueer, ever since I was a kid. When I was about 20, I cut my hair really short and I noticed something interesting. I started wearing dresses and makeup. As my hair started growing out, I'd stop wearing makeup and switch back to trousers. This was never a conscious decision, and I found it kind of interesting/amusing when I figured it out.

Anyway, now I'm 32, I grew my hair out a couple of years ago (just down to my shoulders), and I've been wearing jeans and no makeup.

I went to my school's LGBT Pride club today and was around a lot of really cool genderqueer and trans kids and they all pass and rock a totally great androgynous look with their short rad hair and ambiguous clothing.
I'm not officially out, I might as well be but I haven't done anything official about it.

Basically, my fiance and I are what you could call fairly androgynous on a day to day life basis. Neither of us fits very well with our biological sex, but we don't identify as anything other than our biological sex.

He admitted me to me one day, fairly shortly after we started dating, that he often cross-dresses for both sexual and non-sexual reasons. I found this to be a great time to admit to him that I regularly fantasize about having a male body and being with a woman, myself. And other times, for non-sexual reasons, I too sometimes imagine I'm a guy. 

So needless to say, we often (but not always, mind you) swap gender roles when having fun in the bedroom. I'll dress up like a man, he'll dress up like a woman, complete with breastforms that we both excitedly ordered together. 

First of all, I want to say how lucky I am to have him, because honestly there can't be many people out there who would accept this or participate in this, never mind be basically the same as me except with a different biological sex. 

But, I have to ask, what is this exactly? Is this genderqueer? It can't just be a fetish because we'll do these things in non-sexual situations, too. Sometimes I'll just *feel* like a male, and sometimes he tells me he just *feels* like a female. But then we can be our biological roles, or just sort of androgynous tends to be our usual mode. 

Anyone have any ideas? Suggestions? I'm not concerned, but it makes me wonder, and I mean, I'd love to know what is going on here. Especially if it means meeting more people like us to become friends with, etc.

I'm biologically female, and for the most part, I'm perfectly fine with that. I've always been the ""one of the guys"" kinds of girls, but that never bothered me or gave me any reason to doubt myself. The older I got, the more into my teen years, the more uncomfortable I became with the notion of my own sexuality, but once again, it was something I just adjusted to. I never felt much like a girl. It felt almost like a game I was playing, a fun, wacky thing to do to dress up and act feminine.

I didn't really start having serious issues until a little over three years ago when I found out I was pregnant. I started seeing things about pregnancy and motherhood in a new light, but not the way that you would expect. I didn't get it, it didn't feel like ""me"". It's not something I've ever identified with and I struggle to even accept that it's capable of happening to me. Even now, years later, I don't internalize myself as my daughter's ""mom"". I'm her ""parent"". 

I've tried to talk about this to people in the past, and they don't understand that I'm just fine with being female, I just don't always feel like a girl. Up until a year or so ago I had no idea that there were any options besides being cis-gendered or trans, and I'm sure most people don't, either. My fiance is the first person that I've fully opened up to about it, and I truly feel like he gets it more than most people.

I have the hardest time explaining this, and I feel like I haven't really explained much of anything. While being traditionally and biologically female is fun to me, it's not something I always identify with. When people make jokes about me being a mother or a girlfriend, a lot of times it causes me a lot of distress because I don't identify with the concepts they're presenting to me. Most people say I'm just a hardcore feminist and don't like the way women are treated, but it's so much deeper than that. It's a fear and a severe emotional discomfort associated with having feminine ideas attributed to me at times when I don't feel feminine. 

I've thought about what it would be like if I were a man more times than I can count. I've thought about dressing up and I've wondered what I would look like if I were more classically masculine. While androgyny is something that is somewhat appealing, I just love so much about each of the traditional binary genders. I love dressing up, but I feel like I'm missing out on an entire tangent of ways to express myself.

The main question I have is that, if there is something different about me, if I'm able to identify as something other than female, does it matter? If I'm okay with my biological sex, is it worth opening myself up to criticism? I live in a very uncultured area, and I seriously worry about what it would mean for me and my family if I decided I was anything other than a female woman.

This is the first time I've described this issue to this extent, and my heart is racing. I hope this makes sense to people. I really need any kind of advice you can give. :(
