1,2014-01-03 14:51:39,1ubaan,23,27,"Public bathrooms have always made me nervous.  I am a biological female, but I am very very androgynous.  When I was young, I would just completely avoid using the bathroom as long as I could to avoid being stared at or questioned.
These days it's a lot easier for me, But I do find myself trying to push my boobs out a little as I walk into public women's restrooms.

A few days ago I took two flights from NM to Portland, OR.  Normally I just keep to myself and avoid talking to people (because I'm shy, not ashamed) but this time was different.  I had bought a cowboy hat in NM and the only way to get it back was to wear it on the flights back.  This little addition seemed to have a big effect on how I was perceived.  No one even questioned if I was male or female.  I was assumed to be a boy under the age of 18 (I'm 25 and very short).

At the first airport I used the women's restroom, but I received a lot of confused looks.  I really don't like that kind of attention.
When I got to the second airport, in AZ, I decided it might just be easier to embrace that people perceived me as male.  I went into the male restroom, and received not even a sideward glance.  When people tried to engage me in conversation on the plane, I deepened my voice.  And as I exited the plane, a father said to his son ""no no, let the little man go first"" in regards to me...  And the young girl sitting next to me was trying to flirt with me the whole flight!

Overall, I found it easier to just pretend to be male than to have to deal with people apologizing to me for calling me sir, or looking at me strangely, but thinking back on it, maybe I'm doing the community a disservice by not using the opportunity to expose people to the fact that there is a spectrum of genders.

This post is really long overdue. I've been questioning my gender (and sexuality) since I was 14 or so, but I remember always feeling that female pronouns weren't quite... right. I'm very certain that I am *not* a lady/girl/woman/whatever. I don't have massive physical dysphoria (i.e. I don't hate my body that much ... usually); my main problem is when I'm referred to as female or treated as one. Y'all probably know how that feels so I'm not gonna describe it.

I've been kinda flipping between feeling trans (ftm), then agender/neutrois, then trans again for the past few years.

As for pronouns and whatnot, I've found that I generally don't care as long as they aren't female. He/him is great, they/their (and other neutral variations) is fine as well. I go by male- or neutral-sounding names on the internet (Sean and Sen mostly), so... yeah.

Also not sure about sexuality (demisexual/asexual/homosexual/panromantic???), but it probably helps that I'm a lonely virgin bastard who sits at home drawing and gaming all day thanks to some stupid choices I made (it's ok though, I'm gonna start studying from the autumn on).

15,2014-01-08 02:25:28,1uoeaw,4,7,"Hi! So I'm FAAB &amp; a lesbian and have identified as female for most of my childhood. I always called myself a girl, but looking back I distinctly did things associated with both males and females. For example, there's a picture of me at age 4 or 5 wearing a Tinkerbell dress watching my favorite movie - a documentary about building a road. 

In middle school, I really started to question my sexuality. I found myself ""forcing"" crushes on guys just so I'd have something to relate to my friends. By my freshman year, I was seriously questioning my sexuality. I didn't really confirm that I was a lesbian until sophomore year, when I dated a boy for exactly one week. I dumped him because I found myself scared of the idea of his penis. Also he was a jerk, but that's beside the point.

Anyway, coming out to myself and my friends as a lesbian made me feel significantly better. At the time, I was at a boarding school. I had some really fantastic friends who all sort of fit in the rebel-punk-queers category and everything was awesome. But then through a series of mental health failures I'm now living at home again for my junior (and likely senior) year. The people here are nice and generally accepting enough, but there are definitely notable exceptions that REALLY suck.

Anyway! Now to get to the gender bit. Like I said, I identified as female but it was never very strong. I never really felt like a boy, though, and I still don't. I just identify as not female now too. I feel like I'm really neither - like when someone asks if I'm a boy or a girl, the real answer is ""NO."" I know one openly genderqueer person and they're really awesome, but I've also only known them for a couple months so I don't feel totally comfortable going to them for gender help. My parents have enough on their plate with my mental health issues and my therapists are too focused on said issues to really be useful for this. While my friend group is very understanding and fairly well-educated on the LGBT, they know little about the Q, or more importantly, the GQ. So basically, I guess the point of this is that I just wanted to talk to somebody about my gender confusion - somebody who would understand and not judge me for it.

**TL;DR: FAAB lesbian who doesn't really identify as female anymore... but not male either. Nobody IRL is really aware of this.**

Oh, also! Names are basically my favorite thing and I've been thinking about a new name for myself, really just theoretical at this point. I've settled on Emerson for a first name, but I haven't picked a middle name. My birth name is Julia Marie (3 syllables, 2 syllables) and I want a new name following that. Emerson works with three, but what to do for a middle name...? The only one I've found so far is Bailey, which I do like, but any more ideas?

29,2014-01-10 21:30:23,1uwuh9,16,16,"Hi everyone!
Recently I came across the term ""genderqueer"" and since then I'm trying to figure out who I really am. I never really though about the possibility that my gender could be different from my biological sex. I've born as a female, but I've always been a tomboy. Even though I sometimes enjoyed playing with puppets and wearing a dress, most of the time I preferred doing more ""boyish"" things. Also, I preferred hanging out with boys rather than with girls. When I entered puberty I felt really uncomfortable with the idea of growing up and turning into a ""woman"". I don't know if it was because I didn't want to grow up or because I developed a really feminine body, but I started having some serious issues with my body and to fit in with the other girls. Now I'm 19 years old and I have developed a really curvy and feminine body with huge breasts. During the last years, I really had problems excepting my body, but now I am able to except it the way it is. I still enjoy a lot of ""boyish"" things but sometimes I also like doing girl stuff (even though I don't admit it most of the time...) Most of the things I wear are unisex clothes or men's clothes. I stopped wearing make-up about half a year ago but I still like wearing jewellery.

After doing some research about gender identities I think that I feel most comfortable with defining myself as androgyne. For me, this means that I identify myself as being a mixture of both traditional genders. It would be really nice if a could express this by looking a little bit more androgynous but due to my extremely feminine body, I guess this is impossible. But at the same time and don't want to wear a binder or to get top surgery because I like my upper-body. I'm thinking about getting my hair cut but then I'm a little bit afraid of the reactions that I'll get. Also, I don't really know what to do now that I've figured out that I'm androgyne. How is this going to affect my life? And how I'm a supposed to tell this other people? I'm afraid that my parents and friends are not going to take this seriously and will just think that I've got some kind of identity crisis that will pass sooner or later. I talked about this with one of my best friends who's really supportive and she said that basically everyone is more or less androgyne and that this isn't really something special. On the one hand I think she's right, but they must be some differences in the degree of androgynism, right?

I'm still really confused and I don't know what to do with this new awareness....

I realized today in a flash of insight that I am just *me*, after having browsed here a lot. I'm so done worrying about haters! I'm slowly feminizing my appearance and scaling back my masculine-reading mannerisms which I realize had developed as a defense mechanism to keep scrutiny of society from analyzing my genderqueer-ness and attacking me for it. I'm feeling so confident to just go ahead and be *myself* no matter what that is or how others want to try to define me. 

[Here's a picture or two](http://imgur.com/a/SRNZj) I took of myself today. I was looking at people in their eyes in a way I never have before, and was enjoying the expressions of confusion and surprise to intrigue on the faces of fellow travelers in the metro. What I had anticipated in my worries was scornful looks or disdain. Even if there were people who had that reaction, I must have just ignored them. I felt so confident because instead of trying to fit an ideal masculinity I couldn't attain, or to pine away dreaming of an ideal femininity I couldn't attain (both of these by the very nature of these harmful ""ideals"" that get instilled in us), neither of which really even interested me anyway, I just did what I felt and felt both attractive and comfortable, true to myself and beautiful, which is something I have rarely felt!

Can you tell me a story of how relieved you felt when you realized something like what I did today? It all clicked and I realized yes, this is exactly who I am, I'm done hiding or pretending, and it feels *great*! I'm genderqueer and definitely not sorry! I'm glad to be who I am.

&gt; Hey, so, as your probably don't know I've been having some long-standing struggles with gender identity and expression. It's not that I've always wanted to be a girl, but I've always been very unhappy with who I am for reasons I've never been able to pinpoint exactly, and presenting more o the feminine side has always seemed to allieviate that somewhat. So that leaves me with the problem of not knowing if I'm actually transgender or just a little genderqueer.

&gt;I've been experimenting with it in some controled settings like karaoke bars, friends houses and things but I think it's time now for a slightly more public test. I want to try for this semester to be female as much as I can to see if it's actually me. To help with that, if you guys would be so kind to call me Emily and use female pronouns that would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;I know this is kind of a weird way of going about this, generally people seem to wait until they are 100% sure they want to do this before attempting a social transition, and I know it's werid to ask to change your perceptions of me with the intention of potentially changing them back within the year, but it's the way I think things are going to have to go. If I wait until I'm 100% sure then I'm never going to be sure and I'll potentially never be happy with myself.

&gt;As a side note, as this is a experiment, I'm not going to be too offended if you forget occasionally or really just don't want to do it at first. If it turns out that this is for me and I decide to stick with it, that's when I'll start to be a little more pushy about it. 

&gt;Also, I welcome all questions about this, no matter how stupid you think it might be. The more I analyze myself and my situation the more I'll hopefully understand myself and figure out what I want.

73,2014-01-22 18:44:26,1vvcjt,7,3,"I've never posted here before, but have been lurking for some time, so hi everyone! I've found that the definition for intergender fits me best when it comes to gender identity as I don't really have days where I feel more or less feminine or masculine, I'm generally right down the middle the majority of the time. Physically I am very uncomfortable with some of my body's parts/shapes, (I forget the word used for this discomfort for one's assigned body) pretty much right down the middle as well.

Now, my frustrations stem from the general public's growing acceptance of LGBT stuff. I love that people are growing more and more accepting, but I'm finding that people are still nearly as unaccepting of anything not easily labeled as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. Most people, even young ones in their early 20's, seem to be very weary of anything that falls outside of those labels, or tries to tack the closest to one of those to us who don't fall directly into one.

I'm new to college and have made a few friends. One of which is actually generally pretty awesome and I don't intend to lose touch with. I'm also a very open book, so when the topic of gender/sexuality comes up (Which it does very often in the college setting. Who knew!?) sometimes the explanation of my gender identity (As well as others that don't fall into ""LGBT"") comes up.

Every time, people just brush it off as ""Well everyone wishes they could swap bodies/play with the other gender's parts for a day."" or ""Oh you're just a tomboy, that doesn't mean you have a different gender identity."" or ""Well it's one or the other!"" Etc... Every. Single. Time. Even when I get graphic and explain that I hate everything about my vagina and would give anything to have a penis, or that I'm already spending a lot of time and money to get bulky muscles, etc they generally say that I'm actually trans but just unwilling to go all the way with it.

It's all infinitely frustrating. I can get over it with the general public. I'm pretty good at not caring if I lose the friends I make, cause I can pretty easily make more. Not to mention my boyfriend generally understands it and is generally supportive of it and he's the one I care most about. However, this all comes up because that one friend i was hoping to actually keep is someone who simply refuses to accept it. it's pretty much the only flaw I can find in him as a friend, but it's starting to get on my nerves.

It's just little things he says that I don't think he realizes are hurtful and insensitive. He's openly said he doesn't understand my situation and is pretty sure I'm either going through a phase or just a tomboy. He's also accused me of being trans, when I've tried to explain that I'm totally not at all, and they are very different things. This last time was yesterday via texting.

Him:What is up with girls these days? I held a door open for a girl and she just gave me a ""you're a freak"" stare. like wtf?

Me: Lmao! why you askin' me? Girls be cray!

Him: But you are a girl! Why are you normal!?

Me: I told you I'm more like a boy!

Him: No you have a vagina... unless you're a tranny!

At this point I just rolled with the punches, though I did drop that tranny is an offensive word while also inaccurate for me. It's just this sort of behavior that happens *all the time* on campus between almost everyone. Hell, I've met a self-proclaimed ""super-lesbian"" (I think she was a ""gold-star"" lesbian, but wanted a different word for it I guess.) what refused to believe that I'm either not ""faking it"" or am just flat out trans. She also accused me of just being bisexual or a lesbian and didn't know it yet, or didn't know how to explain it properly. I'm not nearly, I'm like 97% straight for men (though who doesn't like boobs? lol) and that's about the end of it. She was the most hostile about the whole thing as well. I feel like she wanted to be a special snowflake in the group by being the only person to fall into something other than straight and aligned with their assigned gender.

Anyways, sorry for the rant, but I hope we can find another term outside of ""LGBT"" someday that can encompass all sexualities and genders, so people will actually do their research or otherwise actually believe there are things outside of the ""LGBT"" that they know.",genderqueer,Frustrated with a few things.,1390441466.0,"{'created_utc': 1390416266, 'id': '1vvcjt', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'I\'ve never posted here before, but have been lurking for some time, so hi everyone!

Well, now I'm almost glad I didn't drop him. We've had a bad row in the last session with him insisting that this was harmful and just a way to call for attention and me just being angry at him and shutting him out. He said very hurtful and ignorant things and I was sure I was done with him. 

I still had to see him though, so when today I got ready to see him I made sure to do my best and enter ""girl mode"" and most of all be very pacific about things and be open to dialogue. As we started talking he asked if I had thought about what he'd said and if those could be the reasons behind this.

I stayed calm and told him ""No, I don't see this as equal to self harm and I don't think my father has anything to do with it."" so he asked what I thought to be the reason and I told him I've actually explored this and come to the conclusion I've been like this my whole life. So he goes ""But you're more feminine tonight, not just in the way you're dressed but in the way you carry yourself, your face, your smile. Why?"" I replied honestly that it was to try and get him off my back with his harsh judgement. He looked pretty hit by that so he asked if I felt comfortable being feminine. I told him that yes, it had been a conscious choice to be more feminine and I was comfortable in it but at the same time there are days or weeks or months when I feel comfortable in being a boy and it doesn't mean refusing who I am because I'm always both. Because I'm always me.

And finally he admitted it ""I never met anyone like you, I don't know what you're talking about. Please, explain."" 

And I did. And he listened. He listened to everything, he really did. And he was grateful when I was done and asked me more questions and all very honestly and delicately. He was trying to understand, he even said he found this ""intriguing"". 

In the end he left me an assignment to look for what ""triggers"" the shift boy-girl, but just to know not to erase or fight the boy ones. 

I don't know if I'll keep seeing him because I don't think we're progressing much anymore in general and he still has some ideas and boxes where I can't and won't fit, but at least we might leave each other on a positive note. I don't really care for the therapist, honestly, I care for the man who I've seen take a step back and stop giving for granted that he was the only one with the truth in the room.

All right, let's talk about gender identity!


**Would the identities of genderqueer and non-binary exist if traditional gender roles and traits didn't exist?**


Based on what I have seen (mainly tumblr blogs of genderqueer and non-binary people, who blog about their experiences), genderqueer/non-binary peeps focus on how they present, and it often exists within the boundaries of boy/girl and masculine/feminine. It's hard to tear that away since (at least American) society operates on this binary, and it has for many years. But hear me out--if traits, roles, and modes of presentation weren't gendered at all, would the identities of genderqueer and non-binary exist? Especially for those who do not suffer from physical sex dysphoria? 


Because if nothing was gendered at all, we'd still probably have the trans identity, since physical sex dysphoria is very real and linked to something more solid (physical sex).

I am physically and emotionally attracted to women. But I am very strongly drawn toward women that identify as genderqueer (not trans). Before anyone asks if that's a cultural hangup; no. If you are physically and emotionally a woman I don't really care what you were born as and, to be honest, this has never come up in my romantic life (that I'm aware of at least) so it's irrelevant to this question.

To be more specific, I find many different types of women physically and/or sexually attractive but I am most often emotionally attracted to women that are ""slightly"" genderqueer. Not just ""tomboys"" but women who define their gender as ""other"" or who identify as having some gender characteristics generally considered ""male.""

The problem I run into is that the overwhelming majority of women I've met who fall into this category are also gay. As a result, I almost always end up friends. 

Don't get me wrong, ""just"" friends is great and many of the most significant relationships in my life are along these lines. However I often feel that, from others' perspective, I am ""that straight guy trying to convert a lesbian"" and that's just not me.

Any advice?

PS. No, I don't care at all if there's a label for my preferences or if this makes me something other that straight. I just want to know if anyone has any suggestions on how and where to meet straight/bi genderqueer women in a situation that is not inherently awkward; at least no more so than any dating scenario :) .

These days it's a lot easier for me, But I do find myself trying to push my boobs out a little as I walk into public women's restrooms.

A few days ago I took two flights from NM to Portland, OR.  Normally I just keep to myself and avoid talking to people (because I'm shy, not ashamed) but this time was different.  I had bought a cowboy hat in NM and the only way to get it back was to wear it on the flights back.  This little addition seemed to have a big effect on how I was perceived.  No one even questioned if I was male or female.  I was assumed to be a boy under the age of 18 (I'm 25 and very short).

At the first airport I used the women's restroom, but I received a lot of confused looks.  I really don't like that kind of attention.
When I got to the second airport, in AZ, I decided it might just be easier to embrace that people perceived me as male.  I went into the male restroom, and received not even a sideward glance.  When people tried to engage me in conversation on the plane, I deepened my voice.  And as I exited the plane, a father said to his son ""no no, let the little man go first"" in regards to me...  And the young girl sitting next to me was trying to flirt with me the whole flight!

Overall, I found it easier to just pretend to be male than to have to deal with people apologizing to me for calling me sir, or looking at me strangely, but thinking back on it, maybe I'm doing the community a disservice by not using the opportunity to expose people to the fact that there is a spectrum of genders.

This post is really long overdue. I've been questioning my gender (and sexuality) since I was 14 or so, but I remember always feeling that female pronouns weren't quite... right. I'm very certain that I am *not* a lady/girl/woman/whatever. I don't have massive physical dysphoria (i.e. I don't hate my body that much ... usually); my main problem is when I'm referred to as female or treated as one. Y'all probably know how that feels so I'm not gonna describe it.

I've been kinda flipping between feeling trans (ftm), then agender/neutrois, then trans again for the past few years. At first I figured it was a phase or whatever people say about it (as I was 14 when I first started questioning my gender for real and y'know, hormones and all that), but I don't think so anymore. I'm definitely not cis.

I've told my mum about some of this and she seems supportive. She's been kinda jokingly referring to me with male terms (like nephew instead of niece, those kinda things), and I like that, so that's cool (that said, I'm not sure what my dad would think if I specifically came out as trans*; I know he has said many times that ""people can do whatever they want [referring to sexuality] as long as they aren't being assholes"" and he knew a girl who he thought might have been either ftm or mtf [or genderqueer], but didn't ask her and didn't really care [her name was a feminine one, thus he referred to her as a girl]).

As for pronouns and whatnot, I've found that I generally don't care as long as they aren't female. He/him is great, they/their (and other neutral variations) is fine as well. I go by male- or neutral-sounding names on the internet (Sean and Sen mostly), so... yeah.

Also not sure about sexuality (demisexual/asexual/homosexual/panromantic???), but it probably helps that I'm a lonely virgin bastard who sits at home drawing and gaming all day thanks to some stupid choices I made (it's ok though, I'm gonna start studying from the autumn on).

25,2014-01-08 02:25:28,1uoeaw,4,7,"Hi! So I'm FAAB &amp; a lesbian and have identified as female for most of my childhood. I always called myself a girl, but looking back I distinctly did things associated with both males and females. For example, there's a picture of me at age 4 or 5 wearing a Tinkerbell dress watching my favorite movie - a documentary about building a road. 

In middle school, I really started to question my sexuality. I found myself ""forcing"" crushes on guys just so I'd have something to relate to my friends. By my freshman year, I was seriously questioning my sexuality. I didn't really confirm that I was a lesbian until sophomore year, when I dated a boy for exactly one week. I dumped him because I found myself scared of the idea of his penis. Also he was a jerk, but that's beside the point.

Anyway, coming out to myself and my friends as a lesbian made me feel significantly better. At the time, I was at a boarding school. I had some really fantastic friends who all sort of fit in the rebel-punk-queers category and everything was awesome. But then through a series of mental health failures I'm now living at home again for my junior (and likely senior) year. The people here are nice and generally accepting enough, but there are definitely notable exceptions that REALLY suck.

Anyway! Now to get to the gender bit. Like I said, I identified as female but it was never very strong. I never really felt like a boy, though, and I still don't. I just identify as not female now too. I feel like I'm really neither - like when someone asks if I'm a boy or a girl, the real answer is ""NO."" I know one openly genderqueer person and they're really awesome, but I've also only known them for a couple months so I don't feel totally comfortable going to them for gender help. My parents have enough on their plate with my mental health issues and my therapists are too focused on said issues to really be useful for this. While my friend group is very understanding and fairly well-educated on the LGBT, they know little about the Q, or more importantly, the GQ. So basically, I guess the point of this is that I just wanted to talk to somebody about my gender confusion - somebody who would understand and not judge me for it.

**TL;DR: FAAB lesbian who doesn't really identify as female anymore... but not male either. Nobody IRL is really aware of this.**

Oh, also! Names are basically my favorite thing and I've been thinking about a new name for myself, really just theoretical at this point. I've settled on Emerson for a first name, but I haven't picked a middle name. My birth name is Julia Marie (3 syllables, 2 syllables) and I want a new name following that. Emerson works with three, but what to do for a middle name...? The only one I've found so far is Bailey, which I do like, but any more ideas?

Recently I came across the term ""genderqueer"" and since then I'm trying to figure out who I really am. I never really though about the possibility that my gender could be different from my biological sex. I've born as a female, but I've always been a tomboy. Even though I sometimes enjoyed playing with puppets and wearing a dress, most of the time I preferred doing more ""boyish"" things. Also, I preferred hanging out with boys rather than with girls. When I entered puberty I felt really uncomfortable with the idea of growing up and turning into a ""woman"". I don't know if it was because I didn't want to grow up or because I developed a really feminine body, but I started having some serious issues with my body and to fit in with the other girls. Now I'm 19 years old and I have developed a really curvy and feminine body with huge breasts. During the last years, I really had problems excepting my body, but now I am able to except it the way it is. I still enjoy a lot of ""boyish"" things but sometimes I also like doing girl stuff (even though I don't admit it most of the time...) Most of the things I wear are unisex clothes or men's clothes. I stopped wearing make-up about half a year ago but I still like wearing jewellery.

After doing some research about gender identities I think that I feel most comfortable with defining myself as androgyne. For me, this means that I identify myself as being a mixture of both traditional genders. It would be really nice if a could express this by looking a little bit more androgynous but due to my extremely feminine body, I guess this is impossible. But at the same time and don't want to wear a binder or to get top surgery because I like my upper-body. I'm thinking about getting my hair cut but then I'm a little bit afraid of the reactions that I'll get. Also, I don't really know what to do now that I've figured out that I'm androgyne. How is this going to affect my life? And how I'm a supposed to tell this other people? I'm afraid that my parents and friends are not going to take this seriously and will just think that I've got some kind of identity crisis that will pass sooner or later. I talked about this with one of my best friends who's really supportive and she said that basically everyone is more or less androgyne and that this isn't really something special. On the one hand I think she's right, but they must be some differences in the degree of androgynism, right?

I'm still really confused and I don't know what to do with this new awareness....

&gt; Hey, so, as your probably don't know I've been having some long-standing struggles with gender identity and expression. It's not that I've always wanted to be a girl, but I've always been very unhappy with who I am for reasons I've never been able to pinpoint exactly, and presenting more o the feminine side has always seemed to allieviate that somewhat. So that leaves me with the problem of not knowing if I'm actually transgender or just a little genderqueer.

&gt;I've been experimenting with it in some controled settings like karaoke bars, friends houses and things but I think it's time now for a slightly more public test. I want to try for this semester to be female as much as I can to see if it's actually me. To help with that, if you guys would be so kind to call me Emily and use female pronouns that would be greatly appreciated.

&gt;I know this is kind of a weird way of going about this, generally people seem to wait until they are 100% sure they want to do this before attempting a social transition, and I know it's werid to ask to change your perceptions of me with the intention of potentially changing them back within the year, but it's the way I think things are going to have to go. If I wait until I'm 100% sure then I'm never going to be sure and I'll potentially never be happy with myself.

&gt;As a side note, as this is a experiment, I'm not going to be too offended if you forget occasionally or really just don't want to do it at first. If it turns out that this is for me and I decide to stick with it, that's when I'll start to be a little more pushy about it. 

&gt;Also, I welcome all questions about this, no matter how stupid you think it might be. The more I analyze myself and my situation the more I'll hopefully understand myself and figure out what I want.

101,2014-01-22 18:44:26,1vvcjt,7,3,"I've never posted here before, but have been lurking for some time, so hi everyone! I've found that the definition for intergender fits me best when it comes to gender identity as I don't really have days where I feel more or less feminine or masculine, I'm generally right down the middle the majority of the time. Physically I am very uncomfortable with some of my body's parts/shapes, (I forget the word used for this discomfort for one's assigned body) pretty much right down the middle as well.

Now, my frustrations stem from the general public's growing acceptance of LGBT stuff. I love that people are growing more and more accepting, but I'm finding that people are still nearly as unaccepting of anything not easily labeled as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. Most people, even young ones in their early 20's, seem to be very weary of anything that falls outside of those labels, or tries to tack the closest to one of those to us who don't fall directly into one.

I'm new to college and have made a few friends. One of which is actually generally pretty awesome and I don't intend to lose touch with. I'm also a very open book, so when the topic of gender/sexuality comes up (Which it does very often in the college setting. Who knew!?) sometimes the explanation of my gender identity (As well as others that don't fall into ""LGBT"") comes up.

Every time, people just brush it off as ""Well everyone wishes they could swap bodies/play with the other gender's parts for a day."" or ""Oh you're just a tomboy, that doesn't mean you have a different gender identity."" or ""Well it's one or the other!"" Etc... Every. Single. Time. Even when I get graphic and explain that I hate everything about my vagina and would give anything to have a penis, or that I'm already spending a lot of time and money to get bulky muscles, etc they generally say that I'm actually trans but just unwilling to go all the way with it.

It's all infinitely frustrating. I can get over it with the general public. I'm pretty good at not caring if I lose the friends I make, cause I can pretty easily make more. Not to mention my boyfriend generally understands it and is generally supportive of it and he's the one I care most about. However, this all comes up because that one friend i was hoping to actually keep is someone who simply refuses to accept it. it's pretty much the only flaw I can find in him as a friend, but it's starting to get on my nerves.

It's just little things he says that I don't think he realizes are hurtful and insensitive. He's openly said he doesn't understand my situation and is pretty sure I'm either going through a phase or just a tomboy. He's also accused me of being trans, when I've tried to explain that I'm totally not at all, and they are very different things. This last time was yesterday via texting.

Him:What is up with girls these days? I held a door open for a girl and she just gave me a ""you're a freak"" stare. like wtf?

Me: Lmao! why you askin' me? Girls be cray!

Him: But you are a girl! Why are you normal!?

Me: I told you I'm more like a boy!

Him: No you have a vagina... unless you're a tranny!

At this point I just rolled with the punches, though I did drop that tranny is an offensive word while also inaccurate for me. It's just this sort of behavior that happens *all the time* on campus between almost everyone. Hell, I've met a self-proclaimed ""super-lesbian"" (I think she was a ""gold-star"" lesbian, but wanted a different word for it I guess.) what refused to believe that I'm either not ""faking it"" or am just flat out trans. She also accused me of just being bisexual or a lesbian and didn't know it yet, or didn't know how to explain it properly. I'm not nearly, I'm like 97% straight for men (though who doesn't like boobs? lol) and that's about the end of it. She was the most hostile about the whole thing as well. I feel like she wanted to be a special snowflake in the group by being the only person to fall into something other than straight and aligned with their assigned gender.

Anyways, sorry for the rant, but I hope we can find another term outside of ""LGBT"" someday that can encompass all sexualities and genders, so people will actually do their research or otherwise actually believe there are things outside of the ""LGBT"" that they know.",genderqueer,Frustrated with a few things.,1390441466.0,"{'created_utc': 1390416266, 'id': '1vvcjt', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'I\'ve never posted here before, but have been lurking for some time, so hi everyone!

Physically I am very uncomfortable with some of my body\'s parts/shapes, (I forget the word used for this discomfort for one\'s assigned body) pretty much right down the middle as well.\n\nNow, my frustrations stem from the general public\'s growing acceptance of LGBT stuff. I love that people are growing more and more accepting, but I\'m finding that people are still nearly as unaccepting of anything not easily labeled as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender. Most people, even young ones in their early 20\'s, seem to be very weary of anything that falls outside of those labels, or tries to tack the closest to one of those to us who don\'t fall directly into one.\n\nI\'m new to college and have made a few friends. One of which is actually generally pretty awesome and I don\'t intend to lose touch with. I\'m also a very open book, so when the topic of gender/sexuality comes up (Which it does very often in the college setting. Who knew!?) sometimes the explanation of my gender identity (As well as others that don\'t fall into ""LGBT"") comes up.\n\nEvery time, people just brush it off as ""Well everyone wishes they could swap bodies/play with the other gender\'s parts for a day."" or ""Oh you\'re just a tomboy, that doesn\'t mean you have a different gender identity."" or ""Well it\'s one or the other!"" Etc... Every. Single. Time. Even when I get graphic and explain that I hate everything about my vagina and would give anything to have a penis, or that I\'m already spending a lot of time and money to get bulky muscles, etc they generally say that I\'m actually trans but just unwilling to go all the way with it.\n\nIt\'s all infinitely frustrating. I can get over it with the general public. I\'m pretty good at not caring if I lose the friends I make, cause I can pretty easily make more. Not to mention my boyfriend generally understands it and is generally supportive of it and he\'s the one I care most about. However, this all comes up because that one friend i was hoping to actually keep is someone who simply refuses to accept it. it\'s pretty much the only flaw I can find in him as a friend, but it\'s starting to get on my nerves.\n\nIt\'s just little things he says that I don\'t think he realizes are hurtful and insensitive. He\'s openly said he doesn\'t understand my situation and is pretty sure I\'m either going through a phase or just a tomboy. He\'s also accused me of being trans, when I\'ve tried to explain that I\'m totally not at all, and they are very different things. This last time was yesterday via texting.\n\nHim:What is up with girls these days? I held a door open for a girl and she just gave me a ""you\'re a freak"" stare. like wtf?\n\nMe: Lmao! why you askin\' me? Girls be cray!\n\nHim: But you are a girl! Why are you normal!?\n\nMe: I told you I\'m more like a boy!\n\nHim: No you have a vagina... unless you\'re a tranny!\n\nAt this point I just rolled with the punches, though I did drop that tranny is an offensive word while also inaccurate for me. It\'s just this sort of behavior that happens *all the time* on campus between almost everyone. Hell, I\'ve met a self-proclaimed ""super-lesbian"" (I think she was a ""gold-star"" lesbian, but wanted a different word for it I guess.) what refused to believe that I\'m either not ""faking it"" or am just flat out trans. She also accused me of just being bisexual or a lesbian and didn\'t know it yet, or didn\'t know how to explain it properly. I\'m not nearly, I\'m like 97% straight for men (though who doesn\'t like boobs? lol) and that\'s about the end of it. She was the most hostile about the whole thing as well. I feel like she wanted to be a special snowflake in the group by being the only person to fall into something other than straight and aligned with their assigned gender.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the rant, but I hope we can find another term outside of ""LGBT"" someday that can encompass all sexualities and genders, so people will actually do their research or otherwise actually believe there are things outside of the ""LGBT"" that they know.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Frustrated with a few things.', 'created': 1390441466.0}",73.0

Well, now I'm almost glad I didn't drop him. We've had a bad row in the last session with him insisting that this was harmful and just a way to call for attention and me just being angry at him and shutting him out. He said very hurtful and ignorant things and I was sure I was done with him. 

I still had to see him though, so when today I got ready to see him I made sure to do my best and enter ""girl mode"" and most of all be very pacific about things and be open to dialogue. As we started talking he asked if I had thought about what he'd said and if those could be the reasons behind this.

I stayed calm and told him ""No, I don't see this as equal to self harm and I don't think my father has anything to do with it."" so he asked what I thought to be the reason and I told him I've actually explored this and come to the conclusion I've been like this my whole life. So he goes ""But you're more feminine tonight, not just in the way you're dressed but in the way you carry yourself, your face, your smile. Why?"" I replied honestly that it was to try and get him off my back with his harsh judgement. He looked pretty hit by that so he asked if I felt comfortable being feminine. I told him that yes, it had been a conscious choice to be more feminine and I was comfortable in it but at the same time there are days or weeks or months when I feel comfortable in being a boy and it doesn't mean refusing who I am because I'm always both. Because I'm always me.

And finally he admitted it ""I never met anyone like you, I don't know what you're talking about. Please, explain."" 

And I did. And he listened. He listened to everything, he really did. And he was grateful when I was done and asked me more questions and all very honestly and delicately. He was trying to understand, he even said he found this ""intriguing"". 

In the end he left me an assignment to look for what ""triggers"" the shift boy-girl, but just to know not to erase or fight the boy ones. 

I don't know if I'll keep seeing him because I don't think we're progressing much anymore in general and he still has some ideas and boxes where I can't and won't fit, but at least we might leave each other on a positive note. I don't really care for the therapist, honestly, I care for the man who I've seen take a step back and stop giving for granted that he was the only one with the truth in the room.

All right, let's talk about gender identity!


**Would the identities of genderqueer and non-binary exist if traditional gender roles and traits didn't exist?**


Based on what I have seen (mainly tumblr blogs of genderqueer and non-binary people, who blog about their experiences), genderqueer/non-binary peeps focus on how they present, and it often exists within the boundaries of boy/girl and masculine/feminine. It's hard to tear that away since (at least American) society operates on this binary, and it has for many years. But hear me out--if traits, roles, and modes of presentation weren't gendered at all, would the identities of genderqueer and non-binary exist? Especially for those who do not suffer from physical sex dysphoria? 


Because if nothing was gendered at all, we'd still probably have the trans identity, since physical sex dysphoria is very real and linked to something more solid (physical sex).

To clarify:
I am physically and emotionally attracted to women. But I am very strongly drawn toward women that identify as genderqueer (not trans). Before anyone asks if that's a cultural hangup; no. If you are physically and emotionally a woman I don't really care what you were born as and, to be honest, this has never come up in my romantic life (that I'm aware of at least) so it's irrelevant to this question.

To be more specific, I find many different types of women physically and/or sexually attractive but I am most often emotionally attracted to women that are ""slightly"" genderqueer. Not just ""tomboys"" but women who define their gender as ""other"" or who identify as having some gender characteristics generally considered ""male.""

The problem I run into is that the overwhelming majority of women I've met who fall into this category are also gay. As a result, I almost always end up friends. 

Don't get me wrong, ""just"" friends is great and many of the most significant relationships in my life are along these lines. However I often feel that, from others' perspective, I am ""that straight guy trying to convert a lesbian"" and that's just not me.

Any advice?

PS. No, I don't care at all if there's a label for my preferences or if this makes me something other that straight. I just want to know if anyone has any suggestions on how and where to meet straight/bi genderqueer women in a situation that is not inherently awkward; at least no more so than any dating scenario :) .

But last night I just went 'screw this' and wore what I wanted and while I certainly still got read as female, at least I wasn't underdressed for once! I think knowing transition is on the horizon made it a little easier. :)
