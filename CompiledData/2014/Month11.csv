I'm currently in my last year of undergraduate education, and after that, i'm off to grad school. I've been transitioning for 2 and a half years, and luckily was able to pull off living full time as soon as i started transitioning thanks to my pre-hrt androgynous boy body.  As a child i would be mistaken for a girl all the time, and though it used to frustrate my parents, it made my heart flutter in secrecy because people were seeing me for the girl i knew i was at heart. I don't want to go in to a full blown autobiography because i sure as hell know i wouldn't want to read such a long passage. I digress to my original question and concern. Have any of you guys rejected a girl in the past that you liked when she told you she was transgender? I am lucky enough that i get approached by men, but i am always honest and tell them up front that i'm trans. Not all of them are repelled by it, but i would say that at least 80-90% of them can't deal with such a debilitating fact( at least to them it is), and they tell me that they aren't gay and never talk to me again. Why are guys so worried about labels when it comes to who they are attracted to. They were initially attracted to me because they saw a girl, but when i told them about my past they didn't see me as a girl anymore(bummer, i know) and went on to tell me they aren't gay. 1) gay guys aren't attracted to girls, hence why i can't date gay men. 2) if there was a definitional term that described someone's romantic interest for transgender people, would they be more comfortable dating us, therfore not having to worry about being labeled gay? 3) why do guys have to care so much about a label so much that they reject an opportunity of love with someone they obviously find attractive and have chemistry with? I am not on  transgender dating sites for a couple of reasons: most of them just want me to fuck them in the ass ( which i guess falls under the fantasy category), they want me to keep my girly c**k, they live too far away, and there is a limited amount of men in my area.  In all honesty, i've had better success with men who weren't looking for a transchick, but they just happen to stumble upon yours truly. Where are the men who don't care about what society thinks about their personal romantic choices? Where are the men who aren't so focused on the GAY label. ugh! look at me! I'm a girl!! I currently have blonde hair at the moment, so the pics with blonde are most recent; including the one in the pirate costume that i took this past halloween night.

I finally feel like a human being, but I can't seem to cope with the fact that I missed out for so long, missed having a ""normal"" youth, missed having made sexual experiences and/ or having a relationship and so on.


I'm 35yrs old, ftm, gay...I started hormones when I was 30.

Until I turned 20 I had a nice bunch of friends, but was always the quiet one, enjoyed being around people but most times was minding my own business. 
I never really felt like a girl, but was not really familiar with the concept of transsexuality, so I thought that I'm just some sort of freak, a lovely one though.

I hardly had female friends back then and all my guy-friends treated me like one of their own....rumor started I'd be a lesbian (even though I never was interested in women)... I didn't care really, maybe I was a latebloomer, but I just wasn't really that interested in sex and relationship back then, I was pretty succesfull with sports and that was what I was doing in my free time.

After school I felt like I need to move away to get away from the life I was living and maybe find myself, I got a job in the music business and turned into a workaholic, I've worked up to 10-12hrs a day every day and going partying in my free time including all the alcohol and drug abuse that comes with it. 

I've made a cut with 25, quit my job and tried going to college but started struggeling with social phobia and depression, to an extent that I wasn't even able to pick up the phone when someone was calling. I was unemployed living from welfare for approx 5 years, I didn't have any contact to the outside world during that time, spending my days playing computer games, reading books, watching videos and sleeping. 

Life did get incredibly better since I started hormones and living as who I am: a pretty laid-back, educated, polite and fun guy to hang round with.


I'm 35 and I look like a teenager due to the fact I'm super small and slim (168cm, ~55kg) and I feel like I'm 20 just finished school and gonna start over with my life now....and it feels like I don't fit in anywhere really.
I mean, I'm actually a happy person when I'm all for myself but whenever I'm around people...I'm stressed.
I don't get along with people my age really as I feel somewhat inferior to them what has a lot to do with my physical specs I think, but also because I just never really have worked in my life so far or had a relationship and such. Also: most people my age just live a whole different life and I don't even know if I ever turn that way.
On the other hand: onn college I don't really want to hang out with those kids either as most of them are just ...""kids"", they're in their 20's and 15 years can make a hell of a difference.
I have a lot of people around me but I really don't feel like I enjoy being around them
I'd consider myself to have 1 friend, she's my best triend since like 15 years and the only person I still have contact with from pre-transition times. 

As for relationships and sex:
I'd love to have that but I'm super insecure and ashamed of not having ANY experience. Given the fact I'm ftm doesn't make things easier to explain to people. 

All of this is draining (or already has drained) all life energy from me and I'm super afraid of failing college as I'm just getting more and more lazy and start retreating from social life again (but only because I don't really find people I really enjoy hanging around with), I can't find motivation to go to lectures, read books, study and so on.

Actually, my life really ain't that bad, I just don't know how to deal with the fact I've lost so many years and failed to make so many experiences in the past.

34,2014-11-22 23:17:38,2n4b4f,10,1,"I would like to start and say that I'm not transgender. I'm androgynous and my gender has never been a huge part of who I am, and I came to terms with myself many years ago in this respect. But I will say this much, if this is anything what you people go through, then I have my absolute condolences.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place, there is no subreddit for the exact crisis that I'm going through and since it after talking with a few transwomen about my experiences and the relatedness of our issues we decided this is the best place to talk about it.

On Thursday I received a stark reminder of a skeleton that I have been trying to hide for years. I was reading an article about identity disorders, and I was reading transgender people putting their own input into it. One was explaining to a cisgendered person what the whole transwoman thing was all about. The person described it as being a mental unhappiness with her own body.

And suddenly that skeleton emerged. Not in the form of gender, but in the form of a disability.

While my earliest memories confound me (a skiing accident is likely the root of this), my earliest memories of a conflict of between my body and my image was when I was 8 years old or so (give or take a year). I remember for some reason, out of absolutely nowhere, that I was a blind actress. I imagined myself listening to people talk about me, and it felt like my destiny. That evening, as the sun set, I began to stare into it with my right eye. Due to the fact that it was late, and that staring into the sun is extremely difficult, no permanent damage outside of photosensitivity occurred in that eye. 

As I was going through my teenage years, I kept having little thoughts and ""fantasies"" (not sexual mind you) of going blind. Different stories, different actions all leading to the same thing.  I specifically remember spending a lot of time when I was in chemistry thinking about these things. There was a Carol Poster (http://www.flinnsci.com/store/catalogPhotos/AP6373.jpg) in the room, which was a running gag with the teacher. Most students saw the intended message - wear your safety goggles.

But I asked how it happened. I wanted to know what the story behind her descent into darkness was. And as wrong as it may sound, it was to fix what was wrong with myself.

Through these years, I felt that there was some way that I had to be. Some way that I had to follow metaphorical Carol into the darkness myself. A gravitational pull into a black hole, where no light would ever come out of again. 

Years passed. I got in a relationship with a blind man. Born with light perception, it was the most interesting experience I think I've had to this day. And for some reason I would constantly want to trade with him, just to *know*. My other blind friends thought this was fairly strange, but I think he seemed to understand. He told me that he thinks that I was reincarnated from a blind person who died in a horrific accident. I don't really believe in reincarnation, but I used the idea to try to ""vent"" these persistent feelings, which, as time went on grew stronger and stronger.

Within this conflict, I realized there were two players - emotion and logic. Logic is the only reason why I'm where I'm at now in life - thanks to logic I'm still able to have functionality in my eyes. But emotion is the skeletons in my closet. It, since that day as a child, that it wants a means to an end. People say to me - ""What if you regret your decision 10 years from now?"" and they don't understand that the feelings have only grown more intense in the last 13! It's very very scary though.

I realized on Thursday that submission of logic is inevitable. Logic requires reasons to continue to protect myself, and thus presents reasons why I can't stick a vial of lye in my eyes. The emotional side thus struck a deal - when there is a case when all of these ""open shoelaces"" are eventually ""tied"", it would be able to triumph against the logic. I have gotten extremely close to taking this away from me for ever on several occasions, due to this lack of of ""open shoelaces"" - it was honestly only because I discovered some at the last minute that I still have my vision. I now am considering writing a list of ""open shoelaces"" of accomplishments that I must make so that if I lose this battle, that I have completed what I wanted to do.

I'm mostly scared not because of who I am but how the world will perceive me. People are so foolish with blindness, they act like going blind is like dying. I know enough people going blind to know this isn't the truth, and that it's the perpetuation of these ideas that scare people more than the actual loss itself. I learned that my life could be manageable. But what holds me back is that if they ever found out the truth to my own mutilation, when I do it, they won't just see me as a poor blind woman, but they'll see me as a crazy horrible person. They'll want me locked up, and that's the worst thing they can do. To strip everything that I am because I tried to absolve myself from an evil feeling that will never go away, a feeling that grows with each sunset, with every image I see, until that fateful day comes.

Like I've said, it's not really a matter of if anymore, the shock on Thursday made me realize this. I have to open my arms and weep, knowing that my demons will one day consume me. And it's not that I fear it, but rather that I don't know what the future will hold. All I know is that my mind keeps begging for become it.

After telling my transwoman friend about it, she told me that if I use a blindfold that it would help relieve some of these tensions, for the same reason many transgender people wear the opposite sex's clothes. It did help, I was surprised. But I know that's not going to be good enough. It can pacify my inherent desires now. But it won't work forever. I'm thinking about getting completely black contacts and using them always while I'm in my apartment... but even that won't protect me.

I'm afraid of becoming a ""pretender"". I fully respect the men and women that who were born without a choice to the condition that my brain so idolizes. I have deep running morals, tied deeply with my internal obsession with canes, obscuring sunglasses, and the like. To me they're off limits until that day comes. Why? Because I am not someone who wants to ""pretend"", and I cannot submit to ""pretending"". People who pretend to be blind for jokes and things like that make me so furious, and it's instantly able to be seen, because the idiots have no idea how to use a damn cane. I vowed to myself I would never fall to that low. But I've taught myself how to use one. I even will be using it for a costume after I got a severe foot injury wearing it. And I feel that using it will simply indulge myself more, when my thoughts turn into nothing but this, and I have to face the darkness one last time.

I'm preparing myself for my future. I think people know that there is a dark side, I think they can sense it. I know the blindies know, but even others have seemed to give that vibe. They know that my obsessions with blindness, their techniques of observing the world, and my interest in empathizing with their experience runs deep.

I know that I need help, I'm going to speak to someone soon. I'm scared. I don't want to be considered crazy - I'm otherwise quite mentally stable despite my other challenges. I'm able to manage a full time job, school, personal life and even this without breaking down, and when I did there was a reason and I recovered. It's not like I'm crazy, but I know these urges are growing more intense, and know that logic is going to be cornered eventually and have to submit. I'm scared of that future, but I also want to embrace it. It's a oxymoron that persists through my mind - a feeling of denial of existence but fear of removing my own. Tension has come to a boil and I have no choice but to come out.

Before this, I used these feelings to empathize with the community and take and help them with their own challenges and the inequalities they faced. And even though I will continue to dedicate myself to that cause, I cannot just pour it all into that bucket anymore.

I don't want to attach any sort of ""trans"" label onto myself, ultimately because I am conflicted on any sort of transition, despite knowing that it will come eventually. My brain's freedom from these thoughts is becoming so much smaller and smaller.

Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place. There is literally nowhere else I can put this, outside of the small blind forums of those whom I trust, to which I've already written. I gathered all of my strength to post here, I'm sorry if it's not right. If this goes against the rules, then so be it. But I believe that if this is what dysphoria is then I have all of my sympathies.

I got in a relationship with a blind man. Born with light perception, it was the most interesting experience I think I\'ve had to this day. And for some reason I would constantly want to trade with him, just to *know*. My other blind friends thought this was fairly strange, but I think he seemed to understand. He told me that he thinks that I was reincarnated from a blind person who died in a horrific accident. I don\'t really believe in reincarnation, but I used the idea to try to ""vent"" these persistent feelings, which, as time went on grew stronger and stronger.\n\nWithin this conflict, I realized there were two players - emotion and logic. Logic is the only reason why I\'m where I\'m at now in life - thanks to logic I\'m still able to have functionality in my eyes. But emotion is the skeletons in my closet. It, since that day as a child, that it wants a means to an end. People say to me - ""What if you regret your decision 10 years from now?"" and they don\'t understand that the feelings have only grown more intense in the last 13! It\'s very very scary though.\n\nI realized on Thursday that submission of logic is inevitable. Logic requires reasons to continue to protect myself, and thus presents reasons why I can\'t stick a vial of lye in my eyes. The emotional side thus struck a deal - when there is a case when all of these ""open shoelaces"" are eventually ""tied"", it would be able to triumph against the logic. I have gotten extremely close to taking this away from me for ever on several occasions, due to this lack of of ""open shoelaces"" - it was honestly only because I discovered some at the last minute that I still have my vision. I now am considering writing a list of ""open shoelaces"" of accomplishments that I must make so that if I lose this battle, that I have completed what I wanted to do.\n\nI\'m mostly scared not because of who I am but how the world will perceive me. People are so foolish with blindness, they act like going blind is like dying. I know enough people going blind to know this isn\'t the truth, and that it\'s the perpetuation of these ideas that scare people more than the actual loss itself. I learned that my life could be manageable. But what holds me back is that if they ever found out the truth to my own mutilation, when I do it, they won\'t just see me as a poor blind woman, but they\'ll see me as a crazy horrible person. They\'ll want me locked up, and that\'s the worst thing they can do. To strip everything that I am because I tried to absolve myself from an evil feeling that will never go away, a feeling that grows with each sunset, with every image I see, until that fateful day comes.\n\nLike I\'ve said, it\'s not really a matter of if anymore, the shock on Thursday made me realize this. I have to open my arms and weep, knowing that my demons will one day consume me. And it\'s not that I fear it, but rather that I don\'t know what the future will hold. All I know is that my mind keeps begging for become it.\n\nAfter telling my transwoman friend about it, she told me that if I use a blindfold that it would help relieve some of these tensions, for the same reason many transgender people wear the opposite sex\'s clothes. It did help, I was surprised. But I know that\'s not going to be good enough. It can pacify my inherent desires now. But it won\'t work forever. I\'m thinking about getting completely black contacts and using them always while I\'m in my apartment... but even that won\'t protect me.\n\nI\'m afraid of becoming a ""pretender"". I fully respect the men and women that who were born without a choice to the condition that my brain so idolizes. I have deep running morals, tied deeply with my internal obsession with canes, obscuring sunglasses, and the like. To me they\'re off limits until that day comes. Why? Because I am not someone who wants to ""pretend"", and I cannot submit to ""pretending"". People who pretend to be blind for jokes and things like that make me so furious, and it\'s instantly able to be seen, because the idiots have no idea how to use a damn cane. I vowed to myself I would never fall to that low. But I\'ve taught myself how to use one. I even will be using it for a costume after I got a severe foot injury wearing it. And I feel that using it will simply indulge myself more, when my thoughts turn into nothing but this, and I have to face the darkness one last time.\n\nI\'m preparing myself for my future. I think people know that there is a dark side, I think they can sense it. I know the blindies know, but even others have seemed to give that vibe. They know that my obsessions with blindness, their techniques of observing the world, and my interest in empathizing with their experience runs deep.\n\nI know that I need help, I\'m going to speak to someone soon. I\'m scared. I don\'t want to be considered crazy - I\'m otherwise quite mentally stable despite my other challenges. I\'m able to manage a full time job, school, personal life and even this without breaking down, and when I did there was a reason and I recovered. It\'s not like I\'m crazy, but I know these urges are growing more intense, and know that logic is going to be cornered eventually and have to submit. I\'m scared of that future, but I also want to embrace it. It\'s a oxymoron that persists through my mind - a feeling of denial of existence but fear of removing my own. Tension has come to a boil and I have no choice but to come out.\n\nBefore this, I used these feelings to empathize with the community and take and help them with their own challenges and the inequalities they faced. And even though I will continue to dedicate myself to that cause, I cannot just pour it all into that bucket anymore.\n\nI don\'t want to attach any sort of ""trans"" label onto myself, ultimately because I am conflicted on any sort of transition, despite knowing that it will come eventually. My brain\'s freedom from these thoughts is becoming so much smaller and smaller.\n\nAgain, I\'m sorry if this isn\'t the right place. There is literally nowhere else I can put this, outside of the small blind forums of those whom I trust, to which I\'ve already written. I gathered all of my strength to post here, I\'m sorry if it\'s not right. If this goes against the rules, then so be it. But I believe that if this is what dysphoria is then I have all of my sympathies.\n\nThank you for reading.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Cornered', 'created': 1416723458.0}",

11,2014-11-02 17:27:07,2l2tub,15,9,"Hello, all you wonderful people.

Recently, I've been spending a lot of time thrifting, and discovered that a lot of womens wear gets mixed in with the mens wear and vice versa.  I realized that store clerks -- both male and female -- frequently ""misidentify"" certain items of clothing with greater frequency than others.

Wonderful lambswool/cashmere sweaters from Gap, Banana Republic, and Lands' End in both mens and womens cuts seem to have a lot of overlap, and work whether one is in boymode, girlmode, both or neithermode.

Some styles of Christopher &amp; Banks womens pants and Express mens pants look nearly identical, except for the cut. Khaki and gray herringbone Lee Riders for women are styled like mens pants, but have an awesome feminine fit (on me anyway).

Some H&amp;M finds from the mens section look entirely like womens styles in cut, fabric, and style -- but the tags say ""mens"" (which is the only mens part about them, really).

Buttonups of all sorts with wider cuffs and slimmer/modern cuts -- with and without spandex -- are also all over the place, and sometimes the m/f button sides are reversed despite what the tags say.

I want 'girls' hair, I want my hair longer. The longer my hair gets the more I love how I look. It's... I'm a person with long hair, but am forced to keep it short.

I took the deal instantly. 60$ a year to express my identity in regards to my hair? Fuck yeah, that'd be awesome. I was super excited. 

Aaand then she sits down with my dad, and they decide in less than a minute that it's their house and their rules, so I have to get it cut short next time. They didn't even ask me they just decided that if I'm going to get their support it comes with an imposed expresion of my gender. I don't feel safe to be me at home.

The one who was fine with my being bi, the one who loves my trans girlfriend and goes beyond just tolerating her and wearing a smile. She's the one I look to for support on who I am, and she's the one imposing gender and gender roles on myself and my siblings (who to the best of my knowledge are cis, though my sister has touches of GQ in her that seem to go a touch beyond 'tomboy', but she hasn't said anything to me on it).

I can't seem to figure out what I am, and it causes me a lot of confusion and anxiety. 

I'll go into detail, because I don't want to leave any stone unturned I guess. Sorry if this is long. 

--------------

I'm MAAB, and ever since I was very young, I knew something was different about me, but I had no idea what. A lot of narratives have trans girls saying they knew from a young age they were supposed to be a girl. I didn't have the faintest idea of that, I just knew something was off. 

I had urges to crossdress as young as 5, I wanted to see myself in girl clothes sometimes. I saw my sisters putting on makeup when I was 9, and sorry about this weirdness, but it excited me and I guess was perfect timing for puberty because it became a fetish. 

I continued to crossdress only occasionally in my sister's clothes, and much more frequently I would play with their makeup, or sneak into my aunt's bathroom when we were at her house, to go through her makeup. It was definitely a fetish as it seemed sexually driven. 

I never knew that I might want to be a girl, it never clicked for me. In reality, I was deeply ashamed of these desires and tried my best to forget about them. My sisters made fun of me and I think I was so ashamed I just did my best to hide it and not do anything with it. 

The only thing I knew is that I didn't feel like much of a boy. I wanted to be a boy, but it felt like I just couldn't the way everyone else so easily was able to. 

At puberty, I developed a desire for boys. I had my first sexual experience with a boy, and was ashamed immediately after. I was especially ashamed of just how much I *loved* it. I went home and tried to pretend like it never happened. I didn't want to be gay. 

I would continue to have these fantasies, that the same boy would come over and I would dress up for him in my sister's clothes, and he would bend me over and pull up the skirt...etc. 

At the same time, I was deeply ashamed. I compartmentalized these desires and did my absolute best to be a ""man"". I tried so fucking hard. I felt like I wanted to be a man more than anything, and to be rid of the desires. 

The idea of becoming a girl or wishing I was a girl *never* hit me. If it ever had, I would likely hate myself because I would feel like less of a man for it. 

-------------------

So on went the years of repression and crossdressing outlets and sometimes bisexual encounters but I did really like girls. 

I think mostly, I was obsessed with how other people perceived me, and being validated by them. I wanted so badly to be loved and accepted and I knew inside that I felt like a monster. I hated myself, and felt disgusted with myself. I learned to hate who I was, and what I was, whatever that may have been. 

I tried so hard to be a man. And never felt like I was one. 

I had feminine expressions, emotions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, aesthetics (regardless of whether some of this can be gendered, I believed they were feminine). Over time I became more comfortable with holding these, but I did my best to hide them, and be as much a man on the outside as I could.

This meant that things like manboobs were a huge source of shame for me, because to me they made me a girl. And I was trying my hardest to just be a man. 

------------------

At the age of 20, with the help of psychedelics, I spoke the words for the first time ever, and it was the first time the feeling ever had a label or a name. ""I wish I was born a girl"". 

But I became terrified of this, and ashamed once more, and repressed it for another 8 years of much the same behavior, and completely ""forgot"" my realization. 

-----------------

A couple months ago, the realization came back after months and months of random thoughts of wishing I could look like this girl, or act like that girl, or be that girl, etc. 

I came out as transgender, and began my transition on HRT almost 4 weeks ago.

That brings me to now. I question my identity *every single day*. I do have ADHD, and anxiety disorder of some form. Obsessive anxious thoughts are pretty much the norm for me. 

I don't have that internal piece that allows me to say ""This is what I am"". I have zero confidence in my identity. 

I feel like I am not a man. I *want* to be a girl. I *want* to have been born with the right brain for being a girl. I *want* to be transgender. I *want* to transition to female. 

But no matter what I do, I can't convince myself internally that I am a girl. It just doesn't connect. 

Does this mean I am some form of nonbinary, or genderqueer? 

I don't fully understand. I just want to be able to know what I am, and move forward. I want a female body, and I want to present female, and I want to go by female pronouns (male pronouns SUCK for me, and gender neutral don't feel right at all). 

But despite that, I feel as though I will never feel like a real girl internally.

I wanted so badly to be loved and accepted and I knew inside that I felt like a monster. I hated myself, and felt disgusted with myself. I learned to hate who I was, and what I was, whatever that may have been. \n\nI tried so hard to be a man. And never felt like I was one. \n\nI had feminine expressions, emotions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, aesthetics (regardless of whether some of this can be gendered, I believed they were feminine). Over time I became more comfortable with holding these, but I did my best to hide them, and be as much a man on the outside as I could.\n\nThis meant that things like manboobs were a huge source of shame for me, because to me they made me a girl. And I was trying my hardest to just be a man. \n\n------------------\n\nAt the age of 20, with the help of psychedelics, I spoke the words for the first time ever, and it was the first time the feeling ever had a label or a name. ""I wish I was born a girl"". \n\nBut I became terrified of this, and ashamed once more, and repressed it for another 8 years of much the same behavior, and completely ""forgot"" my realization. \n\n-----------------\n\nA couple months ago, the realization came back after months and months of random thoughts of wishing I could look like this girl, or act like that girl, or be that girl, etc. \n\nI came out as transgender, and began my transition on HRT almost 4 weeks ago.\n\nThat brings me to now. I question my identity *every single day*. I do have ADHD, and anxiety disorder of some form. Obsessive anxious thoughts are pretty much the norm for me. \n\nI don\'t have that internal piece that allows me to say ""This is what I am"". I have zero confidence in my identity. \n\nI feel like I am not a man. I *want* to be a girl. I *want* to have been born with the right brain for being a girl. I *want* to be transgender. I *want* to transition to female. \n\nBut no matter what I do, I can\'t convince myself internally that I am a girl. It just doesn\'t connect. \n\nDoes this mean I am some form of nonbinary, or genderqueer? \n\nI don\'t fully understand. I just want to be able to know what I am, and move forward. I want a female body, and I want to present female, and I want to go by female pronouns (male pronouns SUCK for me, and gender neutral don\'t feel right at all). \n\nBut despite that, I feel as though I will never feel like a real girl internally.

Right now I identify as gynesexual (attracted to women) and agender (not identifying with any gender at all)

I'm AFAB and when I was younger, around 13, I started feeling that I wasn't supposed to be a girl. Untill then, my body hadn't really developed that much and I had figured that when it did, it would feel great and natural. But when my body actually did change, it felt wrong. Having breats felt so weird and unnatural. 

I searched for answers, and eventually came upon a conclusion that I was trans. I felt so happy to have something that validated my feelings. I told my friends, and they were completly supportive. They called me by my preferred pronouns and my preferred name, and it was great. Then one day, my parents got a call from my school, where I had trying to get the teachers to call me by my preffered name. I hadn't been makinga big deal of it, I just casually mentioned during roll call, and most of them rolled with it. I still don't know which teacher called my parents. 

When my parents found out, they also searched my computer and found the messages i had sent to my friends. When i got home from school, my parents sat me down and questioned me, so I was forced to come out as trans, They didn't take it well. My mom thought I was trying to punish her, and she started yelling and crying while my dad stood in the back, not saying anything. A couple weeks later I tried to commit suicide, and failed. When my parents found the cuts on my arms, they sent me to a mental health hospitak, where I was treated using a combination of medication and therapy for clinical depression. Im much better now and wouldn't ever considering taking my own life ever again.

However, with the passing of my mental illness, my parents also assumed that I no longer identified as trans. They just think Im a lesbian who had been in denial. We dont talk about who I date, we dont talk about my sexual orientation, we ignore any part of that aspect of my life. We deny that I ever came out.

 I know I am only sexually attracted to women, but I still struggle with my gender idnetity. I realised that not only did I not identify as female, I also did not idneitfy as male. I had just latched onto the transman idea because it seemed the most accesible to me at the time. Now I realise that I don't identify as any gender. I found the term agender and I think that that is perfectly how I feel, but I still keep and open mind. I am only a teenager, I still have time to explore.

I told my friends, and like last time, they accepted me. They use my preferred pronouns (they) and my preffered name. But I still feel invalid.

To eveyone except my parents, I am fully out and proud about my sexual orientation.  I do not hide the fact that i like girls from anyone at school, and i take no crap for it, and i am supported, which is nice. But i also wish the other part of my identify could be supported as well.

At school, everyone uses my female name and calls me ""she and I hate it. I hate it so much. I have become so uncomfortable with my body and being called ""she"" only furthers this. I am comfortable with havinga vagina, but having breasts makes me almost break out in tears every time I see them. I wear a sports bra during the day, sometimes two if I dont think my mom will see, and in the shower I always look up, so i won't have to see them. I feel so uncomfortable being called she. i am not a she. I am not a he. It shouldn't be that hard to understand.

I am too afraid to tell anyone at school, and telling my parents is out of the question, my school does have a GSA,but Im not sure if even they will understand. Im so afraid of being invalidated. To make matters worse, one of the girls in GSA was in the same hosptial as I was when I still identified as trans. What if she thinks I just trying to be ""special"" by having a different gender identity. What if she doesn't understand. What if nobody understands. I feel like i can't really express how i feel to my friends, because they aren't genderqueer. We can relate about sexual orientation stuff because both of them are bi, but I feel like they wouldnt be able to empathize with my gender stuff.

I never bring uo my gender identify. Im not allowed to express it. My mother forbjds me from getting short hair, because when I had short hair, everyone I met assumed I was male based on my overall appearance, which I was fine with, but my mom didn't like at all. I can't shop in the male section of stores, because my mom wont let me. When I wore a suit instead of a dress to my 8th grade promotion dance, my mom started crying, and later she tried to guilt me into wearing a dress. I wore a suit. I looked great, I manage to pull off a pretty gender neutral look bh wearing baggy jeans and unisex tshirts, but its not the same. My identity is invalidated everyday, and I am too afraid to try and change that. I just want someone to understand. My body feels wrong. My appearance feels wrong. I feel wrong.

Right now, those are the three/four things I would consider myself, if I actually think about my gender identity, which isn't too often these days. I'm biologically male, look masculine and as far as anyone knows I'm a straight, white male - the white is the only thing that is for sure. Sometimes I feel like a fraud because I don't have to deal with the same kind of feelings, the same dysphoria, that many on this subreddit and related subreddits feel and have to deal with.

That being said, I'm not the most masculine of men - if I really showed more of my personality to others (I'm a very introverted person), I would certainly be seen as much more gender neutral in personality. I want to be able to have longer hair (I love my dark hair - I hate when sunlight lightens it even slightly - and I love the contrast it has with my fair skin and blue eyes), I want to be able to wear skirts, I want to not have to be seen as a ""man"" but just as a human. I guess I should point out that I was born with certain genetic problems that meant I can't produce a lot of testosterone, and so I need to use a gel every day. Thankfully, this has meant that I'm not too hairy, although I would prefer to have no hair at all on my arms, legs, chest, back and bottom (my arse is way too hairy), plus I like to keep clean-shaven.

I certainly have had sexual fantasies about being a woman, or at least having a feminine body, and being overweight means that my moobs have been useful when pleasuring myself, which isn't a very regular occurrence by anyone's standards. I'm 5 foot 9 (thankfully, as I would hate to be much taller than this) and trying to lose weight enough to reach 155lbs - I like how I can see more of my bones now and I love having a smaller waist, but the high cheekbones I hoped my facial flab was hiding don't seem to be there. My hips feel like they jut out more than they used to as well.

I have some memories of myself as a child imagining myself to be a girl, although these are very rare incidents and they seem to have happened when I was about eight or nine.

Alex isn't my real name, my real name is far more masculine, but I love the name and it's suitably gender neutral (which is probably why it seems so popular in these kind of communities).

I think a perfect world for me would be one where I could be comfortably gender neutral, where I could wear a skirt or jeans depending on what I felt like wearing (I sort of like the idea of black and magenta clothing when it comes to a skirt and t-shirt), where I could have my hair down to my shoulders, but at the same time I'm not someone who likes jewellery, and things like fashion bore me. I prefer reading over playing sports (although I like to go for walks and I love to watch football/soccer), and I would have no problem being a stay at home parent/partner - I strongly believe in sharing housework in a way that is best for both/all partners involved.

I like the idea of being submissive in a relationship, I'm not a very dominant person, but overall equality is vital.

Sorry if this seems like a rambling little story, but I wanted to share these things with you.

So it's been about 2 months since I started identifying as androgyne and confronting my gender identity. As I've been working on my expression my feelings toward anything masculine are starting to dissolve. Granted I've never really been that masculine a person apart from my physical shape, but now even those vague attachments seem even more tenuous. Getting ""sir""d over the phone at work is becoming irksome. I'm not a fucking sir.

I've been feeling morose as well. I'm not sure if it's dysphoria, longing for peace, or just feeling like I'm slowly going crazy. Last night I watched [Bad Sun's video for their song ""Salt""](http://planettransgender.com/bad-suns-mtv-video/) and it fucking winded me. The ending hit me like a punch to the gut. It's an amazing video, but a real heavy piece when you're not in the best place.

It dawns on me that while I entered into this adventure on the basis of identifying as androgyne, both male and female, everything I've done and anything that has felt rewarding has been associated with feeling more femme. I'm lost on if this is just because my psyche is getting the satisfaction of finally having more femme expression after years of masc dominance (and heavy masc expression leading up to 2 months ago), or if perhaps I am actually trans? Will things tip back and I'll long to feel more masc if I start expressing even more femme, or should I throw myself headlong into femme because really, what kind of man was I ever?

I am AMAB and have been undergoing medical MtF transition. I've made the decision to stop my transition for now for personal reasons and stop my MtF hormone therapy (Antiandrogen + Estrogen) after a little over 2 months. I have a few questions for anyone with experience coming off hormones.


Two things worry me:

1) Will my body jump start masculinization it never had pre-HRT? I was never too masculine despite being in my 20s so I guess it's kept my dysphoria from altogether exploding on me. I don't think I could handle if I stop HRT and my body overcompensates and I heavily masculinize as a result of stopping HRT. 

2) Will cross-gender hormone therapy not work if I restart it a year or two down the road? Will it be as effective? I've heard anecdotes that stopping HRT after being on it for several months basically burns out your endocrine system's ability to react to HRT in the future?

For anyone that's come on/off and then on again, how were the results the second time around? Did your body go back to pre-HRT masculinization after coming off, or did it become more masculine? Did restarting HRT have the same effect as the first time around?

I hope to restart my transition some time in the future but I'm not honestly 100% on it. At the same time if I knew that stopping now would make transitioning impossible, I might just keep going.

I have been seeing a psychologist for the last 5 months about various issues. (btw if you ever feel for a second that you think you should go... it's totally worth it.) One of the issues I went over was gender identity. First of all it's still an ongoing process and I am continuing onto a better place mentally. So first of all I'm not really sure where I land on the identity spectrum so I can't really comment on that, but I feel that whatever I am or aren't, I just don't feel a need to come out to anyone about it.

I'm just wondering what everyone else's thoughts were about this. I realize a part of this may be that I don't particularity care about pronouns or anything, and if I happened to be presenting female at the time I wouldn't be that upset if I was misgendered at the time. I can understand telling the people who's lives are directly affected by you (family and SO) but for the most part it just seems like it's making life harder than it should.

I am kind of new to this and very much in the closet. Or publicly speaking, my closer friends know. Or, I don't hide that I'm bi but, it's complicated... I'm in my early 20's, 2-3 years ago I was depressed and my first happy memory was finding Andrej Pejic (as she was named at that point, I still love her and great for the trans-community she transitioned, but I loved her a little more before as a genderqueer). After that I had these phases of just ""fuck it, today I'm walking around in a skirt or even a dress"" for myself on the street, which was great but in retrospective I sort of looked like a maniac (no mean to offend anyone) and now I more want to actually develop a style and pull it off (more or less) instead of just going around in whatever (in public). During this period I never happened to bump into anyone I know (so I think).

I'm hoping of starting to move towards feminizing my style more and more, I already have in many ways, but often I get stuck in these paradoxes. First of all, some clothes that a girl can have in school as a sort of chill outfit, can on me start to feel like I'm over dressed, since girls clothes is a little bit more fancy at times. I hate that. And also to be able to walk out the door in a more dared style require of me that I'm in a great confident mood, otherwise I won't pull it off (getting warm, insecure, feel like crying on the toilet by peoples glances). Some outfits I liked for a while can suddenly make me feel disgusting as well (mostly it's the shoulders, hand and feet), which is absurd because I want to be androgynous and I find myself good looking and I know I am, I'm very lucky having that, it would be much harder without it. Then I seattle for something safe and more male and it looks good, but (sometimes) makes me really unhappy since it isn't me, and I just keep on feeding new people I meet with the wrong picture of me. Or wrong and wrong... Sometimes weeks go by and I'm happy expressing myself within the cis-boarders and then I get months of thinking it feels wrong every single day... I started growing my hair longer now, it touches my shoulders and I feel like crying out of happiness I'm finally letting it grow, but then I'm scared I wake up looking like an 80's metal musician or something terrible very unfeminine...

And then, I met this girl... She hasn't experienced much of my feminine sides, some clothing, but I'm a musician/artistic in general so I think the cliché artists dresses a little different haven't had her thinking about that I'm bi/(wishing to become more) genderqueer. But I could be wrong, I shave my legs/underarms/dick, she's seen the beauty-products in my bathroom (which doesn't need to prove anything, but straight girls I've been with before has noticed these things). Now I live abroad for a year and I only see her twice a month at best, I really like her and I made up my mind the other night (so I hope, but I doubt a lot) to be honest with her and dress and be the way I am, but I get caught up in these things... Being with a straight girl before usually makes me a little bit more straight, since the way I express my gender is fluid, so a lot of the time I really don't know how to dress when I see her and now I see her so rarely. I actually met her one week before I moved away, which is crazy and it's very unlike both of us to start a long distance relationship with that as a base, which speaks a lot how much we like each other (even though it's a naive newly in love won't probably hold in the long run-thing). Three months has gone now since I met her. She has depression and anxiety, which she told me about, and I've had that too so we've talked of those sort of things (but I kept quiet about the gender-things...). She's very fragile, and I'm afraid of putting her through some extra stress now, since I can be male a lot of the time too... She's different though, fits me great in that way, she's so good looking I find myself daydreaming I was her at times.

With my ex-girlfriend, who was very queer (bless her!) I tried pegging ([Fun Factory &lt;3](https://www.funfactory.com/en/dildos/share/)) for the first time and loved it (when we broke up she said ""Good luck being with a straight girl after this"" which sort of haunts me at times..). Hoping I could experience pegging with this girl too… Even though she wouldn't be into it it's just a category of sex for me, like a blow job etc. I can live without it if she's not into it, sex must be mutual, but I'm just scared mentioning it will make her think I really want to be with a man (some straight girls think this about bisexuality, I've been with men, that's not a problem, I'm with her now and want no one else).

My question is can anybody relate to this? What would you suggest to do from this point?

**TL;DR** Not sure how to start to express myself publicly, met a girl that doesn't know I'm genderqueer, would like to hear if someone can relate, give some input/insight into this.

Or publicly speaking, my closer friends know. Or, I don\'t hide that I\'m bi but, it\'s complicated... I\'m in my early 20\'s, 2-3 years ago I was depressed and my first happy memory was finding Andrej Pejic (as she was named at that point, I still love her and great for the trans-community she transitioned, but I loved her a little more before as a genderqueer). After that I had these phases of just ""fuck it, today I\'m walking around in a skirt or even a dress"" for myself on the street, which was great but in retrospective I sort of looked like a maniac (no mean to offend anyone) and now I more want to actually develop a style and pull it off (more or less) instead of just going around in whatever (in public). During this period I never happened to bump into anyone I know (so I think).\n\nI\'m hoping of starting to move towards feminizing my style more and more, I already have in many ways, but often I get stuck in these paradoxes. First of all, some clothes that a girl can have in school as a sort of chill outfit, can on me start to feel like I\'m over dressed, since girls clothes is a little bit more fancy at times. I hate that. And also to be able to walk out the door in a more dared style require of me that I\'m in a great confident mood, otherwise I won\'t pull it off (getting warm, insecure, feel like crying on the toilet by peoples glances). Some outfits I liked for a while can suddenly make me feel disgusting as well (mostly it\'s the shoulders, hand and feet), which is absurd because I want to be androgynous and I find myself good looking and I know I am, I\'m very lucky having that, it would be much harder without it. Then I seattle for something safe and more male and it looks good, but (sometimes) makes me really unhappy since it isn\'t me, and I just keep on feeding new people I meet with the wrong picture of me. Or wrong and wrong... Sometimes weeks go by and I\'m happy expressing myself within the cis-boarders and then I get months of thinking it feels wrong every single day... I started growing my hair longer now, it touches my shoulders and I feel like crying out of happiness I\'m finally letting it grow, but then I\'m scared I wake up looking like an 80\'s metal musician or something terrible very unfeminine...\n\nAnd then, I met this girl... She hasn\'t experienced much of my feminine sides, some clothing, but I\'m a musician/artistic in general so I think the cliché artists dresses a little different haven\'t had her thinking about that I\'m bi/(wishing to become more) genderqueer. But I could be wrong, I shave my legs/underarms/dick, she\'s seen the beauty-products in my bathroom (which doesn\'t need to prove anything, but straight girls I\'ve been with before has noticed these things).

Hi all, I came here since researching hasn't come up with much. Mainly since I have no idea what to even search for. This may be long. I will try and make it easy to read and there will be a TD;LR.

I identify as a lesbian, I am married to a woman as well. I am biologically a female. Although, I dress very masculine. I feel naked if I am not wearing boxers or mens clothes. I cannot even bring myself to wear anything that shows my chest.

The weird part is that sometimes I don't mind it. Once every few months I will want to wear slightly feminine clothes, like tank tops and cardigans. The urge leaves almost as soon as it comes. Then the idea of wearing those clothes isn't even a thought.

People often mistake me for a man. I am young and am often accused of having a fake ID or they comment on my female name. I just play the part and act as if I was male. I say it's because I am saving them the embarrassment of thinking I was a male. I am starting to wonder if it's true, wondering if thats the reason i do it. It feels pretty damn good when i am thought of as a guy. It sometimes feels like a victory, sometimes it doesn't (generally based on how they act)

In bed I always want to use a strap-on. I feel defeated if my wife isn't feeling it that day (she is bisexual so it isnt often). I like when she touches it even if i can't feel it. I also feel uncomfortable in ""feminine"" positions in bed.

On top of this I am fine calling myself a woman. I don't feel like I have dysphoria, although i am not completely sure what it entails. I also couldn't imagine getting surgery on my downstairs region

I will try and make it easy to read and there will be a TD;LR.\n\nI identify as a lesbian, I am married to a woman as well. I am biologically a female. Although, I dress very masculine. I feel naked if I am not wearing boxers or mens clothes. I cannot even bring myself to wear anything that shows my chest.\n\nThe weird part is that sometimes I don\'t mind it. Once every few months I will want to wear slightly feminine clothes, like tank tops and cardigans. The urge leaves almost as soon as it comes. Then the idea of wearing those clothes isn\'t even a thought.\n\nPeople often mistake me for a man. I am young and am often accused of having a fake ID or they comment on my female name. I just play the part and act as if I was male. I say it\'s because I am saving them the embarrassment of thinking I was a male. I am starting to wonder if it\'s true, wondering if thats the reason i do it. It feels pretty damn good when i am thought of as a guy. It sometimes feels like a victory, sometimes it doesn\'t (generally based on how they act)\n\nIn bed I always want to use a strap-on. I feel defeated if my wife isn\'t feeling it that day (she is bisexual so it isnt often). I like when she touches it even if i can\'t feel it. I also feel uncomfortable in ""feminine"" positions in bed.\n\nOn top of this I am fine calling myself a woman. I don\'t feel like I have dysphoria, although i am not completely sure what it entails.

I started on T three days ago and at first I was fucking ecstatic, I was so happy I cried and I just felt an all around sense of calm, etc. I felt amazing. Then when I was in the shower yesterday I realized my junk looked a little different and I had a panic attack, mainly because I was shocked that things were already changing, etc. I have horrible anxiety and I get super overwhelmed by things that are out of my control so I should have expected that to happen. I talked to my friend to calm down and they said ""You may very well be imagining it since you just started"" and I thought maybe they were right but low and behold, I woke up this morning and my junk is definitely without a doubt not the same as it was before my shot, and for some reason I feel like total shit. I never really had bottom dysphoria to this degree before, I mean I was disgusted by my ""vagina"" to the point of hardly ever doing anything sexual with partners etc. but for some reason my genitals getting BIGGER has made me feel fucking terrible. I'm now hyper aware of the fact that I have a vagina and a clitoris and it's kind of left me feeling like ""It doesn't matter what you do, you will never be a man."" and it's truly awful. I'm crying just writing that. I just have a clitoris that's getting bigger and what's weird is I wanted that, that was something I was really excited for, but now I just feel like a man with a swollen vagina.

This all leads to one major worry: what if I made all of this up in my head? Sometimes I have major melt-downs worrying that I am making up being trans*, but the fact that these feelings always come up after horrible episodes of dysphoria brings me to believe that it might just be a means of self-preservation, almost like my brain saying ""IF YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF YOU'RE NOT TRANS* AND STOP IDENTIFYING AS MALE EVEN FOR A LITTLE BIT IT WILL STOP THE BAD FEELINGS, PLEASE JUST BE IN DENIAL FOR A LITTLE BIT!"" but I always come right back to feeling male, presenting that way, etc. It's like feeling male is my default and reverting to presenting as female for short periods of time is a way to shut up the dysphoria in any way I can. So of course having WORSE dysphoria three days into t is making my brain go ""HOLY SHIT WHAT IF YOU AREN'T ACTUALLY TRANS* AND JUST MADE IT ALL UP IN YOUR HEAD, WHAT IF YOU FEEL HORRIBLE ABOUT YOUR JUNK INCREASING IN SIZE BECAUSE YOU ARE ACTUALLY A WOMAN.""

##Warping the gender

####[Introduction]

It feels quite safe to say in 2014 that the man/woman strict gender duality is
an old-fashioned idea. Society (at least from some broad point of view) got
accustomed to any kind of shades, variations, transgenderisms. But the word
transgender still means going from one side to the other among two. Transition-
ing FTM or MTF implies that you are on one bank of the river and want to pass
to the other bank. 

And thus, even if we found a ford and intermediate steps
on emerging stone are allowed, the duality is still present. In the questionable
picture in which men and women are the two extrema of a segment, the idea of a
standard, normal man/woman has relatively little changed in hum#an history. In
modern history feminism helped a lot to put the woman side of the segment at
an equal level to the man one in terms of principles, rights, worth. But even the
most modern idea of a woman lacks of certain features that the human species
is starting to sport. It is time to make the leap and start to accept a further
more evolved idea of gender. 

What follows is the trans-woman manifesto, where
trans does not mean going from female to male but instead means going beyond
the traditional gender features of the species. In this sense a better word to
describe it would perhaps be trans-human. A very similar manifesto could be
written from a man’s point of view, going beyond the borders of male gender.
Let us leave it to others. Here we focus on a fictional character named Adamah:
in the modern society’s eye and words she’s a straight woman with some strange
ideas. In reality she’s trans-human as we shall describe.

####[The manifesto]

Adamah is a female. Undeniably. She has female sexual characters and feels
generally comfortable with them. She sure would not prefer to be a man. Never
thought for a second that it would be better to grow a penis. But there are
certain features of the standard femaleness that she dislikes. She wants her
body to be slim, muscled, sharp. She wants to be strong, agile and quick. The
soft and round stereotype of the motherly woman does not fit her, nor the soft
and round one of sexy babe, nor the one of weak skinny models. Not that any
kind of body-type has something bad or wrong in principle. She just made the
choice to have body with certain features instead of others.

Adamah does not want to have children. Nope. No thanks. She does not
want to be a mother, to generate and share her body for a while with another
creature. And then be a parent. She is not at all interested in this part of the
“femaleness”. As a consequence, she technically does not need the part of body
plumbery related solely to reproduction. Basically the female stuff which is not
involved in sexual pleasure is useless from her point of view. Quick example:
boobs→useful, ovaries→useless. So, when her very sporty lifestyle and food
habits led to the slow desappearance of her menses she quickly shrugged off an
initial tip of concern and she welcomed the new setup with a sense of joy and
relief. Being female without the bother of a monthly useless recurrence seems
to her like a great deal.

She likes the idea of being able to control her body with habits, especially
the nutritional ones. The body is like a piece of hardware in some sense and like
programmers we can just run with the default settings or modify them through
new software, hacks, scripts, code snippets. She knows that this could be like
playing with fire, that it can be dangerous and unhealthy. But a lot of things
are. And it is not so hard to stay on the right track and not fall into the abyss:
it is all a matter of finding your own balance and staying rational. Basically, all
you need is love for yourself. Which we as human usually have plenty of.
So she claims the freedom to manipulate her body and be a different kind
of a woman than the standard one. She enjoys her heterosexual sex habits. She
welcomes physical transformations by discipline and training, instead than pills-
induced. She does not want to be less feminine to become more masculine. Not
interested in going on T and grow a beard. But for sure she is less female than
the percentage required to the standard femaleness to which we are accustomed.
At the end of the day, of course, she does not give a shit about labels, she is
primarily and most of all herself.",genderqueer,what do you think of this gender warping story?,1417145092.0,"{'created_utc': 1417119892, 'id': '2nluj5', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '###A post-woman manifesto\n##Warping the gender\n\n####[Introduction]\n\nIt feels quite safe to say in 2014 that the man/woman strict gender duality is\nan old-fashioned idea.

So I definitely have body dysphoria, also since puberty I had felt so depressed, and after 4 months of hormone replacement I feel amazing, do I know I have hormonal dysphoria. So basically in that sense I want a 'female' body, but at the same time I have absolutely no ill will towards my genitals in there current state, I want to leave them as is, and I really don't want GRS. 

So anyways, about a month and a half ago I cameout and went full time as a trans woman, and heres the thing, the best part about it is I feel more free to express myself in a lot of ways, but at the same time I find if I do anything too stereotypically ""male"" it puts my gender into question. I kinda feel like ive just jumped into another set of expectations, one that albeit does fit me better, isn't perfect. 

Some day I wake up and I really want to present butch for that day, most of the time I feel femme, but I don't really feel like a ""woman"", I just feel like a person who feels comfortable with an estrogen dominant body. I just want to be myself. Sure I am pretty femme in a lot of ways, but I want the freedom to just act however I feel and not have to worry about whether I appear female or not.

Recently, I've been spending a lot of time thrifting, and discovered that a lot of womens wear gets mixed in with the mens wear and vice versa.  I realized that store clerks -- both male and female -- frequently ""misidentify"" certain items of clothing with greater frequency than others.

Wonderful lambswool/cashmere sweaters from Gap, Banana Republic, and Lands' End in both mens and womens cuts seem to have a lot of overlap, and work whether one is in boymode, girlmode, both or neithermode.

Some styles of Christopher &amp; Banks womens pants and Express mens pants look nearly identical, except for the cut. Khaki and gray herringbone Lee Riders for women are styled like mens pants, but have an awesome feminine fit (on me anyway).

Some H&amp;M finds from the mens section look entirely like womens styles in cut, fabric, and style -- but the tags say ""mens"" (which is the only mens part about them, really).

Buttonups of all sorts with wider cuffs and slimmer/modern cuts -- with and without spandex -- are also all over the place, and sometimes the m/f button sides are reversed despite what the tags say.

**So, r/genderqueer: What are your favorite genderqueer/agender/androgynous items or styles of clothing?**

I'm currently in my last year of undergraduate education, and after that, i'm off to grad school. I've been transitioning for 2 and a half years, and luckily was able to pull off living full time as soon as i started transitioning thanks to my pre-hrt androgynous boy body.  As a child i would be mistaken for a girl all the time, and though it used to frustrate my parents, it made my heart flutter in secrecy because people were seeing me for the girl i knew i was at heart. I don't want to go in to a full blown autobiography because i sure as hell know i wouldn't want to read such a long passage. I digress to my original question and concern. Have any of you guys rejected a girl in the past that you liked when she told you she was transgender? I am lucky enough that i get approached by men, but i am always honest and tell them up front that i'm trans. Not all of them are repelled by it, but i would say that at least 80-90% of them can't deal with such a debilitating fact( at least to them it is), and they tell me that they aren't gay and never talk to me again. Why are guys so worried about labels when it comes to who they are attracted to. They were initially attracted to me because they saw a girl, but when i told them about my past they didn't see me as a girl anymore(bummer, i know) and went on to tell me they aren't gay. 1) gay guys aren't attracted to girls, hence why i can't date gay men. 2) if there was a definitional term that described someone's romantic interest for transgender people, would they be more comfortable dating us, therfore not having to worry about being labeled gay? 3) why do guys have to care so much about a label so much that they reject an opportunity of love with someone they obviously find attractive and have chemistry with? I am not on  transgender dating sites for a couple of reasons: most of them just want me to fuck them in the ass ( which i guess falls under the fantasy category), they want me to keep my girly c**k, they live too far away, and there is a limited amount of men in my area.  In all honesty, i've had better success with men who weren't looking for a transchick, but they just happen to stumble upon yours truly. Where are the men who don't care about what society thinks about their personal romantic choices? Where are the men who aren't so focused on the GAY label. ugh! look at me! I'm a girl!! I currently have blonde hair at the moment, so the pics with blonde are most recent; including the one in the pirate costume that i took this past halloween night.

I'm at this point in my life totally dependant on my parents, as much as that sucks to admit. That's not a horrible place to be (I realize I get sooo many perks from this), and if that's what my ""problem"" was I wouldn't complain.

The issue is my parents are holding that authority over my head and are forcing me to be someone I'm not. I'm not even considering wearing clothing made with the female gender in mind, though I'd like to at least try it. It'd be horribly received. I've been told to man up more than a few times and my mom reinforces a lot of gender roles, with me and my siblings. I just don't feel like I can be the queer person I am without them threatening to pull the rug out from under me.

This whole post was sparked by an episode that I was initially hopeful about. At this time I have long hair for a 'guys cut' but I want to grow it out past that. It's really important to me. I want 'girls' hair, I want my hair longer. The longer my hair gets the more I love how I look. It's... I'm a person with long hair, but am forced to keep it short. I just recently went to get my hair cut, and made it /very/ clear I just want the lines cleaned up without cutting it much shorter if at all. My mom wasn't happy but agreed for ""this time"". Move on to getting my hair cut, the stylist was /awesome/ and supportive, and I loved the work she did. My mom on the other hand... didn't. She told me if I get my hair cut like that I have to pay for the haircuts. If I want to grow it out I have to pay for it. Fine, whatever, it's worth dipping into the small amount of money I have saved up for college and pay for the occasional hair-cut. It'd run me about 60$ a year if the cut is all I have to pay for. I took the deal instantly. 60$ a year to express my identity in regards to my hair? Fuck yeah, that'd be awesome. I was super excited. 

Aaand then she sits down with my dad, and they decide in less than a minute that it's their house and their rules, so I have to get it cut short next time. They didn't even ask me they just decided that if I'm going to get their support it comes with an imposed expresion of my gender. I don't feel safe to be me at home. I haven't for a while but I feel like they're getting even more restrictive with time, not less. The worst part is that it's my mother pushing this issue. The one who was fine with my being bi, the one who loves my trans girlfriend and goes beyond just tolerating her and wearing a smile. She's the one I look to for support on who I am, and she's the one imposing gender and gender roles on myself and my siblings (who to the best of my knowledge are cis, though my sister has touches of GQ in her that seem to go a touch beyond 'tomboy', but she hasn't said anything to me on it).

I don't feel safe expressing myself at home and my parents are forcing me into a presentation that I'm uncomfortable and slightly dysphoric with. I don't know what I can do, or if there is anything I /can/ do. I feel like my identity is being crushed by threatening me with their parental authority. Lots of ""not in my house"", ""I'm the parent so you have to just accept it"", ""when you move out you can [insert gender related deviation here], but not while you're living here"". I would move out if I could. Every time I try to make a stand for my identity or opinion they write me off and say that I have to conform to what they want because they're the parent. What they're really saying is if you do this you're not worthy of our support. I don't know what to do.

Sorry to vent, I just feel... trapped. I either be myself and lose the safety net I need to stay in college, or get forced into whatever arrangement my parents see fit, gender among them. I have no voice at home.

Help? Something? I don't know... I just needed this out there. I'm not sure there's anything anyone can do. :&lt;

30,2014-11-05 22:55:31,2leyi8,17,7,"Hi everyone, thought I would try to throw this one over here to see if I might get some help figuring out exactly what the hell I am. If you've seen any of my posts on askTG, then you know I struggle with this constantly. 

I can't seem to figure out what I am, and it causes me a lot of confusion and anxiety. 

I'll go into detail, because I don't want to leave any stone unturned I guess. Sorry if this is long. 

--------------

I'm MAAB, and ever since I was very young, I knew something was different about me, but I had no idea what. A lot of narratives have trans girls saying they knew from a young age they were supposed to be a girl. I didn't have the faintest idea of that, I just knew something was off. 

I had urges to crossdress as young as 5, I wanted to see myself in girl clothes sometimes. I saw my sisters putting on makeup when I was 9, and sorry about this weirdness, but it excited me and I guess was perfect timing for puberty because it became a fetish. 

I continued to crossdress only occasionally in my sister's clothes, and much more frequently I would play with their makeup, or sneak into my aunt's bathroom when we were at her house, to go through her makeup. It was definitely a fetish as it seemed sexually driven. 

I never knew that I might want to be a girl, it never clicked for me. In reality, I was deeply ashamed of these desires and tried my best to forget about them. My sisters made fun of me and I think I was so ashamed I just did my best to hide it and not do anything with it. 

The only thing I knew is that I didn't feel like much of a boy. I wanted to be a boy, but it felt like I just couldn't the way everyone else so easily was able to. 

At puberty, I developed a desire for boys. I had my first sexual experience with a boy, and was ashamed immediately after. I was especially ashamed of just how much I *loved* it. I went home and tried to pretend like it never happened. I didn't want to be gay. 

I would continue to have these fantasies, that the same boy would come over and I would dress up for him in my sister's clothes, and he would bend me over and pull up the skirt...etc. 

At the same time, I was deeply ashamed. I compartmentalized these desires and did my absolute best to be a ""man"". I tried so fucking hard. I felt like I wanted to be a man more than anything, and to be rid of the desires. 

The idea of becoming a girl or wishing I was a girl *never* hit me. If it ever had, I would likely hate myself because I would feel like less of a man for it. 

-------------------

So on went the years of repression and crossdressing outlets and sometimes bisexual encounters but I did really like girls. 

I think mostly, I was obsessed with how other people perceived me, and being validated by them. I wanted so badly to be loved and accepted and I knew inside that I felt like a monster. I hated myself, and felt disgusted with myself. I learned to hate who I was, and what I was, whatever that may have been. 

I tried so hard to be a man. And never felt like I was one. 

I had feminine expressions, emotions, feelings, ideas, beliefs, aesthetics (regardless of whether some of this can be gendered, I believed they were feminine). Over time I became more comfortable with holding these, but I did my best to hide them, and be as much a man on the outside as I could.

This meant that things like manboobs were a huge source of shame for me, because to me they made me a girl. And I was trying my hardest to just be a man. 

------------------

At the age of 20, with the help of psychedelics, I spoke the words for the first time ever, and it was the first time the feeling ever had a label or a name. ""I wish I was born a girl"". 

But I became terrified of this, and ashamed once more, and repressed it for another 8 years of much the same behavior, and completely ""forgot"" my realization. 

-----------------

A couple months ago, the realization came back after months and months of random thoughts of wishing I could look like this girl, or act like that girl, or be that girl, etc. 

I came out as transgender, and began my transition on HRT almost 4 weeks ago.

That brings me to now. I question my identity *every single day*. I do have ADHD, and anxiety disorder of some form. Obsessive anxious thoughts are pretty much the norm for me. 

I don't have that internal piece that allows me to say ""This is what I am"". I have zero confidence in my identity. 

I feel like I am not a man. I *want* to be a girl. I *want* to have been born with the right brain for being a girl. I *want* to be transgender. I *want* to transition to female. 

But no matter what I do, I can't convince myself internally that I am a girl. It just doesn't connect. 

Does this mean I am some form of nonbinary, or genderqueer? 

I don't fully understand. I just want to be able to know what I am, and move forward. I want a female body, and I want to present female, and I want to go by female pronouns (male pronouns SUCK for me, and gender neutral don't feel right at all). 

But despite that, I feel as though I will never feel like a real girl internally.

I'm very feminine, so I never planned on anything really changing. I just bought a binder, never intending to wear it around him because I knew it would make him uncomfortable. It was to be a compromise, and I was keeping his feelings in mind. But just the fact that I bought it is not going over well. He's upset, and he thinks I don't care about the marriage because I'm choosing to be comfortable with myself over being sexually attractive to him (which, as per above, is pretty invalid). I want to be loved for WHO I am, not what I am physically and what I look like. It feels like his love for me isn't genuine then. It's just misidentified lust.

Right now I identify as gynesexual (attracted to women) and agender (not identifying with any gender at all)

I'm AFAB and when I was younger, around 13, I started feeling that I wasn't supposed to be a girl. Untill then, my body hadn't really developed that much and I had figured that when it did, it would feel great and natural. But when my body actually did change, it felt wrong. Having breats felt so weird and unnatural. 

I searched for answers, and eventually came upon a conclusion that I was trans. I felt so happy to have something that validated my feelings. I told my friends, and they were completly supportive. They called me by my preferred pronouns and my preferred name, and it was great. Then one day, my parents got a call from my school, where I had trying to get the teachers to call me by my preffered name. I hadn't been makinga big deal of it, I just casually mentioned during roll call, and most of them rolled with it. I still don't know which teacher called my parents. 

When my parents found out, they also searched my computer and found the messages i had sent to my friends. When i got home from school, my parents sat me down and questioned me, so I was forced to come out as trans, They didn't take it well. My mom thought I was trying to punish her, and she started yelling and crying while my dad stood in the back, not saying anything. A couple weeks later I tried to commit suicide, and failed. When my parents found the cuts on my arms, they sent me to a mental health hospitak, where I was treated using a combination of medication and therapy for clinical depression. Im much better now and wouldn't ever considering taking my own life ever again.

However, with the passing of my mental illness, my parents also assumed that I no longer identified as trans. They just think Im a lesbian who had been in denial. We dont talk about who I date, we dont talk about my sexual orientation, we ignore any part of that aspect of my life. We deny that I ever came out.

 I know I am only sexually attracted to women, but I still struggle with my gender idnetity. I realised that not only did I not identify as female, I also did not idneitfy as male. I had just latched onto the transman idea because it seemed the most accesible to me at the time. Now I realise that I don't identify as any gender. I found the term agender and I think that that is perfectly how I feel, but I still keep and open mind. I am only a teenager, I still have time to explore.

I told my friends, and like last time, they accepted me. They use my preferred pronouns (they) and my preffered name. But I still feel invalid.

To eveyone except my parents, I am fully out and proud about my sexual orientation.  I do not hide the fact that i like girls from anyone at school, and i take no crap for it, and i am supported, which is nice. But i also wish the other part of my identify could be supported as well.

At school, everyone uses my female name and calls me ""she and I hate it. I hate it so much. I have become so uncomfortable with my body and being called ""she"" only furthers this. I am comfortable with havinga vagina, but having breasts makes me almost break out in tears every time I see them. I wear a sports bra during the day, sometimes two if I dont think my mom will see, and in the shower I always look up, so i won't have to see them. I feel so uncomfortable being called she. i am not a she. I am not a he. It shouldn't be that hard to understand.

I am too afraid to tell anyone at school, and telling my parents is out of the question, my school does have a GSA,but Im not sure if even they will understand. Im so afraid of being invalidated. To make matters worse, one of the girls in GSA was in the same hosptial as I was when I still identified as trans. What if she thinks I just trying to be ""special"" by having a different gender identity. What if she doesn't understand. What if nobody understands. I feel like i can't really express how i feel to my friends, because they aren't genderqueer. We can relate about sexual orientation stuff because both of them are bi, but I feel like they wouldnt be able to empathize with my gender stuff.

I never bring uo my gender identify. Im not allowed to express it. My mother forbjds me from getting short hair, because when I had short hair, everyone I met assumed I was male based on my overall appearance, which I was fine with, but my mom didn't like at all. I can't shop in the male section of stores, because my mom wont let me. When I wore a suit instead of a dress to my 8th grade promotion dance, my mom started crying, and later she tried to guilt me into wearing a dress. I wore a suit. I looked great, I manage to pull off a pretty gender neutral look bh wearing baggy jeans and unisex tshirts, but its not the same. My identity is invalidated everyday, and I am too afraid to try and change that. I just want someone to understand. My body feels wrong. My appearance feels wrong. I feel wrong.

100,2014-11-14 17:10:29,2mas6h,0,1,"Actually, my life ain't that bad since I've started hormones like 5 years ago. I finally feel like a human being, but I can't seem to cope with the fact that I missed out for so long, missed having a ""normal"" youth, missed having made sexual experiences and/ or having a relationship and so on.


I'm 35yrs old, ftm, gay...I started hormones when I was 30.

Until I turned 20 I had a nice bunch of friends, but was always the quiet one, enjoyed being around people but most times was minding my own business. 
I never really felt like a girl, but was not really familiar with the concept of transsexuality, so I thought that I'm just some sort of freak, a lovely one though.

I hardly had female friends back then and all my guy-friends treated me like one of their own....rumor started I'd be a lesbian (even though I never was interested in women)... I didn't care really, maybe I was a latebloomer, but I just wasn't really that interested in sex and relationship back then, I was pretty succesfull with sports and that was what I was doing in my free time.

After school I felt like I need to move away to get away from the life I was living and maybe find myself, I got a job in the music business and turned into a workaholic, I've worked up to 10-12hrs a day every day and going partying in my free time including all the alcohol and drug abuse that comes with it. 

I've made a cut with 25, quit my job and tried going to college but started struggeling with social phobia and depression, to an extent that I wasn't even able to pick up the phone when someone was calling. I was unemployed living from welfare for approx 5 years, I didn't have any contact to the outside world during that time, spending my days playing computer games, reading books, watching videos and sleeping. 

Life did get incredibly better since I started hormones and living as who I am: a pretty laid-back, educated, polite and fun guy to hang round with.


I'm 35 and I look like a teenager due to the fact I'm super small and slim (168cm, ~55kg) and I feel like I'm 20 just finished school and gonna start over with my life now....and it feels like I don't fit in anywhere really.
I mean, I'm actually a happy person when I'm all for myself but whenever I'm around people...I'm stressed.
I don't get along with people my age really as I feel somewhat inferior to them what has a lot to do with my physical specs I think, but also because I just never really have worked in my life so far or had a relationship and such. Also: most people my age just live a whole different life and I don't even know if I ever turn that way.
On the other hand: onn college I don't really want to hang out with those kids either as most of them are just ...""kids"", they're in their 20's and 15 years can make a hell of a difference.
I have a lot of people around me but I really don't feel like I enjoy being around them
I'd consider myself to have 1 friend, she's my best triend since like 15 years and the only person I still have contact with from pre-transition times. 

As for relationships and sex:
I'd love to have that but I'm super insecure and ashamed of not having ANY experience. Given the fact I'm ftm doesn't make things easier to explain to people. 

All of this is draining (or already has drained) all life energy from me and I'm super afraid of failing college as I'm just getting more and more lazy and start retreating from social life again (but only because I don't really find people I really enjoy hanging around with), I can't find motivation to go to lectures, read books, study and so on.

Actually, my life really ain't that bad, I just don't know how to deal with the fact I've lost so many years and failed to make so many experiences in the past.

I didn\'t care really, maybe I was a latebloomer, but I just wasn\'t really that interested in sex and relationship back then, I was pretty succesfull with sports and that was what I was doing in my free time.\n\nAfter school I felt like I need to move away to get away from the life I was living and maybe find myself, I got a job in the music business and turned into a workaholic, I\'ve worked up to 10-12hrs a day every day and going partying in my free time including all the alcohol and drug abuse that comes with it. \n\nI\'ve made a cut with 25, quit my job and tried going to college but started struggeling with social phobia and depression, to an extent that I wasn\'t even able to pick up the phone when someone was calling. I was unemployed living from welfare for approx 5 years, I didn\'t have any contact to the outside world during that time, spending my days playing computer games, reading books, watching videos and sleeping. \n\nLife did get incredibly better since I started hormones and living as who I am: a pretty laid-back, educated, polite and fun guy to hang round with.\n\n\nI\'m 35 and I look like a teenager due to the fact I\'m super small and slim (168cm, ~55kg) and I feel like I\'m 20 just finished school and gonna start over with my life now....and it feels like I don\'t fit in anywhere really.\nI mean, I\'m actually a happy person when I\'m all for myself but whenever I\'m around people...I\'m stressed.\nI don\'t get along with people my age really as I feel somewhat inferior to them what has a lot to do with my physical specs I think, but also because I just never really have worked in my life so far or had a relationship and such. Also: most people my age just live a whole different life and I don\'t even know if I ever turn that way.\nOn the other hand: onn college I don\'t really want to hang out with those kids either as most of them are just ...""kids"", they\'re in their 20\'s and 15 years can make a hell of a difference.\nI have a lot of people around me but I really don\'t feel like I enjoy being around them\nI\'d consider myself to have 1 friend, she\'s my best triend since like 15 years and the only person I still have contact with from pre-transition times. \n\nAs for relationships and sex:\nI\'d love to have that but I\'m super insecure and ashamed of not having ANY experience. Given the fact I\'m ftm doesn\'t make things easier to explain to people. \n\nAll of this is draining (or already has drained) all life energy from me and I\'m super afraid of failing college as I\'m just getting more and more lazy and start retreating from social life again (but only because I don\'t really find people I really enjoy hanging around with), I can\'t find motivation to go to lectures, read books, study and so on.\n\nActually, my life really ain\'t that bad, I just don\'t know how to deal with the fact I\'ve lost so many years and failed to make so many experiences in the past.\n', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Got hit by depression big time.

I was born a male and I guess I identify as a male and dress as a male because it feels like that's what I am supposed to do. I've never worn women's clothing nor do I have the money to try it now.

Right now, those are the three/four things I would consider myself, if I actually think about my gender identity, which isn't too often these days. I'm biologically male, look masculine and as far as anyone knows I'm a straight, white male - the white is the only thing that is for sure. Sometimes I feel like a fraud because I don't have to deal with the same kind of feelings, the same dysphoria, that many on this subreddit and related subreddits feel and have to deal with.

That being said, I'm not the most masculine of men - if I really showed more of my personality to others (I'm a very introverted person), I would certainly be seen as much more gender neutral in personality. I want to be able to have longer hair (I love my dark hair - I hate when sunlight lightens it even slightly - and I love the contrast it has with my fair skin and blue eyes), I want to be able to wear skirts, I want to not have to be seen as a ""man"" but just as a human. I guess I should point out that I was born with certain genetic problems that meant I can't produce a lot of testosterone, and so I need to use a gel every day. Thankfully, this has meant that I'm not too hairy, although I would prefer to have no hair at all on my arms, legs, chest, back and bottom (my arse is way too hairy), plus I like to keep clean-shaven.

I certainly have had sexual fantasies about being a woman, or at least having a feminine body, and being overweight means that my moobs have been useful when pleasuring myself, which isn't a very regular occurrence by anyone's standards. I'm 5 foot 9 (thankfully, as I would hate to be much taller than this) and trying to lose weight enough to reach 155lbs - I like how I can see more of my bones now and I love having a smaller waist, but the high cheekbones I hoped my facial flab was hiding don't seem to be there. My hips feel like they jut out more than they used to as well.

I have some memories of myself as a child imagining myself to be a girl, although these are very rare incidents and they seem to have happened when I was about eight or nine.

Alex isn't my real name, my real name is far more masculine, but I love the name and it's suitably gender neutral (which is probably why it seems so popular in these kind of communities).

I think a perfect world for me would be one where I could be comfortably gender neutral, where I could wear a skirt or jeans depending on what I felt like wearing (I sort of like the idea of black and magenta clothing when it comes to a skirt and t-shirt), where I could have my hair down to my shoulders, but at the same time I'm not someone who likes jewellery, and things like fashion bore me. I prefer reading over playing sports (although I like to go for walks and I love to watch football/soccer), and I would have no problem being a stay at home parent/partner - I strongly believe in sharing housework in a way that is best for both/all partners involved.

I like the idea of being submissive in a relationship, I'm not a very dominant person, but overall equality is vital.

Sorry if this seems like a rambling little story, but I wanted to share these things with you.

So it's been about 2 months since I started identifying as androgyne and confronting my gender identity. As I've been working on my expression my feelings toward anything masculine are starting to dissolve. Granted I've never really been that masculine a person apart from my physical shape, but now even those vague attachments seem even more tenuous. Getting ""sir""d over the phone at work is becoming irksome. I'm not a fucking sir.

I've been feeling morose as well. I'm not sure if it's dysphoria, longing for peace, or just feeling like I'm slowly going crazy. Last night I watched [Bad Sun's video for their song ""Salt""](http://planettransgender.com/bad-suns-mtv-video/) and it fucking winded me. The ending hit me like a punch to the gut. It's an amazing video, but a real heavy piece when you're not in the best place.

It dawns on me that while I entered into this adventure on the basis of identifying as androgyne, both male and female, everything I've done and anything that has felt rewarding has been associated with feeling more femme. I'm lost on if this is just because my psyche is getting the satisfaction of finally having more femme expression after years of masc dominance (and heavy masc expression leading up to 2 months ago), or if perhaps I am actually trans? Will things tip back and I'll long to feel more masc if I start expressing even more femme, or should I throw myself headlong into femme because really, what kind of man was I ever?

I am AMAB and have been undergoing medical MtF transition. I've made the decision to stop my transition for now for personal reasons and stop my MtF hormone therapy (Antiandrogen + Estrogen) after a little over 2 months. I have a few questions for anyone with experience coming off hormones.


Two things worry me:

1) Will my body jump start masculinization it never had pre-HRT? I was never too masculine despite being in my 20s so I guess it's kept my dysphoria from altogether exploding on me. I don't think I could handle if I stop HRT and my body overcompensates and I heavily masculinize as a result of stopping HRT. 

2) Will cross-gender hormone therapy not work if I restart it a year or two down the road? Will it be as effective? I've heard anecdotes that stopping HRT after being on it for several months basically burns out your endocrine system's ability to react to HRT in the future?

For anyone that's come on/off and then on again, how were the results the second time around? Did your body go back to pre-HRT masculinization after coming off, or did it become more masculine? Did restarting HRT have the same effect as the first time around?

I hope to restart my transition some time in the future but I'm not honestly 100% on it. At the same time if I knew that stopping now would make transitioning impossible, I might just keep going.

First off it's very interesting to read everyone’s stories and see the support/reactions from everyone here but I'm wondering... Is it really necessary to come out? Let me give some context to this question.

I have been seeing a psychologist for the last 5 months about various issues. (btw if you ever feel for a second that you think you should go... it's totally worth it.) One of the issues I went over was gender identity. First of all it's still an ongoing process and I am continuing onto a better place mentally. So first of all I'm not really sure where I land on the identity spectrum so I can't really comment on that, but I feel that whatever I am or aren't, I just don't feel a need to come out to anyone about it.

I'm just wondering what everyone else's thoughts were about this. I realize a part of this may be that I don't particularity care about pronouns or anything, and if I happened to be presenting female at the time I wouldn't be that upset if I was misgendered at the time. I can understand telling the people who's lives are directly affected by you (family and SO) but for the most part it just seems like it's making life harder than it should.

Again sorry if this made anyone uncomfortable but I was just more or less interested in what other people thought. (Also I'm currently going to bed so any replies I'll try to get to in the morning.)

I am kind of new to this and very much in the closet. Or publicly speaking, my closer friends know. Or, I don't hide that I'm bi but, it's complicated... I'm in my early 20's, 2-3 years ago I was depressed and my first happy memory was finding Andrej Pejic (as she was named at that point, I still love her and great for the trans-community she transitioned, but I loved her a little more before as a genderqueer). After that I had these phases of just ""fuck it, today I'm walking around in a skirt or even a dress"" for myself on the street, which was great but in retrospective I sort of looked like a maniac (no mean to offend anyone) and now I more want to actually develop a style and pull it off (more or less) instead of just going around in whatever (in public). During this period I never happened to bump into anyone I know (so I think).

I'm hoping of starting to move towards feminizing my style more and more, I already have in many ways, but often I get stuck in these paradoxes. First of all, some clothes that a girl can have in school as a sort of chill outfit, can on me start to feel like I'm over dressed, since girls clothes is a little bit more fancy at times. I hate that. And also to be able to walk out the door in a more dared style require of me that I'm in a great confident mood, otherwise I won't pull it off (getting warm, insecure, feel like crying on the toilet by peoples glances). Some outfits I liked for a while can suddenly make me feel disgusting as well (mostly it's the shoulders, hand and feet), which is absurd because I want to be androgynous and I find myself good looking and I know I am, I'm very lucky having that, it would be much harder without it. Then I seattle for something safe and more male and it looks good, but (sometimes) makes me really unhappy since it isn't me, and I just keep on feeding new people I meet with the wrong picture of me. Or wrong and wrong... Sometimes weeks go by and I'm happy expressing myself within the cis-boarders and then I get months of thinking it feels wrong every single day... I started growing my hair longer now, it touches my shoulders and I feel like crying out of happiness I'm finally letting it grow, but then I'm scared I wake up looking like an 80's metal musician or something terrible very unfeminine...

And then, I met this girl... She hasn't experienced much of my feminine sides, some clothing, but I'm a musician/artistic in general so I think the cliché artists dresses a little different haven't had her thinking about that I'm bi/(wishing to become more) genderqueer. But I could be wrong, I shave my legs/underarms/dick, she's seen the beauty-products in my bathroom (which doesn't need to prove anything, but straight girls I've been with before has noticed these things). Now I live abroad for a year and I only see her twice a month at best, I really like her and I made up my mind the other night (so I hope, but I doubt a lot) to be honest with her and dress and be the way I am, but I get caught up in these things... Being with a straight girl before usually makes me a little bit more straight, since the way I express my gender is fluid, so a lot of the time I really don't know how to dress when I see her and now I see her so rarely. I actually met her one week before I moved away, which is crazy and it's very unlike both of us to start a long distance relationship with that as a base, which speaks a lot how much we like each other (even though it's a naive newly in love won't probably hold in the long run-thing). Three months has gone now since I met her. She has depression and anxiety, which she told me about, and I've had that too so we've talked of those sort of things (but I kept quiet about the gender-things...). She's very fragile, and I'm afraid of putting her through some extra stress now, since I can be male a lot of the time too... She's different though, fits me great in that way, she's so good looking I find myself daydreaming I was her at times.

With my ex-girlfriend, who was very queer (bless her!) I tried pegging ([Fun Factory &lt;3](https://www.funfactory.com/en/dildos/share/)) for the first time and loved it (when we broke up she said ""Good luck being with a straight girl after this"" which sort of haunts me at times..). Hoping I could experience pegging with this girl too… Even though she wouldn't be into it it's just a category of sex for me, like a blow job etc. I can live without it if she's not into it, sex must be mutual, but I'm just scared mentioning it will make her think I really want to be with a man (some straight girls think this about bisexuality, I've been with men, that's not a problem, I'm with her now and want no one else).

My question is can anybody relate to this? What would you suggest to do from this point?

175,2014-11-22 23:17:38,2n4b4f,10,1,"I would like to start and say that I'm not transgender. I'm androgynous and my gender has never been a huge part of who I am, and I came to terms with myself many years ago in this respect. But I will say this much, if this is anything what you people go through, then I have my absolute condolences.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right place, there is no subreddit for the exact crisis that I'm going through and since it after talking with a few transwomen about my experiences and the relatedness of our issues we decided this is the best place to talk about it.

On Thursday I received a stark reminder of a skeleton that I have been trying to hide for years. I was reading an article about identity disorders, and I was reading transgender people putting their own input into it. One was explaining to a cisgendered person what the whole transwoman thing was all about. The person described it as being a mental unhappiness with her own body.

And suddenly that skeleton emerged. Not in the form of gender, but in the form of a disability.

While my earliest memories confound me (a skiing accident is likely the root of this), my earliest memories of a conflict of between my body and my image was when I was 8 years old or so (give or take a year). I remember for some reason, out of absolutely nowhere, that I was a blind actress. I imagined myself listening to people talk about me, and it felt like my destiny. That evening, as the sun set, I began to stare into it with my right eye. Due to the fact that it was late, and that staring into the sun is extremely difficult, no permanent damage outside of photosensitivity occurred in that eye. 

As I was going through my teenage years, I kept having little thoughts and ""fantasies"" (not sexual mind you) of going blind. Different stories, different actions all leading to the same thing.  I specifically remember spending a lot of time when I was in chemistry thinking about these things. There was a Carol Poster (http://www.flinnsci.com/store/catalogPhotos/AP6373.jpg) in the room, which was a running gag with the teacher. Most students saw the intended message - wear your safety goggles.

But I asked how it happened. I wanted to know what the story behind her descent into darkness was. And as wrong as it may sound, it was to fix what was wrong with myself.

Through these years, I felt that there was some way that I had to be. Some way that I had to follow metaphorical Carol into the darkness myself. A gravitational pull into a black hole, where no light would ever come out of again. 

Years passed. I got in a relationship with a blind man. Born with light perception, it was the most interesting experience I think I've had to this day. And for some reason I would constantly want to trade with him, just to *know*. My other blind friends thought this was fairly strange, but I think he seemed to understand. He told me that he thinks that I was reincarnated from a blind person who died in a horrific accident. I don't really believe in reincarnation, but I used the idea to try to ""vent"" these persistent feelings, which, as time went on grew stronger and stronger.

Within this conflict, I realized there were two players - emotion and logic. Logic is the only reason why I'm where I'm at now in life - thanks to logic I'm still able to have functionality in my eyes. But emotion is the skeletons in my closet. It, since that day as a child, that it wants a means to an end. People say to me - ""What if you regret your decision 10 years from now?"" and they don't understand that the feelings have only grown more intense in the last 13! It's very very scary though.

I realized on Thursday that submission of logic is inevitable. Logic requires reasons to continue to protect myself, and thus presents reasons why I can't stick a vial of lye in my eyes. The emotional side thus struck a deal - when there is a case when all of these ""open shoelaces"" are eventually ""tied"", it would be able to triumph against the logic. I have gotten extremely close to taking this away from me for ever on several occasions, due to this lack of of ""open shoelaces"" - it was honestly only because I discovered some at the last minute that I still have my vision. I now am considering writing a list of ""open shoelaces"" of accomplishments that I must make so that if I lose this battle, that I have completed what I wanted to do.

I'm mostly scared not because of who I am but how the world will perceive me. People are so foolish with blindness, they act like going blind is like dying. I know enough people going blind to know this isn't the truth, and that it's the perpetuation of these ideas that scare people more than the actual loss itself. I learned that my life could be manageable. But what holds me back is that if they ever found out the truth to my own mutilation, when I do it, they won't just see me as a poor blind woman, but they'll see me as a crazy horrible person. They'll want me locked up, and that's the worst thing they can do. To strip everything that I am because I tried to absolve myself from an evil feeling that will never go away, a feeling that grows with each sunset, with every image I see, until that fateful day comes.

Like I've said, it's not really a matter of if anymore, the shock on Thursday made me realize this. I have to open my arms and weep, knowing that my demons will one day consume me. And it's not that I fear it, but rather that I don't know what the future will hold. All I know is that my mind keeps begging for become it.

After telling my transwoman friend about it, she told me that if I use a blindfold that it would help relieve some of these tensions, for the same reason many transgender people wear the opposite sex's clothes. It did help, I was surprised. But I know that's not going to be good enough. It can pacify my inherent desires now. But it won't work forever. I'm thinking about getting completely black contacts and using them always while I'm in my apartment... but even that won't protect me.

I'm afraid of becoming a ""pretender"". I fully respect the men and women that who were born without a choice to the condition that my brain so idolizes. I have deep running morals, tied deeply with my internal obsession with canes, obscuring sunglasses, and the like. To me they're off limits until that day comes. Why? Because I am not someone who wants to ""pretend"", and I cannot submit to ""pretending"". People who pretend to be blind for jokes and things like that make me so furious, and it's instantly able to be seen, because the idiots have no idea how to use a damn cane. I vowed to myself I would never fall to that low. But I've taught myself how to use one. I even will be using it for a costume after I got a severe foot injury wearing it. And I feel that using it will simply indulge myself more, when my thoughts turn into nothing but this, and I have to face the darkness one last time.

I'm preparing myself for my future. I think people know that there is a dark side, I think they can sense it. I know the blindies know, but even others have seemed to give that vibe. They know that my obsessions with blindness, their techniques of observing the world, and my interest in empathizing with their experience runs deep.

I know that I need help, I'm going to speak to someone soon. I'm scared. I don't want to be considered crazy - I'm otherwise quite mentally stable despite my other challenges. I'm able to manage a full time job, school, personal life and even this without breaking down, and when I did there was a reason and I recovered. It's not like I'm crazy, but I know these urges are growing more intense, and know that logic is going to be cornered eventually and have to submit. I'm scared of that future, but I also want to embrace it. It's a oxymoron that persists through my mind - a feeling of denial of existence but fear of removing my own. Tension has come to a boil and I have no choice but to come out.

Before this, I used these feelings to empathize with the community and take and help them with their own challenges and the inequalities they faced. And even though I will continue to dedicate myself to that cause, I cannot just pour it all into that bucket anymore.

I don't want to attach any sort of ""trans"" label onto myself, ultimately because I am conflicted on any sort of transition, despite knowing that it will come eventually. My brain's freedom from these thoughts is becoming so much smaller and smaller.

Again, I'm sorry if this isn't the right place. There is literally nowhere else I can put this, outside of the small blind forums of those whom I trust, to which I've already written. I gathered all of my strength to post here, I'm sorry if it's not right. If this goes against the rules, then so be it. But I believe that if this is what dysphoria is then I have all of my sympathies.

But I will say this much, if this is anything what you people go through, then I have my absolute condolences.\n\nI\'m sorry if this isn\'t the right place, there is no subreddit for the exact crisis that I\'m going through and since it after talking with a few transwomen about my experiences and the relatedness of our issues we decided this is the best place to talk about it.\n\nOn Thursday I received a stark reminder of a skeleton that I have been trying to hide for years. I was reading an article about identity disorders, and I was reading transgender people putting their own input into it. One was explaining to a cisgendered person what the whole transwoman thing was all about. The person described it as being a mental unhappiness with her own body.\n\nAnd suddenly that skeleton emerged. Not in the form of gender, but in the form of a disability.\n\nWhile my earliest memories confound me (a skiing accident is likely the root of this), my earliest memories of a conflict of between my body and my image was when I was 8 years old or so (give or take a year). I remember for some reason, out of absolutely nowhere, that I was a blind actress. I imagined myself listening to people talk about me, and it felt like my destiny. That evening, as the sun set, I began to stare into it with my right eye. Due to the fact that it was late, and that staring into the sun is extremely difficult, no permanent damage outside of photosensitivity occurred in that eye. \n\nAs I was going through my teenage years, I kept having little thoughts and ""fantasies"" (not sexual mind you) of going blind. Different stories, different actions all leading to the same thing.  I specifically remember spending a lot of time when I was in chemistry thinking about these things. There was a Carol Poster (http://www.flinnsci.com/store/catalogPhotos/AP6373.jpg) in the room, which was a running gag with the teacher. Most students saw the intended message - wear your safety goggles.\n\nBut I asked how it happened. I wanted to know what the story behind her descent into darkness was. And as wrong as it may sound, it was to fix what was wrong with myself.\n\nThrough these years, I felt that there was some way that I had to be. Some way that I had to follow metaphorical Carol into the darkness myself. A gravitational pull into a black hole, where no light would ever come out of again. \n\nYears passed. I got in a relationship with a blind man. Born with light perception, it was the most interesting experience I think I\'ve had to this day. And for some reason I would constantly want to trade with him, just to *know*. My other blind friends thought this was fairly strange, but I think he seemed to understand. He told me that he thinks that I was reincarnated from a blind person who died in a horrific accident. I don\'t really believe in reincarnation, but I used the idea to try to ""vent"" these persistent feelings, which, as time went on grew stronger and stronger.\n\nWithin this conflict, I realized there were two players - emotion and logic. Logic is the only reason why I\'m where I\'m at now in life - thanks to logic I\'m still able to have functionality in my eyes. But emotion is the skeletons in my closet. It, since that day as a child, that it wants a means to an end. People say to me - ""What if you regret your decision 10 years from now?"" and they don\'t understand that the feelings have only grown more intense in the last 13! It\'s very very scary though.\n\nI realized on Thursday that submission of logic is inevitable. Logic requires reasons to continue to protect myself, and thus presents reasons why I can\'t stick a vial of lye in my eyes. The emotional side thus struck a deal - when there is a case when all of these ""open shoelaces"" are eventually ""tied"", it would be able to triumph against the logic. I have gotten extremely close to taking this away from me for ever on several occasions, due to this lack of of ""open shoelaces"" - it was honestly only because I discovered some at the last minute that I still have my vision. I now am considering writing a list of ""open shoelaces"" of accomplishments that I must make so that if I lose this battle, that I have completed what I wanted to do.\n\nI\'m mostly scared not because of who I am but how the world will perceive me. People are so foolish with blindness, they act like going blind is like dying. I know enough people going blind to know this isn\'t the truth, and that it\'s the perpetuation of these ideas that scare people more than the actual loss itself. I learned that my life could be manageable. But what holds me back is that if they ever found out the truth to my own mutilation, when I do it, they won\'t just see me as a poor blind woman, but they\'ll see me as a crazy horrible person. They\'ll want me locked up, and that\'s the worst thing they can do. To strip everything that I am because I tried to absolve myself from an evil feeling that will never go away, a feeling that grows with each sunset, with every image I see, until that fateful day comes.\n\nLike I\'ve said, it\'s not really a matter of if anymore, the shock on Thursday made me realize this. I have to open my arms and weep, knowing that my demons will one day consume me. And it\'s not that I fear it, but rather that I don\'t know what the future will hold. All I know is that my mind keeps begging for become it.\n\nAfter telling my transwoman friend about it, she told me that if I use a blindfold that it would help relieve some of these tensions, for the same reason many transgender people wear the opposite sex\'s clothes. It did help, I was surprised. But I know that\'s not going to be good enough. It can pacify my inherent desires now. But it won\'t work forever. I\'m thinking about getting completely black contacts and using them always while I\'m in my apartment... but even that won\'t protect me.\n\nI\'m afraid of becoming a ""pretender"". I fully respect the men and women that who were born without a choice to the condition that my brain so idolizes. I have deep running morals, tied deeply with my internal obsession with canes, obscuring sunglasses, and the like. To me they\'re off limits until that day comes. Why? Because I am not someone who wants to ""pretend"", and I cannot submit to ""pretending"". People who pretend to be blind for jokes and things like that make me so furious, and it\'s instantly able to be seen, because the idiots have no idea how to use a damn cane. I vowed to myself I would never fall to that low. But I\'ve taught myself how to use one. I even will be using it for a costume after I got a severe foot injury wearing it. And I feel that using it will simply indulge myself more, when my thoughts turn into nothing but this, and I have to face the darkness one last time.\n\nI\'m preparing myself for my future. I think people know that there is a dark side, I think they can sense it. I know the blindies know, but even others have seemed to give that vibe. They know that my obsessions with blindness, their techniques of observing the world, and my interest in empathizing with their experience runs deep.\n\nI know that I need help, I\'m going to speak to someone soon. I\'m scared. I don\'t want to be considered crazy - I\'m otherwise quite mentally stable despite my other challenges. I\'m able to manage a full time job, school, personal life and even this without breaking down, and when I did there was a reason and I recovered. It\'s not like I\'m crazy, but I know these urges are growing more intense, and know that logic is going to be cornered eventually and have to submit. I\'m scared of that future, but I also want to embrace it. It\'s a oxymoron that persists through my mind - a feeling of denial of existence but fear of removing my own. Tension has come to a boil and I have no choice but to come out.\n\nBefore this, I used these feelings to empathize with the community and take and help them with their own challenges and the inequalities they faced. And even though I will continue to dedicate myself to that cause, I cannot just pour it all into that bucket anymore.\n\nI don\'t want to attach any sort of ""trans"" label onto myself, ultimately because I am conflicted on any sort of transition, despite knowing that it will come eventually. My brain\'s freedom from these thoughts is becoming so much smaller and smaller.\n\nAgain, I\'m sorry if this isn\'t the right place. There is literally nowhere else I can put this, outside of the small blind forums of those whom I trust, to which I\'ve already written. I gathered all of my strength to post here, I\'m sorry if it\'s not right. If this goes against the rules, then so be it. But I believe that if this is what dysphoria is then I have all of my sympathies.\n\nThank you for reading.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Cornered', 'created': 1416723458.0}",34.0

Hi all, I came here since researching hasn't come up with much. Mainly since I have no idea what to even search for. This may be long. I will try and make it easy to read and there will be a TD;LR.

I identify as a lesbian, I am married to a woman as well. I am biologically a female. Although, I dress very masculine. I feel naked if I am not wearing boxers or mens clothes. I cannot even bring myself to wear anything that shows my chest.

The weird part is that sometimes I don't mind it. Once every few months I will want to wear slightly feminine clothes, like tank tops and cardigans. The urge leaves almost as soon as it comes. Then the idea of wearing those clothes isn't even a thought.

People often mistake me for a man. I am young and am often accused of having a fake ID or they comment on my female name. I just play the part and act as if I was male. I say it's because I am saving them the embarrassment of thinking I was a male. I am starting to wonder if it's true, wondering if thats the reason i do it. It feels pretty damn good when i am thought of as a guy. It sometimes feels like a victory, sometimes it doesn't (generally based on how they act)

In bed I always want to use a strap-on. I feel defeated if my wife isn't feeling it that day (she is bisexual so it isnt often). I like when she touches it even if i can't feel it. I also feel uncomfortable in ""feminine"" positions in bed.

On top of this I am fine calling myself a woman. I don't feel like I have dysphoria, although i am not completely sure what it entails. I also couldn't imagine getting surgery on my downstairs region

##Warping the gender

####[Introduction]

It feels quite safe to say in 2014 that the man/woman strict gender duality is
an old-fashioned idea. Society (at least from some broad point of view) got
accustomed to any kind of shades, variations, transgenderisms. But the word
transgender still means going from one side to the other among two. Transition-
ing FTM or MTF implies that you are on one bank of the river and want to pass
to the other bank. 

And thus, even if we found a ford and intermediate steps
on emerging stone are allowed, the duality is still present. In the questionable
picture in which men and women are the two extrema of a segment, the idea of a
standard, normal man/woman has relatively little changed in hum#an history. In
modern history feminism helped a lot to put the woman side of the segment at
an equal level to the man one in terms of principles, rights, worth. But even the
most modern idea of a woman lacks of certain features that the human species
is starting to sport. It is time to make the leap and start to accept a further
more evolved idea of gender. 

What follows is the trans-woman manifesto, where
trans does not mean going from female to male but instead means going beyond
the traditional gender features of the species. In this sense a better word to
describe it would perhaps be trans-human. A very similar manifesto could be
written from a man’s point of view, going beyond the borders of male gender.
Let us leave it to others. Here we focus on a fictional character named Adamah:
in the modern society’s eye and words she’s a straight woman with some strange
ideas. In reality she’s trans-human as we shall describe.

####[The manifesto]

Adamah is a female. Undeniably. She has female sexual characters and feels
generally comfortable with them. She sure would not prefer to be a man. Never
thought for a second that it would be better to grow a penis. But there are
certain features of the standard femaleness that she dislikes. She wants her
body to be slim, muscled, sharp. She wants to be strong, agile and quick. The
soft and round stereotype of the motherly woman does not fit her, nor the soft
and round one of sexy babe, nor the one of weak skinny models. Not that any
kind of body-type has something bad or wrong in principle. She just made the
choice to have body with certain features instead of others.

Adamah does not want to have children. Nope. No thanks. She does not
want to be a mother, to generate and share her body for a while with another
creature. And then be a parent. She is not at all interested in this part of the
“femaleness”. As a consequence, she technically does not need the part of body
plumbery related solely to reproduction. Basically the female stuff which is not
involved in sexual pleasure is useless from her point of view. Quick example:
boobs→useful, ovaries→useless. So, when her very sporty lifestyle and food
habits led to the slow desappearance of her menses she quickly shrugged off an
initial tip of concern and she welcomed the new setup with a sense of joy and
relief. Being female without the bother of a monthly useless recurrence seems
to her like a great deal.

She likes the idea of being able to control her body with habits, especially
the nutritional ones. The body is like a piece of hardware in some sense and like
programmers we can just run with the default settings or modify them through
new software, hacks, scripts, code snippets. She knows that this could be like
playing with fire, that it can be dangerous and unhealthy. But a lot of things
are. And it is not so hard to stay on the right track and not fall into the abyss:
it is all a matter of finding your own balance and staying rational. Basically, all
you need is love for yourself. Which we as human usually have plenty of.
So she claims the freedom to manipulate her body and be a different kind
of a woman than the standard one. She enjoys her heterosexual sex habits. She
welcomes physical transformations by discipline and training, instead than pills-
induced. She does not want to be less feminine to become more masculine. Not
interested in going on T and grow a beard. But for sure she is less female than
the percentage required to the standard femaleness to which we are accustomed.
At the end of the day, of course, she does not give a shit about labels, she is
primarily and most of all herself.",genderqueer,what do you think of this gender warping story?,1417145092.0,"{'created_utc': 1417119892, 'id': '2nluj5', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': '###A post-woman manifesto\n##Warping the gender\n\n####[Introduction]\n\nIt feels quite safe to say in 2014 that the man/woman strict gender duality is\nan old-fashioned idea.
