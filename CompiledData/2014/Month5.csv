7,2014-05-07 17:21:19,24ysz9,6,9,"Hello everyone... 

This is my first ever post, I'm 29 Genderqueer MTF. I've been a bit timid to do much yet. I am starting to slowly explore clothing and make up. I've spoken with my parents, told a very small selection of friends.... including my handsome roommate (who is over my shoulder telling me to add that right now). It's been a very depressing couple of weeks. 

After the huge buzz of figuring a part of myself was missing. I did get to feel pretty, female friends I told accepted me. Although I lost one close friend. Not for saying that I was trans, but because our relationship became too complicated sexually, but her support is very very missed. 

No one else knows, my facebook world doesn't. I posted this comic http://www.dumpaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/women-stripping-funny.jpg for a little context, I had been a burlesque performer and male stripper myself in the past. 

I instantly got jumped up and down upon by a person I have not met in real life. I was verbally attacked for being sexist, misogynistic and perpetuating issues of the male gaze, the down trodden nature the patriarchal society creates. I tried to explain that this comic is funny out of its reductive truth, there has been an evolution/de-evolution in society. I tried to justify expressing this side of my sense of humour without outing myself. 

But I felt destroyed as a male and questioned my acceptance as a possible female. I have since had nightmares being attacked by women. I discussed later with this same feminist about the their attitude to other women including black women, and LGBT. Lesbians seem to be accepted, everything else she stated as ""watering down the issue"", and ""they have their own groups for that"".

I've never been violent, aggressive or dominant. And have actually hated men myself for those very reasons. I had to move from a small rural area because I could not find a place or acceptance. Now I live in Melbourne, a capital city. I got into performance, and for the longest time got to express myself enough that I felt comfortable with myself. But I was secretly unhappy, conflicted and felt worthless I drank to numb anxiety. I got to perform in drag in a couple of burlesque shows and LOVED IT. Now I don't want to live artificial or heightened anymore. I want be me, fulltime, normal, real. But now that I've run up against females I thought were friends. Females posting very anti-male statements that I tried to call for some temperance on... only to be deleted. University friends stating some very firm men cause the problem statements, including one female friend I quite liked and am now scared of. I don't fear men when I come out, I've dealt my whole childhood not being accepted by men, so fuck that. I felt safe with women, I trusted women, I looked up to women for achieving and giving, but now?

Now I feel really uncomfortable with women and men. I hate me for being male and not being right in my body, and I'm scared of women for not accepting me as trans or as a woman, or hating both parts of me. The male me... the female me that doesn't think like them.

Yes these are huge psychological issues, I'm seeing a psychiatrist, I'm in an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Group. But I have no Trans or Genderqueer people to ask. 

I have decided to deactivate Facebook for now, it makes me angry that people are so maligned against each other. For gods sake we just want to be accepted by one another.

What do I do? Is it going to get easier? I've had a lesbian friend who when I came out to her told me I should do drag instead of transitioning. But I don't want to be accepted as a curio? A parody of a woman, a caricature? 

I'm feeling very alone. I've got a world of other questions, about hormones, therapy, clothes, make up, androgyne status. But right now I just want to know things can be ok. And that the little boy that felt he should be a girl isn't going to be put through the ringer...

I don't care what you identify as;  I would never use violence or coercion against anyone no matter what their identity is.  I just want to get this out of the way so that I don't get a barrage of ""UR TRANSPHOBIC"" stuff.  Let's have a real discussion with respect to all sides.  I don't have any problem with trans people.  For me this is an intellectual issue and not a moral one.

If someone identifies as ""transgender""... which means that their biological gender conflicts with their self-image and internal feeling of what their gender is... then can this apply to other things too?

Can I be trans-black or trans-asian or trans-african?  Can I be trans-fat or trans-skinny?  How about trans-diabetic? How about trans-rich?  If I internally identify as something other than my biology or state of being, where do you draw the line between legitimate and illegitimate?  

It seems to me that this concept could include literally anything.  I could even identify as a trans-insect or a trans-fox or a trans-stopsign for that matter.

10,2014-05-05 02:39:06,24qs8b,9,8,"Hello, peeps. I'm in my late twenties, married to a man, androphile, and assigned female at birth.

I never identified strongly as a woman. When I was a kid I had short hair and was read as a boy as often as a girl. Then I went through puberty, got a large chest, and that kind of ""mistake"" never happened again. And I've been missing it.

I don't identify as trans, because I'm kind of fine with my body most of the time. I also don't feel like going through transition would bring me much, and since men are more often attracted to women, it also always seemed easier to find partners.

I also don't identify as cisgender. I don't feel a sense of belonging with femininity most of the time. I've always felt that if I had been born in a sexually male body, I'd still be the exact same person otherwise. While I know this is the kind of thing that can't really be verified, it just feels that way to me.

So I kept in my little ""female"" labelled-box, but I just don't feel like I belong. I've been described as feminine, masculine, a gay guy in a woman's body, a tomboy. I just wish I could just be a person without any concern for gender.

Sometimes I would like to be seen as male and dress accordingly, but my body is so feminine it's pretty much impossible.

My other problem is that I'm married. I didn't really think hard about these things before. I figured not ""feeling"" male or female was normal, that your body was what you went by. Then I met trans people and I was confused, and I realise most people identify with a gender. Once when my husband was talking about how something I did was normal because ""women are like that"", I mentioned that I thought the comment was stupid, and I don't even feel like a woman anyway.

He freaked out completely, said I should have told him before we got married, that he didn't even know who I was anymore. That comes from a guy who is one of the people to have described me as ""a gay guy in a woman's body"" so I got very confused. As a result I'm very reluctant about talking to him more about gender identity. I feel like it's not that huge a deal in the end, that being in a woman's body allows me to easily wear male-oriented clothing (pants, suits, etc), so I'm much luckier than if I had been born with a male body, since wearing a skirt or dress would have been much more obvious.

I decided to create an account so I could hang out with you guys (I mean that in the most gender-neutral way possible, by the way). Maybe talk a bit, figure out if I fit in here or if I'm just making mountains out of molehills. Maybe just get some support and decide where to go from here.

I feel like it\'s not that huge a deal in the end, that being in a woman\'s body allows me to easily wear male-oriented clothing (pants, suits, etc), so I\'m much luckier than if I had been born with a male body, since wearing a skirt or dress would have been much more obvious.\n\nI decided to create an account so I could hang out with you guys (I mean that in the most gender-neutral way possible, by the way). Maybe talk a bit, figure out if I fit in here or if I\'m just making mountains out of molehills. Maybe just get some support and decide where to go from here.\n\nAdvice would be really appreciated. I can answer questions if I was unclear. Thanks, everyone!', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""Not sure where I stand... freaked out.

First off, my mother is extremely unwelcoming to this kind of thing. She is homophobic, transphobic, racist, you name it. I plan on expressing my gender identity more openly once I leave for college, but for now I keep up a mostly feminine persona (as I am biologically female.) 
Of course, there are a few things I am concerned about regarding my choice to alter my appearance in the next few years when I leave home. I think the biggest change for me would have to be changing my hairstyle. I love my hair- Its long, thick,and wavy; brown with natural blonde streaks, etc. Basically I'm really uncomfortable with the idea of chopping it off. 
Of course, without doing so I won't have the desired, more androgynous look for switching easily between more masculine and feminine appearances.

One brochure is aimed towards college students who identify as genderqueer, and the other brochure is aimed towards the parents of these students, and is intended to be something that someone can give to their parents when they come out.  Both of them cover topics like gender v. sex, dysphoria, and the gender binary, and then they have special sections specifically for their intended audience.  The brochures are part of an activism project for my gender studies course.

I've got a lot of informational stuff, but what I really want is to put a personal touch on these.  I'd like some quotes that I can add to it.  I'm an androgyne (just came out to my parents this year too), and so I've got some of my experiences to share, but I'd really like to get stuff from a variety of people.  

For the parents' brochure, I especially need quotes for these sections:

What does it mean to be nonbinary?

Why is gender important?

What is dysphoria?

How do I support my child?

I will take any quotes at all, though.  The more, the better.  I don't want to invade anyone's privacy, so I won't ask for names with quotes.  Give me an alias if you want, otherwise I'll probably just toss a gender-neutral name next to it.  It'd be cool if I could add how you define your identity though, because I'd like to show the diversity of genderqueer identities.  

I'm planning on giving the parents' brochure to my parents when I'm finished, so this is really really important to me.  Please take a minute to just jot something down.  

TL;DR: Making brochures about genderqueer identities for college students and parents, please give me some quotes that I can put on there about what it's like to be genderqueer?

EDIT: Thanks for what you've given me so far!  I've added it to the brochure.  I could still use a lot more, so don't hesitate to offer more quotes.  I want to have a variety of voices.  I also still need quotes for the students' brochure- encouraging stuff, tips about presentation or anything that you wish someone had told you.

Essentially, what I'm writing about is about the *process* that you as an individual went through to figure out what your identity is (or how it is evolving). I'm specifically interested in the initial separation from the traditional gender identity/performance and what that process looked or felt like. This is a really huge topic that is only looked at on a large scale perspective but I'm more interested in individual accounts rather than the normal post-modernist queer theory approach (I think it is waaaay too generalizing trying to pinpoint a single modality (or method) of forming into a queer identifier).  

I don't know if I'm explaining what I want well enough, if there are any questions PLEASE comment or PM me.

I'm different, and proud to be.  I'm out to my husband and friends about my sexuality and gender identity.  I've always stood strong in the face of any situation that's tried to belittle me or put me down for looking different or being different, and am proud I've been able to.  
Thing is, there's one area of my life I just can't seem to translate that strength across to, and it's making me feel like it's not really there after all, like I'd just been kidding myself that I was strong and proud of who I am.  
I genuinely don't care what other people think of me - the reason this thing bothers me isn't because of what they may be thinking, but because in the moment, I know they're making a snap judgement of me because of it, and that makes me feel angry but also really defenceless because I don't know how to counter it.  
As soon as I tell someone I'm a housewife and don't have kids, they look at me like they expect me to be some high heels wearing, perfectly manicured and coiffed 50s stereotype.  Like I'm a footballers wife who just got married so she could let a guy look after her, or a golddigger.  It's such a stupid thing, but I'm so down on myself for failing on this front, and I can't help but beat myself up for letting my partner down for not being stronger in these situations either.  I feel like if I'm not proud to be a housewife, proud to be that knowing that he works so that I *can*, that I'm discrediting him and what he works for, and that I'm becoming less and less of the kind of person who deserves someone to do that for them in the first place.

My face can still pass as fairly androgynous and I keep my hair short, but even binders don't do as good a job as I'd like keeping the rest of me even remotely non-female.

But that's not really the issue. I know how to dress to bring out my androgynous features and how to downplay my figure. The thing is, I started dating a guy two years ago, and it stuck. We live together now. He's fantastic, he helps me be who I want to be in almost every way, and he is by no means unsupportive... but he is also by no means attracted to androgyny or male features.

It's not his fault that he's attracted to women, that I happen to have a stupidly feminine figure, that when he met me I was feeling particularly girly.

I present as a male, not overtly masculine, but there is nothing about my appearance that is queer.

Also, I prefer the company of women.  I was never one of the guys, even though I wasn't girly either, I just feel more comfortable hanging out with girls than I do with guys.

77,2014-05-24 03:24:07,26co30,16,17,"Thanks for taking the time to read my post. I hope that posts like these are acceptable in this subreddit -- I haven't found any other subreddits that appear devoted to genderqueer discussions.

I am in a two-year long relationship with a [born-as] woman. We met on a dating site and I quickly fell in love: She is mega-intelligent, she is ultra-talented, she's hilarious, and she cuts a feminine figure that puts Venus to shame. 

As our relationship progressed, it became increasingly clear that she identified as a gay man in a woman's body. What started off as seemingly playful comments -- ""Man, I wish I had a penis! They're so fascinating!"" or ""I feel like a gay guy in a woman's body!"" -- evolved into a formal declaration of her gender/sexual identity. She admitted it earlier this year... and I had my suspicions for at least the past year, but I was unphased: I love her, she loves me, and I'd still love her if she came-out as an alien from the Andromeda galaxy. 

I wanted to completely understand her perspective and experiences, so we had a thorough talk about everything. She admitted to feeling bashful or displeased by her primary and secondary sex traits (which I had picked-up on for quite a while), she's into ladyboy/gay porn, she has a borderline obsessive fascination with penises, and her mind generally works similarly to a stereotypical male's mind (e.g. analytical, stoic, capable). She considered transitioning into a male body and embracing masculine traits/roles -- mistakenly believing that life is generally easier for guys than it is for gals -- but she came to realize that any socially-assigned gender comes with its commensurate baggage. In the end, she explained that she's moving forward in her biologically-assigned body, but embracing aspects of masculinity and femininity that she finds most appealing. Plus, this allows her to retain the nerve endings in her genitals... despite feeling like she missed out when God was handing-out penises. 

Initially, I was happy to know that she trusts me enough to be honest about such an important piece of her identity, and I was [selfishly] relieved that she wants to stay outwardly female. However, as much as I like to think I'm a progressive, flexible guy, I'm a pretty straightforward straight guy. I'm feeling some intense guilt and shame recently because it's become clear to me that a large part of my attraction to my partner is based on her biologically-assigned sex. It's also become clear that I'm not her preferred physical type, and I've realized that it's possible she would remain in our relationship despite the possibility that I'm not right for her. 

It's become increasingly difficult to have sex because I feel that it's at the expense of her dysphoria -- her body is amazing, but I know that the aspects I enjoy most are those that make her feel most self-conscious. When I bring this up with her, she explains that I'm free to enjoy her body... but I dunno, when she says that, it makes me think that the enjoyment is completely one-sided. It's difficult for me to get into sex if it feels like I'm the only one enjoying the experience... for better or worse, I feel terrible when I think that she bears with it because she wants me to be happy. Even when I manage to get my mind off of that aspect, I can't help but remember her preferred physical type. Like I mentioned earlier, she's a fan of guys with feminine physical characteristics: Less hair, thin and delicate builds, and gay. I'm the antithesis of this picture: I'm hairier than a testosterone factory, I'm built like a retired linebacker, and I'm straight.  

Apart from those gender/sexual-identity-related issues, there are some personality and behavioral observations that are beginning to concern me. 

First, she has said things in the past that make me worry that she settles for anyone who wants to date her... and this is reflected by a past history of remaining in long-term relationships with men who she can barely stand, who are abusive, or who are just downright disrespectful. She was engaged to a zealously religious man who intimidated her into sex; she dated a med student who was obsessed with sports, had anal sex with her when she slept, and who left her without saying a single word near their one-year anniversary; she dated a guy for months whose ADHD was so severe that she could barely stand his presence. In contrast, she is an atheist, she couldn't be less interested in sports or non-consensual sex, and her own diagnoses with OCD and Asperger's would make it very difficult to cope with someone with severe ADHD. In general, this worries me, because I can't be sure she genuinely loves me, or if she reciprocates because she feels I'm her only option. This also worries me because I don't want to cage her: if she's not into me, so be it, and I want her to be happy regardless who she's with. 

Second, she's often out-of-touch with the intuitive aspects of her mind -- i.e. emotions or self-awarenes. I think she's grown out-of-touch because, being an Aspie, she's grown accustomed to having her emotions invalidated and to being socially ostracized for simply being herself. When we have arguments, they are generally resolve in a positive manner: Our dual masculine natures push us towards objective, problem-solving-oriented solutions. However, she avoids confrontations like the plague, and it usually falls to me to detect something amiss in her mood or behavior. Sometimes, I feel like if I never even brought up our issues, she'd silently suffer through them for an indefinite time. This couples to my last point: Is she with me because she's genuinely attracted to me? Does she stay because she loves me, or because she doesn't want to rock the boat? Eventually, an issue will arise that I'll be completely unaware of, and that I'll be unable to detect -- What happens then?

Anyways, I guess I'm just looking for perspectives from others who identify similarly as my partner, or from those whose partners are GQ, or for links to resources that are not super-public-media-relationey.  I love my gf, and we are talking about these issues and communicating about them as best we can. However, it would really help me to put things into perspective if I could hear from those who have been on either side of this situation.

tl,dr; Girlfriend comes-out to me as genderqueer (born female, feels like a gay man), decides she wants move forward as her biologically-assigned sex, and I'm cool with that. However, I worry about antagonizing her dysphoria, I worry that I'm not her preferred physical type, and I worry that she's settling with me.

The local council has cut a large majority of the funding for its youth support. Although our LGBT youth worker's job is safe for the next 18 months, the building in which we meet will be shut and if another venue cannot be found, the group will go with it.

This is ridiculous. It's a decision made by middle class heterosexual men who have no experience or understanding of the difficulties growing up LGBTQ. A survey done by Metro found that 44% of LGBT young people have contemplated suicide and 52% have self harmed. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/25711600) As all of you know, we need the support and help that the youth service barely managed to provide now.

As young people, we attempting to fight this decision so I'm asking you to stand with us and other LGBTQ youth to show the Conservative Government how vital these services are.

In my own experience, I have no where else to go where I know people will call me by my chosen name. At least weekly I hear my mother refer to any form as queerness as 'sick' or 'perverse'. Youth groups allow people to find others that they relate to, that they understand. Through this service I have met other trans* people and I made friends who I know support me and respect my identity.

86,2014-05-26 20:14:58,26jp7t,8,7,"Hey

Since coming out as trans* I've had a long chat with my brother and then conferred with my parents and, we're still going to see a therapist, but I think I'm most probably gender fluid as I have had peak and troughs of dysphoria for ages suggesting I'm 'fluid' and the doubts I've been having this past week, and talk with my family, have confirmed that. However just a few questions:

Mainly, how can I express my gender if I'm feeling girly?  Obviously, begin maab it's harder for me to do that as people are more likely to stare and judge. Like if a faab wears men's clothes she can get away with that however it's a totally different story with a guy dressing in girls clothes so how can I express my gender on girly days without drawing too much attention to myself?

I could wear more flowery guy clothes and androgynous clothes but what kinda things are androgynous?  And what kind of girly clothes cold I get away with?  

Also my hair, I really want to grow it to a more gender neutral length but when my useless boys hair grows it grows out wards and all bushy, what can I do to get it to grow down?  Obviously a barber will be useless in circumstance so do I just take a picture of a desire hairstyle to a hairdressers/salon/stylist and said ""do this""?  

Finally on a different note, what of my sexuality?  I feel I'm mainly attracted to girls however I'm sure I'm asexual - the whole 'penis-in-vagina' thing just seems sickening and eww - so I'm worried I might never be able to get a girlfriend with my asexuality and gender fluidity - I mean who's going to want a boyfriend like that?!

Finally (again) my brith name in Daniel, obviously Danny is the gender neutral medium, bout how would I spell that to reflect the bigender-ness: Dani, Dany, Danny, Danie?

Pretty recently in my life, about a bit over half a year ago, I met a genderqueer female in the Norwegian equivalent of High School. We quickly became good friends and I was introduced to her group of friends, whom I to this day frequently hang out with. Now, throughout a large portion of my life I had been toying with the thought of me, but with female aspects. I've also usually figured myself straight (because I knew I liked girls), but acknowledged to myself that there is a possibility of me being bisexual, even more so when I began experimenting with anal masturbation around a year and a half ago. Well, after I met this genderqueer girl (who are now one of my best friends) a lot of those thoughts blossomed again.

So I opened up much more and I began embracing those thoughts I occasionally had, about being feminine and about who I was. I ended up discovering an innate desire to be feminine. Of course, that made me pretty confused and insecure in regards to my identity and sexuality, and at this point I'm describing what I ""feel like"" as bigender and pansexual. At the end of December, whilst these ideas were still growing, I got into a relationship with a cis girl. Due to my insecurity I didn't tell her, partly because I was anxious and partly because I wasn't sure myself. After a couple of months (two-three months ago) I did tell her (but because of circumstances that were really unideal), and she ended up leaving me because she wasn't sure she could support my identity. I've mostly gotten past her now.

Present day, I'm starting to embrace my femininity. I'm not entirely content with my body shape and wish that I had more hips and a larger bottom. I'd also like to obtain breasts, though I'm not sure how I'd go about that. I'm strongly considering estrogen, but I'm not sure if I should wait 'till I get older, nor am I completely sure what it would accomplish. Cross-dressing is something I'd like to try out, and I would like to pursue more feminine/androgynous clothing (something I'm currently lacking). However, despite feeling as well as wanting to be feminine, *I don't want to abandon my masculinity either*. That is why I assume bigender to be the term that describes my identity the best. That said, the way I've understood it bigender implies that one ""switches"" gender, whilst I feel like I identify as both, leaning slightly towards feminine. 

In addition to that conundrum, there's also the matter of family. My parents divorced when I was one year old, and I lived with my mother since. She married again last year, and I have a good relationship with my step-dad. I don't think either of them are actually homo-phobic or the like, however, with me being pretty anxious and having a lack of self-confidence, I've only recently approached my mother about it, twice. And it went... not as great as it could have. The first time she reacted pretty badly, passive-aggressively questioning whether I wanted to dress in girls clothing, whether I was gay, etc. and she also stated that she didn't believe me because ""I was very boy-ish when I was a kid"". It felt pretty condescending. She occasionally mocked me afterwards, though I think it wasn't intentional and she did apologize when she realized what she was doing, but it still hurt. I did approach her a second time and tried to go as in-depth about my identity (and a little about my sexuality as well), and it went better, but while I think she now acknowledges it, I still don't think she really understands, nor do I feel like I have her support. This hasn't exactly made me more confident about opening up, and I don't feel like talking about it with my family more unless I have to.

Anyway, that's my story and situation. Any advice or support is greatly appreciated, and putting my mind out on text help in itself, so thank you, Reddit :)

So I'm maab, gender fluid, 17 and am just starting to get chest hair. This is awful :'( because when I'm feeling like a girl the hair is just dysphoria inducing and even when I'm feeling more boyish or neutral, it's still grim - looking at my brother it's just eww!

* how much is it to get your chest waxed?

* when should I? I'm guessing not until it's longer and I'm 18 but that still leaves the awkward conversation ""mum, could I get my chest waxed?"" and the possible piss taking which accompanies that from friends and family.

12,2014-05-05 02:39:06,24qs8b,9,8,"Hello, peeps. I'm in my late twenties, married to a man, androphile, and assigned female at birth.

I never identified strongly as a woman. When I was a kid I had short hair and was read as a boy as often as a girl. Then I went through puberty, got a large chest, and that kind of ""mistake"" never happened again. And I've been missing it.

I don't identify as trans, because I'm kind of fine with my body most of the time. I also don't feel like going through transition would bring me much, and since men are more often attracted to women, it also always seemed easier to find partners.

I also don't identify as cisgender. I don't feel a sense of belonging with femininity most of the time. I've always felt that if I had been born in a sexually male body, I'd still be the exact same person otherwise. While I know this is the kind of thing that can't really be verified, it just feels that way to me.

So I kept in my little ""female"" labelled-box, but I just don't feel like I belong. I've been described as feminine, masculine, a gay guy in a woman's body, a tomboy. I just wish I could just be a person without any concern for gender.

Sometimes I would like to be seen as male and dress accordingly, but my body is so feminine it's pretty much impossible.

My other problem is that I'm married. I didn't really think hard about these things before. I figured not ""feeling"" male or female was normal, that your body was what you went by. Then I met trans people and I was confused, and I realise most people identify with a gender. Once when my husband was talking about how something I did was normal because ""women are like that"", I mentioned that I thought the comment was stupid, and I don't even feel like a woman anyway.

He freaked out completely, said I should have told him before we got married, that he didn't even know who I was anymore. That comes from a guy who is one of the people to have described me as ""a gay guy in a woman's body"" so I got very confused. As a result I'm very reluctant about talking to him more about gender identity. I feel like it's not that huge a deal in the end, that being in a woman's body allows me to easily wear male-oriented clothing (pants, suits, etc), so I'm much luckier than if I had been born with a male body, since wearing a skirt or dress would have been much more obvious.

I decided to create an account so I could hang out with you guys (I mean that in the most gender-neutral way possible, by the way). Maybe talk a bit, figure out if I fit in here or if I'm just making mountains out of molehills. Maybe just get some support and decide where to go from here.

24,2014-05-07 17:21:19,24ysz9,6,9,"Hello everyone... 

This is my first ever post, I'm 29 Genderqueer MTF. I've been a bit timid to do much yet. I am starting to slowly explore clothing and make up. I've spoken with my parents, told a very small selection of friends.... including my handsome roommate (who is over my shoulder telling me to add that right now). It's been a very depressing couple of weeks. 

After the huge buzz of figuring a part of myself was missing. I did get to feel pretty, female friends I told accepted me. Although I lost one close friend. Not for saying that I was trans, but because our relationship became too complicated sexually, but her support is very very missed. 

No one else knows, my facebook world doesn't. I posted this comic http://www.dumpaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/women-stripping-funny.jpg for a little context, I had been a burlesque performer and male stripper myself in the past. 

I instantly got jumped up and down upon by a person I have not met in real life. I was verbally attacked for being sexist, misogynistic and perpetuating issues of the male gaze, the down trodden nature the patriarchal society creates. I tried to explain that this comic is funny out of its reductive truth, there has been an evolution/de-evolution in society. I tried to justify expressing this side of my sense of humour without outing myself. 

But I felt destroyed as a male and questioned my acceptance as a possible female. I have since had nightmares being attacked by women. I discussed later with this same feminist about the their attitude to other women including black women, and LGBT. Lesbians seem to be accepted, everything else she stated as ""watering down the issue"", and ""they have their own groups for that"".

I've never been violent, aggressive or dominant. And have actually hated men myself for those very reasons. I had to move from a small rural area because I could not find a place or acceptance. Now I live in Melbourne, a capital city. I got into performance, and for the longest time got to express myself enough that I felt comfortable with myself. But I was secretly unhappy, conflicted and felt worthless I drank to numb anxiety. I got to perform in drag in a couple of burlesque shows and LOVED IT. Now I don't want to live artificial or heightened anymore. I want be me, fulltime, normal, real. But now that I've run up against females I thought were friends. Females posting very anti-male statements that I tried to call for some temperance on... only to be deleted. University friends stating some very firm men cause the problem statements, including one female friend I quite liked and am now scared of. I don't fear men when I come out, I've dealt my whole childhood not being accepted by men, so fuck that. I felt safe with women, I trusted women, I looked up to women for achieving and giving, but now?

Now I feel really uncomfortable with women and men. I hate me for being male and not being right in my body, and I'm scared of women for not accepting me as trans or as a woman, or hating both parts of me. The male me... the female me that doesn't think like them.

Yes these are huge psychological issues, I'm seeing a psychiatrist, I'm in an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Group. But I have no Trans or Genderqueer people to ask. 

I have decided to deactivate Facebook for now, it makes me angry that people are so maligned against each other. For gods sake we just want to be accepted by one another.

What do I do? Is it going to get easier? I've had a lesbian friend who when I came out to her told me I should do drag instead of transitioning. But I don't want to be accepted as a curio? A parody of a woman, a caricature? 

I'm feeling very alone. I've got a world of other questions, about hormones, therapy, clothes, make up, androgyne status. But right now I just want to know things can be ok. And that the little boy that felt he should be a girl isn't going to be put through the ringer...

I have since had nightmares being attacked by women. I discussed later with this same feminist about the their attitude to other women including black women, and LGBT. Lesbians seem to be accepted, everything else she stated as ""watering down the issue"", and ""they have their own groups for that"".\n\nI\'ve never been violent, aggressive or dominant. And have actually hated men myself for those very reasons. I had to move from a small rural area because I could not find a place or acceptance. Now I live in Melbourne, a capital city. I got into performance, and for the longest time got to express myself enough that I felt comfortable with myself. But I was secretly unhappy, conflicted and felt worthless I drank to numb anxiety. I got to perform in drag in a couple of burlesque shows and LOVED IT. Now I don\'t want to live artificial or heightened anymore. I want be me, fulltime, normal, real. But now that I\'ve run up against females I thought were friends. Females posting very anti-male statements that I tried to call for some temperance on... only to be deleted. University friends stating some very firm men cause the problem statements, including one female friend I quite liked and am now scared of. I don\'t fear men when I come out, I\'ve dealt my whole childhood not being accepted by men, so fuck that. I felt safe with women, I trusted women, I looked up to women for achieving and giving, but now?\n\nNow I feel really uncomfortable with women and men. I hate me for being male and not being right in my body, and I\'m scared of women for not accepting me as trans or as a woman, or hating both parts of me. The male me... the female me that doesn\'t think like them.\n\nYes these are huge psychological issues, I\'m seeing a psychiatrist, I\'m in an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Group. But I have no Trans or Genderqueer people to ask. \n\nI have decided to deactivate Facebook for now, it makes me angry that people are so maligned against each other. For gods sake we just want to be accepted by one another.\n\nWhat do I do? Is it going to get easier? I\'ve had a lesbian friend who when I came out to her told me I should do drag instead of transitioning. But I don\'t want to be accepted as a curio? A parody of a woman, a caricature? \n\nI\'m feeling very alone. I\'ve got a world of other questions, about hormones, therapy, clothes, make up, androgyne status. But right now I just want to know things can be ok. And that the little boy that felt he should be a girl isn\'t going to be put through the ringer...

55,2014-05-13 17:46:20,25grwj,14,8,"Hi!  I'm currently working on two brochures about genderqueer and nonbinary identities.  When they're done, they'll be put in my campus's lgbt resource room for students to read and/or take.  

One brochure is aimed towards college students who identify as genderqueer, and the other brochure is aimed towards the parents of these students, and is intended to be something that someone can give to their parents when they come out.  Both of them cover topics like gender v. sex, dysphoria, and the gender binary, and then they have special sections specifically for their intended audience.  The brochures are part of an activism project for my gender studies course.

I've got a lot of informational stuff, but what I really want is to put a personal touch on these.  I'd like some quotes that I can add to it.  I'm an androgyne (just came out to my parents this year too), and so I've got some of my experiences to share, but I'd really like to get stuff from a variety of people.  

For the parents' brochure, I especially need quotes for these sections:

What does it mean to be nonbinary?

Why is gender important?

What is dysphoria?

How do I support my child?

I will take any quotes at all, though.  The more, the better.  I don't want to invade anyone's privacy, so I won't ask for names with quotes.  Give me an alias if you want, otherwise I'll probably just toss a gender-neutral name next to it.  It'd be cool if I could add how you define your identity though, because I'd like to show the diversity of genderqueer identities.  

I'm planning on giving the parents' brochure to my parents when I'm finished, so this is really really important to me.  Please take a minute to just jot something down.  

TL;DR: Making brochures about genderqueer identities for college students and parents, please give me some quotes that I can put on there about what it's like to be genderqueer?

EDIT: Thanks for what you've given me so far!  I've added it to the brochure.  I could still use a lot more, so don't hesitate to offer more quotes.  I want to have a variety of voices.  I also still need quotes for the students' brochure- encouraging stuff, tips about presentation or anything that you wish someone had told you.

Essentially, what I'm writing about is about the *process* that you as an individual went through to figure out what your identity is (or how it is evolving). I'm specifically interested in the initial separation from the traditional gender identity/performance and what that process looked or felt like. This is a really huge topic that is only looked at on a large scale perspective but I'm more interested in individual accounts rather than the normal post-modernist queer theory approach (I think it is waaaay too generalizing trying to pinpoint a single modality (or method) of forming into a queer identifier).  

I don't know if I'm explaining what I want well enough, if there are any questions PLEASE comment or PM me.

BUT, a side effect of this is that most posts will inevitably show us the world in a negative light.  People need help with their battles, so it's the battles we hear about. People need to vent about the shitty, unjust stuff that's happened to them, so we hear about the shitty injustices.

In college my first boyfriend was very queer-friendly and also dug the androgynous look, but I also grew more into my body and discovered that I have pretty sizeable boobs and a very naturally feminine figure - hourglass curves and all. My face can still pass as fairly androgynous and I keep my hair short, but even binders don't do as good a job as I'd like keeping the rest of me even remotely non-female.

But that's not really the issue. I know how to dress to bring out my androgynous features and how to downplay my figure. The thing is, I started dating a guy two years ago, and it stuck. We live together now. He's fantastic, he helps me be who I want to be in almost every way, and he is by no means unsupportive... but he is also by no means attracted to androgyny or male features. He fucking loves my boobs more than anything else in the world, loves my curvy body, loves it when I occasionally wear skirts or dresses in hot weather, etc. He hates feeling like he's stifling me, but we've talked about this and he's admitted that while he still loves me, he is not particularly attracted to me sexually when I look androgynous. 

That's ok, I guess. I know I shouldn't compromise my identity for another person, and I don't think I am by much. But I definitely don't bind anymore, and my hair is at a length where it can look feminine unless I make it look otherwise. And mostly it's ok. But sometimes it hurts.

I dunno where I'm going with this. I have no one to talk to about it, I suppose. It's not his fault that he's attracted to women, that I happen to have a stupidly feminine figure, that when he met me I was feeling particularly girly. And he would absolutely not stop me from presenting however the fuck I want. 

I guess sometimes I just miss being with someone who loves and wants every single aspect of me. Maybe he would if I just gave him time? But maybe not, and that's ok.

104,2014-05-24 03:24:07,26co30,16,17,"Thanks for taking the time to read my post. I hope that posts like these are acceptable in this subreddit -- I haven't found any other subreddits that appear devoted to genderqueer discussions.

I am in a two-year long relationship with a [born-as] woman. We met on a dating site and I quickly fell in love: She is mega-intelligent, she is ultra-talented, she's hilarious, and she cuts a feminine figure that puts Venus to shame. 

As our relationship progressed, it became increasingly clear that she identified as a gay man in a woman's body. What started off as seemingly playful comments -- ""Man, I wish I had a penis! They're so fascinating!"" or ""I feel like a gay guy in a woman's body!"" -- evolved into a formal declaration of her gender/sexual identity. She admitted it earlier this year... and I had my suspicions for at least the past year, but I was unphased: I love her, she loves me, and I'd still love her if she came-out as an alien from the Andromeda galaxy. 

I wanted to completely understand her perspective and experiences, so we had a thorough talk about everything. She admitted to feeling bashful or displeased by her primary and secondary sex traits (which I had picked-up on for quite a while), she's into ladyboy/gay porn, she has a borderline obsessive fascination with penises, and her mind generally works similarly to a stereotypical male's mind (e.g. analytical, stoic, capable). She considered transitioning into a male body and embracing masculine traits/roles -- mistakenly believing that life is generally easier for guys than it is for gals -- but she came to realize that any socially-assigned gender comes with its commensurate baggage. In the end, she explained that she's moving forward in her biologically-assigned body, but embracing aspects of masculinity and femininity that she finds most appealing. Plus, this allows her to retain the nerve endings in her genitals... despite feeling like she missed out when God was handing-out penises. 

Initially, I was happy to know that she trusts me enough to be honest about such an important piece of her identity, and I was [selfishly] relieved that she wants to stay outwardly female. However, as much as I like to think I'm a progressive, flexible guy, I'm a pretty straightforward straight guy. I'm feeling some intense guilt and shame recently because it's become clear to me that a large part of my attraction to my partner is based on her biologically-assigned sex. It's also become clear that I'm not her preferred physical type, and I've realized that it's possible she would remain in our relationship despite the possibility that I'm not right for her. 

It's become increasingly difficult to have sex because I feel that it's at the expense of her dysphoria -- her body is amazing, but I know that the aspects I enjoy most are those that make her feel most self-conscious. When I bring this up with her, she explains that I'm free to enjoy her body... but I dunno, when she says that, it makes me think that the enjoyment is completely one-sided. It's difficult for me to get into sex if it feels like I'm the only one enjoying the experience... for better or worse, I feel terrible when I think that she bears with it because she wants me to be happy. Even when I manage to get my mind off of that aspect, I can't help but remember her preferred physical type. Like I mentioned earlier, she's a fan of guys with feminine physical characteristics: Less hair, thin and delicate builds, and gay. I'm the antithesis of this picture: I'm hairier than a testosterone factory, I'm built like a retired linebacker, and I'm straight.  

Apart from those gender/sexual-identity-related issues, there are some personality and behavioral observations that are beginning to concern me. 

First, she has said things in the past that make me worry that she settles for anyone who wants to date her... and this is reflected by a past history of remaining in long-term relationships with men who she can barely stand, who are abusive, or who are just downright disrespectful. She was engaged to a zealously religious man who intimidated her into sex; she dated a med student who was obsessed with sports, had anal sex with her when she slept, and who left her without saying a single word near their one-year anniversary; she dated a guy for months whose ADHD was so severe that she could barely stand his presence. In contrast, she is an atheist, she couldn't be less interested in sports or non-consensual sex, and her own diagnoses with OCD and Asperger's would make it very difficult to cope with someone with severe ADHD. In general, this worries me, because I can't be sure she genuinely loves me, or if she reciprocates because she feels I'm her only option. This also worries me because I don't want to cage her: if she's not into me, so be it, and I want her to be happy regardless who she's with. 

Second, she's often out-of-touch with the intuitive aspects of her mind -- i.e. emotions or self-awarenes. I think she's grown out-of-touch because, being an Aspie, she's grown accustomed to having her emotions invalidated and to being socially ostracized for simply being herself. When we have arguments, they are generally resolve in a positive manner: Our dual masculine natures push us towards objective, problem-solving-oriented solutions. However, she avoids confrontations like the plague, and it usually falls to me to detect something amiss in her mood or behavior. Sometimes, I feel like if I never even brought up our issues, she'd silently suffer through them for an indefinite time. This couples to my last point: Is she with me because she's genuinely attracted to me? Does she stay because she loves me, or because she doesn't want to rock the boat? Eventually, an issue will arise that I'll be completely unaware of, and that I'll be unable to detect -- What happens then?

Anyways, I guess I'm just looking for perspectives from others who identify similarly as my partner, or from those whose partners are GQ, or for links to resources that are not super-public-media-relationey.  I love my gf, and we are talking about these issues and communicating about them as best we can. However, it would really help me to put things into perspective if I could hear from those who have been on either side of this situation.

tl,dr; Girlfriend comes-out to me as genderqueer (born female, feels like a gay man), decides she wants move forward as her biologically-assigned sex, and I'm cool with that. However, I worry about antagonizing her dysphoria, I worry that I'm not her preferred physical type, and I worry that she's settling with me.

The local council has cut a large majority of the funding for its youth support. Although our LGBT youth worker's job is safe for the next 18 months, the building in which we meet will be shut and if another venue cannot be found, the group will go with it.

This is ridiculous. It's a decision made by middle class heterosexual men who have no experience or understanding of the difficulties growing up LGBTQ. A survey done by Metro found that 44% of LGBT young people have contemplated suicide and 52% have self harmed. (http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/25711600) As all of you know, we need the support and help that the youth service barely managed to provide now.

As young people, we attempting to fight this decision so I'm asking you to stand with us and other LGBTQ youth to show the Conservative Government how vital these services are.

In my own experience, I have no where else to go where I know people will call me by my chosen name. At least weekly I hear my mother refer to any form as queerness as 'sick' or 'perverse'. Youth groups allow people to find others that they relate to, that they understand. Through this service I have met other trans* people and I made friends who I know support me and respect my identity.

Since coming out as trans* I've had a long chat with my brother and then conferred with my parents and, we're still going to see a therapist, but I think I'm most probably gender fluid as I have had peak and troughs of dysphoria for ages suggesting I'm 'fluid' and the doubts I've been having this past week, and talk with my family, have confirmed that. However just a few questions:

Mainly, how can I express my gender if I'm feeling girly?  Obviously, begin maab it's harder for me to do that as people are more likely to stare and judge. Like if a faab wears men's clothes she can get away with that however it's a totally different story with a guy dressing in girls clothes so how can I express my gender on girly days without drawing too much attention to myself?

I could wear more flowery guy clothes and androgynous clothes but what kinda things are androgynous?  And what kind of girly clothes cold I get away with?  

Also my hair, I really want to grow it to a more gender neutral length but when my useless boys hair grows it grows out wards and all bushy, what can I do to get it to grow down?  Obviously a barber will be useless in circumstance so do I just take a picture of a desire hairstyle to a hairdressers/salon/stylist and said ""do this""?  

Finally on a different note, what of my sexuality?  I feel I'm mainly attracted to girls however I'm sure I'm asexual - the whole 'penis-in-vagina' thing just seems sickening and eww - so I'm worried I might never be able to get a girlfriend with my asexuality and gender fluidity - I mean who's going to want a boyfriend like that?!

130,2014-05-29 16:58:33,26sswb,2,6,"I'm 17, and I'm a confused boy (MAAB) in Norway. Maybe you can help me think, or at least let me vent my mind a bit (I've also never posted on Reddit before, so preemptive apologies for any mistakes)

Pretty recently in my life, about a bit over half a year ago, I met a genderqueer female in the Norwegian equivalent of High School. We quickly became good friends and I was introduced to her group of friends, whom I to this day frequently hang out with. Now, throughout a large portion of my life I had been toying with the thought of me, but with female aspects. I've also usually figured myself straight (because I knew I liked girls), but acknowledged to myself that there is a possibility of me being bisexual, even more so when I began experimenting with anal masturbation around a year and a half ago. Well, after I met this genderqueer girl (who are now one of my best friends) a lot of those thoughts blossomed again.

So I opened up much more and I began embracing those thoughts I occasionally had, about being feminine and about who I was. I ended up discovering an innate desire to be feminine. Of course, that made me pretty confused and insecure in regards to my identity and sexuality, and at this point I'm describing what I ""feel like"" as bigender and pansexual. At the end of December, whilst these ideas were still growing, I got into a relationship with a cis girl. Due to my insecurity I didn't tell her, partly because I was anxious and partly because I wasn't sure myself. After a couple of months (two-three months ago) I did tell her (but because of circumstances that were really unideal), and she ended up leaving me because she wasn't sure she could support my identity. I've mostly gotten past her now.

Present day, I'm starting to embrace my femininity. I'm not entirely content with my body shape and wish that I had more hips and a larger bottom. I'd also like to obtain breasts, though I'm not sure how I'd go about that. I'm strongly considering estrogen, but I'm not sure if I should wait 'till I get older, nor am I completely sure what it would accomplish. Cross-dressing is something I'd like to try out, and I would like to pursue more feminine/androgynous clothing (something I'm currently lacking). However, despite feeling as well as wanting to be feminine, *I don't want to abandon my masculinity either*. That is why I assume bigender to be the term that describes my identity the best. That said, the way I've understood it bigender implies that one ""switches"" gender, whilst I feel like I identify as both, leaning slightly towards feminine. 

In addition to that conundrum, there's also the matter of family. My parents divorced when I was one year old, and I lived with my mother since. She married again last year, and I have a good relationship with my step-dad. I don't think either of them are actually homo-phobic or the like, however, with me being pretty anxious and having a lack of self-confidence, I've only recently approached my mother about it, twice. And it went... not as great as it could have. The first time she reacted pretty badly, passive-aggressively questioning whether I wanted to dress in girls clothing, whether I was gay, etc. and she also stated that she didn't believe me because ""I was very boy-ish when I was a kid"". It felt pretty condescending. She occasionally mocked me afterwards, though I think it wasn't intentional and she did apologize when she realized what she was doing, but it still hurt. I did approach her a second time and tried to go as in-depth about my identity (and a little about my sexuality as well), and it went better, but while I think she now acknowledges it, I still don't think she really understands, nor do I feel like I have her support. This hasn't exactly made me more confident about opening up, and I don't feel like talking about it with my family more unless I have to.

**Edit; Kinda realized the title makes it sound like I ""started"" being genderqueer half a year ago, which isn't the case.

Hope that doesn't make too much confusion n.n''**",genderqueer,Half a year of genderqueer; Not sure if I'm bigender or something else,1401407913.0,"{'created_utc': 1401382713, 'id': '26sswb', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 6, 'selftext': 'I\'m 17, and I\'m a confused boy (MAAB) in Norway. Maybe you can help me think, or at least let me vent my mind a bit (I\'ve also never posted on Reddit before, so preemptive apologies for any mistakes)\n\nPretty recently in my life, about a bit over half a year ago, I met a genderqueer female in the Norwegian equivalent of High School. We quickly became good friends and I was introduced to her group of friends, whom I to this day frequently hang out with. Now, throughout a large portion of my life I had been toying with the thought of me, but with female aspects. I\'ve also usually figured myself straight (because I knew I liked girls), but acknowledged to myself that there is a possibility of me being bisexual, even more so when I began experimenting with anal masturbation around a year and a half ago. Well, after I met this genderqueer girl (who are now one of my best friends) a lot of those thoughts blossomed again.\n\nSo I opened up much more and I began embracing those thoughts I occasionally had, about being feminine and about who I was. I ended up discovering an innate desire to be feminine. Of course, that made me pretty confused and insecure in regards to my identity and sexuality, and at this point I\'m describing what I ""feel like"" as bigender and pansexual. At the end of December, whilst these ideas were still growing, I got into a relationship with a cis girl. Due to my insecurity I didn\'t tell her, partly because I was anxious and partly because I wasn\'t sure myself. After a couple of months (two-three months ago) I did tell her (but because of circumstances that were really unideal), and she ended up leaving me because she wasn\'t sure she could support my identity. I\'ve mostly gotten past her now.\n\nPresent day, I\'m starting to embrace my femininity. I\'m not entirely content with my body shape and wish that I had more hips and a larger bottom. I\'d also like to obtain breasts, though I\'m not sure how I\'d go about that. I\'m strongly considering estrogen, but I\'m not sure if I should wait \'till I get older, nor am I completely sure what it would accomplish. Cross-dressing is something I\'d like to try out, and I would like to pursue more feminine/androgynous clothing (something I\'m currently lacking). However, despite feeling as well as wanting to be feminine, *I don\'t want to abandon my masculinity either*. That is why I assume bigender to be the term that describes my identity the best. That said, the way I\'ve understood it bigender implies that one ""switches"" gender, whilst I feel like I identify as both, leaning slightly towards feminine. \n\nIn addition to that conundrum, there\'s also the matter of family. My parents divorced when I was one year old, and I lived with my mother since. She married again last year, and I have a good relationship with my step-dad. I don\'t think either of them are actually homo-phobic or the like, however, with me being pretty anxious and having a lack of self-confidence, I\'ve only recently approached my mother about it, twice. And it went... not as great as it could have. The first time she reacted pretty badly, passive-aggressively questioning whether I wanted to dress in girls clothing, whether I was gay, etc. and she also stated that she didn\'t believe me because ""I was very boy-ish when I was a kid"". It felt pretty condescending. She occasionally mocked me afterwards, though I think it wasn\'t intentional and she did apologize when she realized what she was doing, but it still hurt. I did approach her a second time and tried to go as in-depth about my identity (and a little about my sexuality as well), and it went better, but while I think she now acknowledges it, I still don\'t think she really understands, nor do I feel like I have her support. This hasn\'t exactly made me more confident about opening up, and I don\'t feel like talking about it with my family more unless I have to.\n\nAnyway, that\'s my story and situation.

So I'm maab, gender fluid, 17 and am just starting to get chest hair. This is awful :'( because when I'm feeling like a girl the hair is just dysphoria inducing and even when I'm feeling more boyish or neutral, it's still grim - looking at my brother it's just eww! I really want to remove the chest hair and think waxing will be the best way as I don't want to be shaving it every two days!. But a couple of concerns:

* how much is it to get your chest waxed?

* when should I? I'm guessing not until it's longer and I'm 18 but that still leaves the awkward conversation ""mum, could I get my chest waxed?"" and the possible piss taking which accompanies that from friends and family. How to come around this? (I've only just come out as trans* so she's a little on edge atm. Hopefully she'll calm down by time I have grown whack loads of chest hair and want it removing) 

* How long does it take grow back? Doesn't the intervals between regrowth get longer after each session?

* finally, how much does it hurt? :/
