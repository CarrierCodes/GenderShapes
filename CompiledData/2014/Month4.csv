So basically I completely severed all ties with my old life when I decided to transition. I haven't had contact with my family for years before that, no friends, and quit all jobs/commitments. I was completely free and ""lay low"" for over a year while I changed.

I reemerged a new person. I got a court ordered name change, got a new ID and new SS card, and began meeting people with my new identity. I couldn't be happier with my new life!

Now I need a job! And my first worry was a background check - will the old name/gender automatically pop up? I'm in a tough industry and it's hard enough to find a job without that added hurdle. So far what I have been doing is leaving blank the ""any former names or aliases"" space, and if it comes down to it, I can privately explain to the HR person what the situation is.

What's more concerning though is job references. I feel like I really should not have to call up employers that I haven't spoken to in years and tell them what I've done - I intentionally quit everything so nobody has to know and I want to keep it that way. I also don't feel it's best to tell every prospective employer what the deal is. They don't need a reason to turn me down or start gossip in such a narrow industry. 

What's terrible is I'm ""photoshopping"" my new name onto written references, and asking friends to fake being professional references. I know it's wrong and it really sucks when I know my past employers LOVED me, but I just can't bear to drag my old life into my new one.

I just want to start fresh. I've tried volunteering and getting ""under the table"" jobs just so SOMEONE who knows me by my new identity can vouch for me, but even that required references.

Last night Jamie and I attended a panel where several people spoke out about their identities and answered questions from the audience and just spread all sorts of knowledge about LGBTQ life. At the end, the professor who was hosting the panel asked the speakers to provide one final, brief piece of advice to anyone who may be questioning their identities. One person said, simply, ""live authentically"". I felt like those were very powerful words, and so I am writing this in an effort to do just that. 

It's been a rough few years - for all of us really, but especially myself as I have been on a journey to self discovery. I know you have all been worried about me for quite some time now, as I have struggled with depression, lack of self-confidence, low self-esteem, and what I recently learned is called ""dysphoria"". Over the past several months I have grown so much as a person, and my personal identity has finally taken some form. I know who I am, who I always was, and I want to share that with you all.

Some words I would use to describe myself are Trans* and genderqueer. These are terms that relate to gender identity. Gender identity is a person's private sense, and subjective experience, of their own gender. [Trans*](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/) is an umbrella term that encompasses all of the identities on the gender identity spectrum - more specifically it refers to an individual whose gender identity does not match their sex designated at birth. Genderqueer means non-normative or queer gender. The reason I relate to both of these is that my gender is neither female or male. I identify outside of the binary.

I kind of feel like this is such a personal thing, I shouldn't have to make an announcement. However, I want you all to understand who I am and get to know ME - the real me!


*“Real isn't how you are made,' said the Skin Horse. 'It's a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.'*

 *'Does it hurt?' asked the Rabbit.*

 *'Sometimes,' said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. 'When you are Real you don't mind being hurt.'*

 *'Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,' he asked, 'or bit by bit?'*

 *'It doesn't happen all at once,' said the Skin Horse. 'You become. It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.”* **― Margery Williams, The Velveteen Rabbit**


I do not expect you all to agree with, accept, or support me, but it is important to me that you respect my identity by using my chosen name (Emery) and neutral pronouns, honorifics, and familial terms. For example, I prefer they/them/theirs rather than the traditional female pronouns, child rather than daughter, and sibling rather than sister. If you cannot think of a neutral form, I am much more comfortable being referred to in the masculine sense - nephew rather than niece.

I appreciate you all taking the time to read this and wrap your head around what it all means. I love you guys very much. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask. I have a metric TON of resources that I can provide you with. 

I want to leave you with a video that changed my life. I am not even joking here. Get your tissues ready because I can almost guarantee you will need them at some point (yes, even you boys). [Andrew Solomon](http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_love_no_matter_what) shares his thoughts on that fine line between unconditional love, and unconditional acceptance. I hope that this will help you understand a little bit better.

15,2014-04-04 05:26:32,22645v,6,7,"So, I came out to my roommate a few weeks ago, and it went really well. He just had a lot of questions, and I had to come up with some answers. He didn't quite understand what it was that was happening and how I could even fathom what it's like to be a boy, seeing as I've never been one. 

I have a feeling that reasonable cis/non-trans people would ask this question-- I would. How do you know you're a boy/girl? What brought you to this conclusion? What does it mean to be ""assigned the wrong body""? The first night he asked these questions, I stumbled. It was always just something I knew-- you know? I just felt it. HOWEVER, this isn't enough. This still leaves questions. Just saying ""This is something I feel,"" and not opening up a discussion or allowing questions just makes it something to humour. Makes this very real... Thing that I'm going through unrelatable. While he never really could understand without being trans himself, I tried for a very long time to make it something that he could understand. We started talking about it again today, and the questions resurfaced. ""But how did you know?"" 

After a few hums, I finally came to this explanation. 

I asked if he had ever felt uncomfortable somewhere. Like a social gathering where he didn't belong. I said that it wasn't that I knew what it felt like to be a boy, it was that I felt as though this body is not where I belong. That I am uncomfortable in my body, and not in the way that, say a short person would want to be taller. That my genitalia and very prominent chest are actually causing me unease because this is not where I belong. 

Immediately after this conversation came to a close, I ran here, to Reddit. I wanted to (I guess) brag about how I've finally managed to answers some pretty important questions. I'm still so new to this. But it's good to have this for future q&amp;a sessions with the people who are just curious.

29,2014-04-07 02:06:37,22e4er,11,11,"Hi! AMAB here, I'm going with Androgyne or just simply genderqueer for now - I'm still figuring my headspace out. I've lurked here since about Christmas on and off, reading other people's experiences and stuff. I've been questioning for a long time, nothing too serious but I've always been attracted to crossdressing since I was about thirteen and I've tried it on and off with the help of a couple of female friends, been made up only once. It's a little sexual, a little fun, and the rest is because I feel as though presenting acting and generally being feminine to be how I would feel most happy about myself (at least in looks, the stuff in my head is whatever I feel like... I just wanna be cute).

I was always just 'me', never really considered any of this or associated strongly with either of the binaries and I didn't consider it until I started beginning to seriously want to change my life for the better and improve myself as a person as I've been pretty ill for a couple of years (ulcerative colitis and M.E/chronic fatigue) and my entire life just kind of stopped - overall I was very unhappy in general and with myself, although I now know that was down to dysphoria (at least in part, of that I'm really sure).

If you asked me why exactly I feel the way I do, I really don't think I could explain. I've been using a metaphor with a box full of pink and blue marbles that's been shaken up, and all the marbles gently intermingle with each other day to day. It's not a sudden mixing or switching in how I feel about my gender, it's just a slow constant thing. It doesn't bother me too much, I just wish with all my heart I could appear female or feminine (I like clothes a lot, also thigh socks!). I'm fine with how I was born, I'm content with all the plumbing. I want to look and feel cute, and if people misgendering me and thinking I'm female is a secondary bonus then, well I'm pretty okay with that - although I should clarify that in my head I feel as though I'm pretty solidly in the middle of male and female with a minor feminine bias that comes and goes.

And on to the crossdressing/femininity part! I am not even going to try any of this if I can't pull off looking like a girl - I don't want to be a guy in makeup and a dress because I'm not confident at all and I'm really socially awkward/anxious, paranoid in public (I know that will get better with time, but it's really fucking terrifying for me). Anyway, ignoring the fact that I basically haven't moved in a year and a half to two years due to various health problems (thus having gained weight), I'm looking for pointers on a lot of things. Right now I feel my biggest challenge is getting to be the shape I want to be (IE skinny and one that will fit into &amp; look good in feminine/girls clothing) and finding a style of clothes that works on me. Also, my hair is really curly and goes afro-like when it's longer, but I'd like long hair (middle back or something, but all together and flowy... like feminine kind of curly hair, actually!). While I'm on the subject of hair, my legs are hairy (obviously) and the epilator I tried is unusably painful (I cried, I can't use it at all). I've seen the other thread with the tutorial in it though, so I'm going to look into that!

While I know this was probably a super long read, I'm so grateful to anybody that replies - I'm really picky about my friends and I'm uncomfortable in person around people that aren't my friends (or I would've gone to the LGBTQ group in my college - maybe in the future, just not now. I'd like to be a bit surer of myself). I'm going to look into finding a therapist, too. I'm really nervous around my friends and family because this is so new, I've always dressed and behaved the same way for YEARS. It's new territory, so any help I can get from impartial sources would be great. &lt;3

That's actually where I was first exposed to non-binary genders, and where people helped me understand and accept who I am. If anyone else here goes on tumblr, some of this might sound familiar, but I just wanted other opinions from different people.

I personally use they pronouns. They're easy to remember, for me and others, and I feel like they are probably a little less confusing than pronouns like zi/xi. They pronouns just feel more comfortable for me overall.

During my time on tumblr, however, I've seen people make up their own pronouns, and use pronouns that are derived from other things (I'll explain more a bit later).

At first, I thought it was weird to make up your own pronouns, especially when there seems to be quite a few already that people can use other than he/she. I thought making up your own pronouns sounded more like a way to stand out and be a ""special snowflake"". But a friend of mine changed pronouns to something completely unique, something they had made up themselves. The pronouns are reasonable, nothing crazy, and works really well. In fact, I find it less confusing than zi/xi, and sounds a lot nicer/smoother. (I'd say what they are, but I'm going to try and keep this anonymous) That's when I started accepting that, hey, if it makes you feel comfortable, then that's fine!

The other thing though, that I'm not sure how to feel about, is pronouns that seem to come from random words. There was a list a couple months ago of pronouns for people to use.

I've seen people who loved them, and I've seen people who say that they sound more like a way to be ""cutesy"", or pronouns for *anyone* to use,and that its making light or joking about gender identities.

I’m AMAB, but I’ve been having trouble with my gender. 

A couple of years ago, I briefly believed I was a trans woman, because of my desire to have an AFAB body. However, I realised I hadn’t properly understood what that meant, and went back to ID’ing as cis. But recently, after talking to my friend, I realised I might actually be slightly non-binary. I do still have that desire, and sometimes there are occasions when I feel like a girl rather than a guy. But I have no idea if this means anything, because I don’t know what it feels like for real non-binary people. 

I also want to own and wear more “women’s” clothes, but not overly feminine ones like skirts or dresses. But I don’t know if that’s just because I don’t like the way my body would look in them. I also have a strong desire to have a “female body” (I really can’t think of a better term rn) and be in a same-gender relationship. I’ve been refraining from ID’ing as anything other than cis because I don’t know if this desire constitutes actual dysphoria (because the body I have doesn’t always fit with my gender) or if I’m just a guy who’s unhappy with his body. 

With regards to my gender, there are also times when I sometimes refer to myself as a girl in conversation, such as wondering what it would be like if I were the only girl in my flat, but that may just be a desire to distance myself from the guys in my flat. Sometimes I regard the guys and girls in my flat as two groups, with me separate from either of them, but that may just be because I’m antisocial. 

So basically my question is – and I realise this is probably one y'all can’t actually answer – am I cis or not? And if not, is there a term for this particular kind of identity?

68,2014-04-17 13:11:15,239kvy,3,15,"Hi, I had always felt some gender dysmorphia since as far back as I can remember. It's something that remained far back in my mind for so long (I'm 23 now) but since discovering concepts like gender fluidity I immediately knew that was for me. This was about 3 months ago.

My fiancée has been really accepting of this so far but admits she doesn't really understand transgender issues. She's accommodating and supportive, even to the extent of helping me with research about things like breast binding and adopting my preferred gender pronouns when I feel masculine, neither or both.

From her perspective, she admits she feels like she's still in love with a woman who's ""acting out"" a different gender identity. She's admitted that in bed, she's been happy with this because she finds gender play a big turn on.

I've accepted this, I love her completely and we've been together since we first met at university nearly 5 years ago. I don't need her to understand, just accept and support.

When I came out as genderqueer, I came out as a genderfluid woman (I'm normally in a feminine mode, ranging from very feminine to my normal tomboyish phase) but for a variety of reasons, most recently a  sense of disillusionment with feminism and gender politics, I want to identify as fully genderqueer, not as a genderfluid woman.

My worry is am I just moving too fast? In these past months, this has felt nothing but completely right like I've found the language for my thoughts and feelings.

I'm a little scared of fully coming out to my fiancée too. Our relationship is very strong and we're devoting more spare time together over the next year, we both feel we're perfect for each other. Should I ease her into this or is it better to just come out and say it?

She's been accepting but never really understood things like how I could be attracted to a MAAB genderqueer person but not a cisgender man or transman. I think for her, gender = physical sex.

Even though it's easy to say ""Gender is subjective and being ____ doesn't mean you're masculine / being ___ doesn't mean you're feminine,"" it doesn't really seem to make a difference when you're faced with the sort of majority-rule idea of gender roles.  All the women (cis and trans alike)  bonding over things like bobby pins and going to the bathroom in herds and gossip and emotions, and all the men bonding over the equivalent stereotypically masculine stuff (some examples I saw were ""memorizing facts/statistics,"" ""walking awkwardly when they think girls are looking at them,"" and ""presenting solutions when a girlfriend has a problem, not emotional support."") It seems much easier for people to agree on those and relate to each other, and they seem happy with that identification.

I know it's all culturally based, and not biological, but it still makes me uncomfortable. I'm FAAB, and people always say ""Well, you can still be a woman and not be stereotypically feminine blah blah blah"" but then, how do transwomen know they're women / transmen know they're men, if gender is just a social construct? am I just missing the Thing inside my head that says ""I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN/MAN/____""?

Sometimes I think I might be a transman, but then I realize that what I am feeling isn't an identification with the male gender, but a lack of identification with the female gender (which is the one I got born into and so it's been expected of me a lot more).

(Still sorta recovering from my first run-ins with /r/theredpill, /r/beatingwomen, and the other assorted hellholes pockmarking this site.) I'm a 21-year old FAAB who's been contending with gender confusion since early childhood. As a youngster, I was averse to ""girly"" trappings--most of my favorite toys were gender-neutral, and dresses (and the like) always incited a very *visceral* sort of discomfort. I was a pretty timid/passive little kid, though, so I seldom complained when Mom suited me up in the stuff. As puberty approached, and most of my peers outgrew their ""tomboy"" tendencies, I clung to the vestiges of my childhood, presenting myself neutrally and concerning myself *chiefly* with goofy writing and art (while shoving aside my mounting insecurities and ignoring all that nutty ""burgeoning body"" stuff the school nurses rattled on about). It wasn't until a *few* years ago that I really confronted the matter of my identity head-on. I knew I struggled to think of myself as ""female"" (in any conventional sense)--but why? Was it some sorta weird psychological condition? Was I wrestling with deep-seated suppression? Was I a lesbian? A little online exploration and contact with the LGBTQ community helped to assuage some of my uncertainties; and I came to consider myself genderqueer.

Suffice to say, this lifted a big weight off my back--but plenty of concerns still linger. I seem to be attracted to males, but male *attention* (ogling/lustful glances on the street) makes me very uncomfortable; *too* aware of my physical femininity. (I *assume* those folks are reading me as female, anyway; I strive for androgyny and--eventually--a relationship that functions *outside* the conventional boy-girl dynamic.) I experience some bodily dysphoria, but (ultimately) not enough to merit the expense and risk of surgery.

I had this very long diatribe, of ""Poor me, Would have been beaten into submission if I didn't hide my whole life"" story, but in reality my own fear has kept me from exploring/expressing my gender identity for my whole life.  I'm gay and I'm happy with that, I'm also a bottom, and its been a long road but I'm happy with that too, now after years of therapy and ""self improvement"" I feel I'm finally ready to deal with the dysphoria that I have been feeling my whole life, but never was able to identify.  I love being male, I love my penis but that's about it.  I hate everything about how ""masculine"" I present myself.  I have been doing so out of fear for so many years that I feel I can't stop, I'm stuck behind the mask so to speak.  To give an idea of what its like for me, think ""pretty Femboi"" stuck in Fred Savages body.  I'm hairy and balding, and although I'm losing weight, I still hate my body.  I've always felt like I needed to be able to be more feminine and androgynous.  I hate being sooo male. I know that there are many options to do, waxing, laser for body hair, clothing and such, which I have been introducing.  But my real problem comes from this... How do you after so many years of being one way, start being another? With friends, family, elderly parents, work (I work around kids and fear parents freaking out ""get that queer away from my child"" type thing)... in other words how do you integrate being non-binary into an adult life?  It's not as simple as dying my hair (which I don't have ;P) and acting differently in homeroom (not that I'm trying to trivialize expressing yourself in youth, god knows I didn't have the courage to do so)... But there are different concerns at my age. Are there any ""adults"" who have gone through something similar?  I'm lucky to have a group of friends and even family who would accept anything, but really what do I do? Do I come out? Do I slowly change until someone asks? And also how do I find where I fall on the spectrum, not male but not female but also not in the middle, more towards male but not exactly?? WTF?

I had this very long diatribe, of ""Poor me, Would have been beaten into submission if I didn\'t hide my whole life"" story, but in reality my own fear has kept me from exploring/expressing my gender identity for my whole life.  I\'m gay and I\'m happy with that, I\'m also a bottom, and its been a long road but I\'m happy with that too, now after years of therapy and ""self improvement"" I feel I\'m finally ready to deal with the dysphoria that I have been feeling my whole life, but never was able to identify.  I love being male, I love my penis but that\'s about it.  I hate everything about how ""masculine"" I present myself.  I have been doing so out of fear for so many years that I feel I can\'t stop, I\'m stuck behind the mask so to speak.  To give an idea of what its like for me, think ""pretty Femboi"" stuck in Fred Savages body.  I\'m hairy and balding, and although I\'m losing weight, I still hate my body.  I\'ve always felt like I needed to be able to be more feminine and androgynous.  I hate being sooo male. I know that there are many options to do, waxing, laser for body hair, clothing and such, which I have been introducing.  But my real problem comes from this... How do you after so many years of being one way, start being another? With friends, family, elderly parents, work (I work around kids and fear parents freaking out ""get that queer away from my child"" type thing)... in other words how do you integrate being non-binary into an adult life?  It\'s not as simple as dying my hair (which I don\'t have ;P) and acting differently in homeroom (not that I\'m trying to trivialize expressing yourself in youth, god knows I didn\'t have the courage to do so)... But there are different concerns at my age. Are there any ""adults"" who have gone through something similar?  I\'m lucky to have a group of friends and even family who would accept anything, but really what do I do? Do I come out? Do I slowly change until someone asks? And also how do I find where I fall on the spectrum, not male but not female but also not in the middle, more towards male but not exactly?? WTF?

98,2014-04-27 08:40:27,243dp7,8,13,"I apologize in advance if this is disorganized...I've got a lot of thoughts and I'm just going to do this stream-of-consciousness. 

I'm 23 years old and biologically female. In the past year or so, I've been thinking more about my gender identity, and in the past few weeks I've been thinking about it pretty much constantly. I think I might be genderqueer/genderfluid, but I'm not sure and I'm not sure if I'm ready to identify that way.

Recently, I've been thinking about all the ways I've disliked being female. The earliest memory is when I was maybe 4, and I was in the car with my mother, and I wanted to take my shirt off, and my mother didn't want me to, but relented because we were in the car and nobody would see. But of course as we pulled into our street, a bunch of my neighbors were there, and my mom stopped to chat with other parents. I distinctly remember another girl peering into the car, frowning. I don't know if she was frowning because I had my shirt off, or for some other reason, but her frown stuck with me. Afterwards, my mother told me that I had to keep a shirt on because other people had seen me.

I didn't have a lot of trouble with gender roles growing up, mainly because my mom is a 1960s/1970s feminist, and whenever people said that girls couldn't do something, she called it ""old-fashioned thinking.""

When I got older, I had more reasons to be jealous of boys. The ability to pee standing up was one of them, but relatively minor. When I was 11, I was diagnosed with trichotillomania, which is a compulsive hair-pulling disorder. I envied the fact that boys could shave their heads. I currently have managed to grow out the hair at the back of my head, and I've decided I like it long in the back and short in front, except that whenever I get stressed and pull my hair out it gets patchy and I don't like that. But I feel the short in front long in back style kind of fits my identity.

Around the time guys my age started hitting their growth spurts, I got jealous of their height. I remember in particular, one of my friends had been taller than I was until I hit my growth spurt, and when I hit my growth spurt and was finally taller than he was, I was really proud, until of course he hit his growth spurt and was once again taller than I was and I got jealous. Oh, and I also remember in kindergarten, not being allowed to have a sleepover with this same friend because ""boys and girls have different body parts.""

When I learned to like football, I was jealous that boys could play it and I couldn't, and in general I'm jealous of the muscles that men can develop. I work out a fair amount, but I can't reach the muscle size of guys that also work out. My boyfriend is a runner, and doesn't do much arm work, and my biceps are larger than his. I am very proud of this fact. He also does some ab work, and is naturally really skinny, and recently mentioned that he thought he was starting to get a six-pack. And my reaction was jealousy.

I find a lot of gay men attractive, and have on a couple occasions, had crushes on guys I didn't know were gay. I'm only attracted to men though, but including non-binary genders I'd say they have to be biologically male, but not identify as female. I recently discovered the term androphilic and am very happy about having discovered this term. I'm also scared about how my boyfriend might react if I started identifying as other than a cisgender female. We've been dating for 3 1/2 years, so I'm pretty invested in this relationship.

A fairly new issue I'm having is with clothing. I never really had problems with wearing feminine clothing before, but recently I've been having days where I absolutely do not want to wear skirts, dresses, or anything form-fitting. But other days I enjoy wearing feminine clothes. One of the days that I didn't feel like wearing dresses, I had a presentation that required I dress up, and my nice pants were dirty, so I had to wear a dress and by the end of the day, I was very cranky. But then I finally got to go home and change, and I felt so much better. I think this may have been triggered by my discovery of the wonderful thing that is the ""bro tank,"" which shows off my biceps, but doesn't make me look super-feminine. I need more of those.

One thing I'm happy about with being biologically female is the ability to get pregnant and give birth. Also I like to paint my nails. I can't think of a whole lot of other things, though. 

I'm kind of confused/questioning as to how I actually identify, though. Maybe I'm just a woman who doesn't like traditional gender roles. But maybe there's something more, like some days I'm feminine and some days I'm androgynous. I wouldn't say there are ever times where I would fully identify as male, though. Sometimes I feel as if I'm feminine too often to identify as genderqueer, or I'm not genderqueer enough, if that makes any sense. But I've been spending a lot of time thinking about it, so maybe that in itself is an indicator that I might be genderqueer.

So this is a question somehow. I want more information than I've been able to find on my own. Also, I just wanted to talk to somebody about it, but I don't feel comfortable talking with most people I know until I'm a little more sure about my identity. Maybe all I really needed was to write this and get it off my chest and I'll feel fine about everything tomorrow. That would be nice.

I was at my local equivalent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, getting a license renewed, and the guy processing my paperwork tells me the computer has me listed as female, which he said was odd because I'm clearly male.

""Ey, you a boy'r girl'r what?"" he was slurring pretty bad. 

Taking this as an opportunity (I don't talk about my gender with many people) I took a beat and said ""Neither."" 

Even more confusion in those drunk eyes. ""Huh? You can't be neither, ya gotta pick one!"" 

""Not necessarily."" He's not getting it. Not ready to explain the complexities of gender identity and social constructs to a drunkard, I simply said ""I make my own rules!"" 

His face instantly lit up in a big, shit-eating, toothless grin, and started laughing. 

""Hahaha hey I like that! You make your own rules!"" He kept laughing about it to himself. 
Several minutes pass until the max shows up, then before I get on he comes up to me and says:

""Boy or Girl or what, you're kinda hot!""

It left me floored. Not that I would typically go looking for inebriated compliments from men who haven't showered in days, but it was such a simple interaction that ended so harmoniously.

Last night Jamie and I attended a panel where several people spoke out about their identities and answered questions from the audience and just spread all sorts of knowledge about LGBTQ life. At the end, the professor who was hosting the panel asked the speakers to provide one final, brief piece of advice to anyone who may be questioning their identities. One person said, simply, ""live authentically"". I felt like those were very powerful words, and so I am writing this in an effort to do just that. 

It's been a rough few years - for all of us really, but especially myself as I have been on a journey to self discovery. I know you have all been worried about me for quite some time now, as I have struggled with depression, lack of self-confidence, low self-esteem, and what I recently learned is called ""dysphoria"". Over the past several months I have grown so much as a person, and my personal identity has finally taken some form. I know who I am, who I always was, and I want to share that with you all.

Some words I would use to describe myself are Trans* and genderqueer. These are terms that relate to gender identity. Gender identity is a person's private sense, and subjective experience, of their own gender. [Trans*](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/) is an umbrella term that encompasses all of the identities on the gender identity spectrum - more specifically it refers to an individual whose gender identity does not match their sex designated at birth. Genderqueer means non-normative or queer gender. The reason I relate to both of these is that my gender is neither female or male. I identify outside of the binary.

I kind of feel like this is such a personal thing, I shouldn't have to make an announcement. However, I want you all to understand who I am and get to know ME - the real me!

That's why it doesn't happen often to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand.”* **― Margery Williams, The Velveteen Rabbit**


I do not expect you all to agree with, accept, or support me, but it is important to me that you respect my identity by using my chosen name (Emery) and neutral pronouns, honorifics, and familial terms. For example, I prefer they/them/theirs rather than the traditional female pronouns, child rather than daughter, and sibling rather than sister. If you cannot think of a neutral form, I am much more comfortable being referred to in the masculine sense - nephew rather than niece.

I appreciate you all taking the time to read this and wrap your head around what it all means. I love you guys very much. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask. I have a metric TON of resources that I can provide you with. 

I want to leave you with a video that changed my life. I am not even joking here. Get your tissues ready because I can almost guarantee you will need them at some point (yes, even you boys).

Because I live a pretty independent life as an adult, it has made it pretty easy for me to explore my identity over the past couple of years, and yet remain entire in the closet. I have gotten to a point where I am comfortable with who I am, and I\'m ready to share that with the rest of the world. \n\nTonight I am going to post a note on Facebook (because that is the place where my friends and family are most active). I wanted to share what I have drafted here, to get thoughts/comments/opinions etc. I tried to be brief, and keep it simple while still providing a clear picture of what is going on. Please let me know what you think, and wish me luck!!\n\n***\n\nLast night Jamie and I attended a panel where several people spoke out about their identities and answered questions from the audience and just spread all sorts of knowledge about LGBTQ life. At the end, the professor who was hosting the panel asked the speakers to provide one final, brief piece of advice to anyone who may be questioning their identities. One person said, simply, ""live authentically"". I felt like those were very powerful words, and so I am writing this in an effort to do just that. \n\nIt\'s been a rough few years - for all of us really, but especially myself as I have been on a journey to self discovery. I know you have all been worried about me for quite some time now, as I have struggled with depression, lack of self-confidence, low self-esteem, and what I recently learned is called ""dysphoria"". Over the past several months I have grown so much as a person, and my personal identity has finally taken some form. I know who I am, who I always was, and I want to share that with you all.\n\nSome words I would use to describe myself are Trans* and genderqueer. These are terms that relate to gender identity. Gender identity is a person\'s private sense, and subjective experience, of their own gender. [Trans*](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2012/05/what-does-the-asterisk-in-trans-stand-for/) is an umbrella term that encompasses all of the identities on the gender identity spectrum - more specifically it refers to an individual whose gender identity does not match their sex designated at birth. Genderqueer means non-normative or queer gender. The reason I relate to both of these is that my gender is neither female or male. I identify outside of the binary.\n\nI kind of feel like this is such a personal thing, I shouldn\'t have to make an announcement. However, I want you all to understand who I am and get to know ME - the real me!\n\n\n*“Real isn\'t how you are made,\' said the Skin Horse. \'It\'s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.\'*\n\n *\'Does it hurt?\' asked the Rabbit.*\n\n *\'Sometimes,\' said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. \'When you are Real you don\'t mind being hurt.\'*\n\n *\'Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,\' he asked, \'or bit by bit?\'*\n\n *\'It doesn\'t happen all at once,\' said the Skin Horse. \'You become.

17,2014-04-04 05:26:32,22645v,6,7,"So, I came out to my roommate a few weeks ago, and it went really well. He just had a lot of questions, and I had to come up with some answers. He didn't quite understand what it was that was happening and how I could even fathom what it's like to be a boy, seeing as I've never been one. 

I have a feeling that reasonable cis/non-trans people would ask this question-- I would. How do you know you're a boy/girl? What brought you to this conclusion? What does it mean to be ""assigned the wrong body""? The first night he asked these questions, I stumbled. It was always just something I knew-- you know? I just felt it. HOWEVER, this isn't enough. This still leaves questions. Just saying ""This is something I feel,"" and not opening up a discussion or allowing questions just makes it something to humour. Makes this very real...

We started talking about it again today, and the questions resurfaced. ""But how did you know?"" 

After a few hums, I finally came to this explanation. 

I asked if he had ever felt uncomfortable somewhere. Like a social gathering where he didn't belong. I said that it wasn't that I knew what it felt like to be a boy, it was that I felt as though this body is not where I belong. That I am uncomfortable in my body, and not in the way that, say a short person would want to be taller. That my genitalia and very prominent chest are actually causing me unease because this is not where I belong.

For the past few years I've been trying to figure myself out. Some things have been easier than others. But there is one thing I just have no idea how to even begin to approach.
I am both attracted to and want to be like lesbians with traditionally masculine characteristics (e.g. short hair). I identify strongly with lesbians, the lesbian cultural experience and lesbian sexuality. A butch lesbian, especially one who defies all gender norms, fills me with a strange sense of arousal and envy.

34,2014-04-07 02:06:37,22e4er,11,11,"Hi! AMAB here, I'm going with Androgyne or just simply genderqueer for now - I'm still figuring my headspace out. I've lurked here since about Christmas on and off, reading other people's experiences and stuff. I've been questioning for a long time, nothing too serious but I've always been attracted to crossdressing since I was about thirteen and I've tried it on and off with the help of a couple of female friends, been made up only once. It's a little sexual, a little fun, and the rest is because I feel as though presenting acting and generally being feminine to be how I would feel most happy about myself (at least in looks, the stuff in my head is whatever I feel like... I just wanna be cute).

I was always just 'me', never really considered any of this or associated strongly with either of the binaries and I didn't consider it until I started beginning to seriously want to change my life for the better and improve myself as a person as I've been pretty ill for a couple of years (ulcerative colitis and M.E/chronic fatigue) and my entire life just kind of stopped - overall I was very unhappy in general and with myself, although I now know that was down to dysphoria (at least in part, of that I'm really sure).

If you asked me why exactly I feel the way I do, I really don't think I could explain. I've been using a metaphor with a box full of pink and blue marbles that's been shaken up, and all the marbles gently intermingle with each other day to day. It's not a sudden mixing or switching in how I feel about my gender, it's just a slow constant thing. It doesn't bother me too much, I just wish with all my heart I could appear female or feminine (I like clothes a lot, also thigh socks!). I'm fine with how I was born, I'm content with all the plumbing. I want to look and feel cute, and if people misgendering me and thinking I'm female is a secondary bonus then, well I'm pretty okay with that - although I should clarify that in my head I feel as though I'm pretty solidly in the middle of male and female with a minor feminine bias that comes and goes.

And on to the crossdressing/femininity part! I am not even going to try any of this if I can't pull off looking like a girl - I don't want to be a guy in makeup and a dress because I'm not confident at all and I'm really socially awkward/anxious, paranoid in public (I know that will get better with time, but it's really fucking terrifying for me). Anyway, ignoring the fact that I basically haven't moved in a year and a half to two years due to various health problems (thus having gained weight), I'm looking for pointers on a lot of things. Right now I feel my biggest challenge is getting to be the shape I want to be (IE skinny and one that will fit into &amp; look good in feminine/girls clothing) and finding a style of clothes that works on me. Also, my hair is really curly and goes afro-like when it's longer, but I'd like long hair (middle back or something, but all together and flowy... like feminine kind of curly hair, actually!). While I'm on the subject of hair, my legs are hairy (obviously) and the epilator I tried is unusably painful (I cried, I can't use it at all). I've seen the other thread with the tutorial in it though, so I'm going to look into that!

While I know this was probably a super long read, I'm so grateful to anybody that replies - I'm really picky about my friends and I'm uncomfortable in person around people that aren't my friends (or I would've gone to the LGBTQ group in my college - maybe in the future, just not now. I'd like to be a bit surer of myself). I'm going to look into finding a therapist, too. I'm really nervous around my friends and family because this is so new, I've always dressed and behaved the same way for YEARS. It's new territory, so any help I can get from impartial sources would be great. &lt;3

That's actually where I was first exposed to non-binary genders, and where people helped me understand and accept who I am. If anyone else here goes on tumblr, some of this might sound familiar, but I just wanted other opinions from different people.

I personally use they pronouns. They're easy to remember, for me and others, and I feel like they are probably a little less confusing than pronouns like zi/xi. They pronouns just feel more comfortable for me overall.

During my time on tumblr, however, I've seen people make up their own pronouns, and use pronouns that are derived from other things (I'll explain more a bit later).

At first, I thought it was weird to make up your own pronouns, especially when there seems to be quite a few already that people can use other than he/she. I thought making up your own pronouns sounded more like a way to stand out and be a ""special snowflake"". But a friend of mine changed pronouns to something completely unique, something they had made up themselves. The pronouns are reasonable, nothing crazy, and works really well. In fact, I find it less confusing than zi/xi, and sounds a lot nicer/smoother. (I'd say what they are, but I'm going to try and keep this anonymous) That's when I started accepting that, hey, if it makes you feel comfortable, then that's fine!

The other thing though, that I'm not sure how to feel about, is pronouns that seem to come from random words. There was a list a couple months ago of pronouns for people to use. These pronouns were different, and some of the ones I can remember are things like ""pri/prin/prinself"" (coming from ""princess""), ""ham/hams/hamself"", paw/paws/pawself, dra/drag/dragself (from dragon), and a BUNCH of others. 

I've seen people who loved them, and I've seen people who say that they sound more like a way to be ""cutesy"", or pronouns for *anyone* to use,and that its making light or joking about gender identities.

I’m AMAB, but I’ve been having trouble with my gender. 

A couple of years ago, I briefly believed I was a trans woman, because of my desire to have an AFAB body. However, I realised I hadn’t properly understood what that meant, and went back to ID’ing as cis. But recently, after talking to my friend, I realised I might actually be slightly non-binary. I do still have that desire, and sometimes there are occasions when I feel like a girl rather than a guy. But I have no idea if this means anything, because I don’t know what it feels like for real non-binary people. 

I also want to own and wear more “women’s” clothes, but not overly feminine ones like skirts or dresses. But I don’t know if that’s just because I don’t like the way my body would look in them. I also have a strong desire to have a “female body” (I really can’t think of a better term rn) and be in a same-gender relationship. I’ve been refraining from ID’ing as anything other than cis because I don’t know if this desire constitutes actual dysphoria (because the body I have doesn’t always fit with my gender) or if I’m just a guy who’s unhappy with his body. 

With regards to my gender, there are also times when I sometimes refer to myself as a girl in conversation, such as wondering what it would be like if I were the only girl in my flat, but that may just be a desire to distance myself from the guys in my flat. Sometimes I regard the guys and girls in my flat as two groups, with me separate from either of them, but that may just be because I’m antisocial. 

So basically my question is – and I realise this is probably one y'all can’t actually answer – am I cis or not? And if not, is there a term for this particular kind of identity?

85,2014-04-17 13:11:15,239kvy,3,15,"Hi, I had always felt some gender dysmorphia since as far back as I can remember. It's something that remained far back in my mind for so long (I'm 23 now) but since discovering concepts like gender fluidity I immediately knew that was for me. This was about 3 months ago.

My fiancée has been really accepting of this so far but admits she doesn't really understand transgender issues. She's accommodating and supportive, even to the extent of helping me with research about things like breast binding and adopting my preferred gender pronouns when I feel masculine, neither or both.

From her perspective, she admits she feels like she's still in love with a woman who's ""acting out"" a different gender identity. She's admitted that in bed, she's been happy with this because she finds gender play a big turn on.

I've accepted this, I love her completely and we've been together since we first met at university nearly 5 years ago. I don't need her to understand, just accept and support.

When I came out as genderqueer, I came out as a genderfluid woman (I'm normally in a feminine mode, ranging from very feminine to my normal tomboyish phase) but for a variety of reasons, most recently a  sense of disillusionment with feminism and gender politics, I want to identify as fully genderqueer, not as a genderfluid woman.

My worry is am I just moving too fast? In these past months, this has felt nothing but completely right like I've found the language for my thoughts and feelings.

I'm a little scared of fully coming out to my fiancée too. Our relationship is very strong and we're devoting more spare time together over the next year, we both feel we're perfect for each other. Should I ease her into this or is it better to just come out and say it?

She's been accepting but never really understood things like how I could be attracted to a MAAB genderqueer person but not a cisgender man or transman. I think for her, gender = physical sex.

Even though it's easy to say ""Gender is subjective and being ____ doesn't mean you're masculine / being ___ doesn't mean you're feminine,"" it doesn't really seem to make a difference when you're faced with the sort of majority-rule idea of gender roles.  All the women (cis and trans alike)  bonding over things like bobby pins and going to the bathroom in herds and gossip and emotions, and all the men bonding over the equivalent stereotypically masculine stuff (some examples I saw were ""memorizing facts/statistics,"" ""walking awkwardly when they think girls are looking at them,"" and ""presenting solutions when a girlfriend has a problem, not emotional support."") It seems much easier for people to agree on those and relate to each other, and they seem happy with that identification.

I know it's all culturally based, and not biological, but it still makes me uncomfortable. I'm FAAB, and people always say ""Well, you can still be a woman and not be stereotypically feminine blah blah blah"" but then, how do transwomen know they're women / transmen know they're men, if gender is just a social construct? am I just missing the Thing inside my head that says ""I FEEL LIKE A WOMAN/MAN/____""?

Sometimes I think I might be a transman, but then I realize that what I am feeling isn't an identification with the male gender, but a lack of identification with the female gender (which is the one I got born into and so it's been expected of me a lot more).

Longtime lurker here, making my debut in what *seems* to be a genuinely-welcoming, supportive safe space. (Still sorta recovering from my first run-ins with /r/theredpill, /r/beatingwomen, and the other assorted hellholes pockmarking this site.) I'm a 21-year old FAAB who's been contending with gender confusion since early childhood. As a youngster, I was averse to ""girly"" trappings--most of my favorite toys were gender-neutral, and dresses (and the like) always incited a very *visceral* sort of discomfort. I was a pretty timid/passive little kid, though, so I seldom complained when Mom suited me up in the stuff. As puberty approached, and most of my peers outgrew their ""tomboy"" tendencies, I clung to the vestiges of my childhood, presenting myself neutrally and concerning myself *chiefly* with goofy writing and art (while shoving aside my mounting insecurities and ignoring all that nutty ""burgeoning body"" stuff the school nurses rattled on about). It wasn't until a *few* years ago that I really confronted the matter of my identity head-on. I knew I struggled to think of myself as ""female"" (in any conventional sense)--but why? Was it some sorta weird psychological condition? Was I wrestling with deep-seated suppression? Was I a lesbian? A little online exploration and contact with the LGBTQ community helped to assuage some of my uncertainties; and I came to consider myself genderqueer.

Suffice to say, this lifted a big weight off my back--but plenty of concerns still linger. I seem to be attracted to males, but male *attention* (ogling/lustful glances on the street) makes me very uncomfortable; *too* aware of my physical femininity. (I *assume* those folks are reading me as female, anyway; I strive for androgyny and--eventually--a relationship that functions *outside* the conventional boy-girl dynamic.) I experience some bodily dysphoria, but (ultimately) not enough to merit the expense and risk of surgery. Perhaps *most* troubling is the matter of my ""coming out""--this post marks the first time I've spoken about/divulged my queerness in *any* capacity. Though my parents are generally progressive/forward-thinking, I fear that the concept of ""genderqueer"" would seem utterly-alien, far *too* 21st-century for their baby-boomer brains. In particular, I'm extremely close with my mom, and fear the prospect of jeopardizing our relationship.

So basically I completely severed all ties with my old life when I decided to transition. I haven't had contact with my family for years before that, no friends, and quit all jobs/commitments. I was completely free and ""lay low"" for over a year while I changed.

I reemerged a new person. I got a court ordered name change, got a new ID and new SS card, and began meeting people with my new identity. I couldn't be happier with my new life!

Now I need a job! And my first worry was a background check - will the old name/gender automatically pop up? I'm in a tough industry and it's hard enough to find a job without that added hurdle. So far what I have been doing is leaving blank the ""any former names or aliases"" space, and if it comes down to it, I can privately explain to the HR person what the situation is.

What's more concerning though is job references. I feel like I really should not have to call up employers that I haven't spoken to in years and tell them what I've done - I intentionally quit everything so nobody has to know and I want to keep it that way. I also don't feel it's best to tell every prospective employer what the deal is. They don't need a reason to turn me down or start gossip in such a narrow industry. 

What's terrible is I'm ""photoshopping"" my new name onto written references, and asking friends to fake being professional references. I know it's wrong and it really sucks when I know my past employers LOVED me, but I just can't bear to drag my old life into my new one.

I just want to start fresh. I've tried volunteering and getting ""under the table"" jobs just so SOMEONE who knows me by my new identity can vouch for me, but even that required references.

126,2014-04-27 08:40:27,243dp7,8,13,"I apologize in advance if this is disorganized...I've got a lot of thoughts and I'm just going to do this stream-of-consciousness. 

I'm 23 years old and biologically female. In the past year or so, I've been thinking more about my gender identity, and in the past few weeks I've been thinking about it pretty much constantly. I think I might be genderqueer/genderfluid, but I'm not sure and I'm not sure if I'm ready to identify that way.

Recently, I've been thinking about all the ways I've disliked being female. The earliest memory is when I was maybe 4, and I was in the car with my mother, and I wanted to take my shirt off, and my mother didn't want me to, but relented because we were in the car and nobody would see. But of course as we pulled into our street, a bunch of my neighbors were there, and my mom stopped to chat with other parents. I distinctly remember another girl peering into the car, frowning. I don't know if she was frowning because I had my shirt off, or for some other reason, but her frown stuck with me. Afterwards, my mother told me that I had to keep a shirt on because other people had seen me.

I didn't have a lot of trouble with gender roles growing up, mainly because my mom is a 1960s/1970s feminist, and whenever people said that girls couldn't do something, she called it ""old-fashioned thinking.""

When I got older, I had more reasons to be jealous of boys. The ability to pee standing up was one of them, but relatively minor. When I was 11, I was diagnosed with trichotillomania, which is a compulsive hair-pulling disorder. I envied the fact that boys could shave their heads. I currently have managed to grow out the hair at the back of my head, and I've decided I like it long in the back and short in front, except that whenever I get stressed and pull my hair out it gets patchy and I don't like that. But I feel the short in front long in back style kind of fits my identity.

Around the time guys my age started hitting their growth spurts, I got jealous of their height. I remember in particular, one of my friends had been taller than I was until I hit my growth spurt, and when I hit my growth spurt and was finally taller than he was, I was really proud, until of course he hit his growth spurt and was once again taller than I was and I got jealous. Oh, and I also remember in kindergarten, not being allowed to have a sleepover with this same friend because ""boys and girls have different body parts.""

When I learned to like football, I was jealous that boys could play it and I couldn't, and in general I'm jealous of the muscles that men can develop. I work out a fair amount, but I can't reach the muscle size of guys that also work out. My boyfriend is a runner, and doesn't do much arm work, and my biceps are larger than his. I am very proud of this fact. He also does some ab work, and is naturally really skinny, and recently mentioned that he thought he was starting to get a six-pack. And my reaction was jealousy.

I find a lot of gay men attractive, and have on a couple occasions, had crushes on guys I didn't know were gay. I'm only attracted to men though, but including non-binary genders I'd say they have to be biologically male, but not identify as female. I recently discovered the term androphilic and am very happy about having discovered this term. I'm also scared about how my boyfriend might react if I started identifying as other than a cisgender female. We've been dating for 3 1/2 years, so I'm pretty invested in this relationship.

A fairly new issue I'm having is with clothing. I never really had problems with wearing feminine clothing before, but recently I've been having days where I absolutely do not want to wear skirts, dresses, or anything form-fitting. But other days I enjoy wearing feminine clothes. One of the days that I didn't feel like wearing dresses, I had a presentation that required I dress up, and my nice pants were dirty, so I had to wear a dress and by the end of the day, I was very cranky. But then I finally got to go home and change, and I felt so much better. I think this may have been triggered by my discovery of the wonderful thing that is the ""bro tank,"" which shows off my biceps, but doesn't make me look super-feminine. I need more of those.

One thing I'm happy about with being biologically female is the ability to get pregnant and give birth. Also I like to paint my nails. I can't think of a whole lot of other things, though. 

I'm kind of confused/questioning as to how I actually identify, though. Maybe I'm just a woman who doesn't like traditional gender roles. But maybe there's something more, like some days I'm feminine and some days I'm androgynous. I wouldn't say there are ever times where I would fully identify as male, though. Sometimes I feel as if I'm feminine too often to identify as genderqueer, or I'm not genderqueer enough, if that makes any sense. But I've been spending a lot of time thinking about it, so maybe that in itself is an indicator that I might be genderqueer.

So this is a question somehow. I want more information than I've been able to find on my own. Also, I just wanted to talk to somebody about it, but I don't feel comfortable talking with most people I know until I'm a little more sure about my identity. Maybe all I really needed was to write this and get it off my chest and I'll feel fine about everything tomorrow. That would be nice.

I work out a fair amount, but I can\'t reach the muscle size of guys that also work out. My boyfriend is a runner, and doesn\'t do much arm work, and my biceps are larger than his. I am very proud of this fact. He also does some ab work, and is naturally really skinny, and recently mentioned that he thought he was starting to get a six-pack. And my reaction was jealousy.\n\nI find a lot of gay men attractive, and have on a couple occasions, had crushes on guys I didn\'t know were gay. I\'m only attracted to men though, but including non-binary genders I\'d say they have to be biologically male, but not identify as female. I recently discovered the term androphilic and am very happy about having discovered this term. I\'m also scared about how my boyfriend might react if I started identifying as other than a cisgender female. We\'ve been dating for 3 1/2 years, so I\'m pretty invested in this relationship.\n\nA fairly new issue I\'m having is with clothing. I never really had problems with wearing feminine clothing before, but recently I\'ve been having days where I absolutely do not want to wear skirts, dresses, or anything form-fitting. But other days I enjoy wearing feminine clothes. One of the days that I didn\'t feel like wearing dresses, I had a presentation that required I dress up, and my nice pants were dirty, so I had to wear a dress and by the end of the day, I was very cranky. But then I finally got to go home and change, and I felt so much better. I think this may have been triggered by my discovery of the wonderful thing that is the ""bro tank,"" which shows off my biceps, but doesn\'t make me look super-feminine. I need more of those.\n\nOne thing I\'m happy about with being biologically female is the ability to get pregnant and give birth. Also I like to paint my nails. I can\'t think of a whole lot of other things, though. \n\nI\'m kind of confused/questioning as to how I actually identify, though. Maybe I\'m just a woman who doesn\'t like traditional gender roles. But maybe there\'s something more, like some days I\'m feminine and some days I\'m androgynous. I wouldn\'t say there are ever times where I would fully identify as male, though. Sometimes I feel as if I\'m feminine too often to identify as genderqueer, or I\'m not genderqueer enough, if that makes any sense. But I\'ve been spending a lot of time thinking about it, so maybe that in itself is an indicator that I might be genderqueer.\n\nSo this is a question somehow. I want more information than I\'ve been able to find on my own. Also, I just wanted to talk to somebody about it, but I don\'t feel comfortable talking with most people I know until I\'m a little more sure about my identity. Maybe all I really needed was to write this and get it off my chest and I\'ll feel fine about everything tomorrow. That would be nice.\n\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Questioning my gender identity', 'created': 1398613227.0}",98.0

I was at my local equivalent of the Department of Motor Vehicles, getting a license renewed, and the guy processing my paperwork tells me the computer has me listed as female, which he said was odd because I'm clearly male.

I'm still confused by it all, but I think I feel hurt that the DMV guy said there was no doubt at all that I'm male, and that I ""looked nothing like those people who could go either way"". I guess I look so male that he also assumed I'm a closed-minded bigot like he was.
