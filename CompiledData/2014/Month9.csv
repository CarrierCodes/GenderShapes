Everyone loves to believe in the idea that they are always available to you. Well, I can tell you that in terms of finding a doctor in Greece I have exhausted my options. There's always inhousepharmacy right? 

""Hello Paige

Two things:


Echeck is only for US customers resident in the US - the US based cheque verifiers will call to verify the order with the account holder. If you are not in the US to take their call,  Echeck will not accept the order.


We do not ship to Greece.""

Well I guess I could order to my private mailbox back in the US, and pay with echeck... sinc eI only have a mastercard except... they call to verify. I could even arrange to answer said call, and arrange to have my mom mail them to me here in Greece but it's just not practical; it's my only option.

It's too late now, I'm already miserable and pissed off and the most logical thing for me to do at this point is ride it out. I've gone from having a shot every week to nothing and I'm about a month or so into withdrawl. 

I can't help but think I never should have started in the first place. Sure I guess if you're going to always live in a place that has them then who cares? I really want to believe that even in a place with good resources, that things can always change for the worst. It sucks to go through this, so bad.

I sent around 0.22BTC to a place called ""Kiwi Drug"" and I've been ignored ever since I sent the payment, go figure. 

Asides from being very costly, and a restrictive life choice that confines you to a place (which may not be a great place but has the support you need) there's always ""what are the long term effects, quality of the medications that you're obtaining, etc.""

Once a doctor told me that blood level work was nearly entirely subjective with the exception of liver function; I don't trust doctors not to nickel and dime me for all they can so if anybody wants to cross link to clear this up that would be nice. There's a lot to know, and nobody wants to spend money that they don't need to spend. I still don't understand this, and I can't really justify paying for hormones anymore if I need bloodwork that I don't understand otherwise I'd be a hypocrite.

Also another thing that bothers me is that it can't just be as simple as ""this is what I want"" rather I am regarded as mentally ill. With the way it seems to have become common place to criminalize the mentally ill, maybe not worth it?


What I mean by that is... what if I could be whoever I wanted to be and be happy with myself... hormones are definitely nice they make me look better but I guess before I started them I wasn't able to appreciate what it means to know that you are who you are, inside and to be at peace with that...

I'm a male androgyne. My mannerisms aren't overtly fem but pretty apparent. 

I find that many males open up around me. Many are straight, some are flexiable/pan/bi/etc.

Their fem mannerisms come out, even their voices become more fem. They feel comfortable talking fashion and style and other pursuits generally considered fem/female, they talk about how they want their hair to be beautiful and pretty. They'll put on ""chick"" flicks, romance and the like, they'll play female artist and pop songs.

It's a bit sad because if others are around they deepen their voices, they harden up. No more talk about anything that may be considered remotely fem. Unless it's about sex that is.

After some encouraging gender presentation experimentation earlier in the summer, I'm having trouble building momentum to get where I want (femme side of androgyny). I feel stuck between presentations, at the unhappy middle between them. For example, I'm growing out my hair, but right now it's an unflattering boy mophead look. I pierced my ears and have some fairly femme earrings in, but I've been delaying getting more earrings to properly match different outfits etc, and so it feels (to me) more careless than tasteful.

Part of my trouble straying from my MAAB masculine boyness (not that it's that strong ha) is that I've also been feeling way more introverted, reserved, and comfortable in my own space. I feel like femininity (sometimes) involves outward shows of like flamboyance and flair, and this clashes with my impulse to ignore or deemphasize how I look and focus inwards. This has been a problem of mine for years and years and definitely comes from religious family values and the like. 

I feel like in a few months, when my hair is longer, I have a little more money for clothes, and I can play more with femme presentation through layering (I really like winter-mode with scarves and sweaters and such!) I'll be in a way better position. But every day I look in the mirror and am really disappointed in this unhappy medium -- part of me wants to go with a really short cut, get fitted masculine clothes, and call the whole thing off, yknow?

Have any of you been dealing with this feeling recently? Any ideas for how to stay focused and motivated, to keep finding joy, or thoughts about what might be driving this discomfort?

I really want to grow my hair for two reasons:

1) I want it a more gender neutral length because at the moment it's really short and masculine and I don't like it at all. 

2) Both my dad and now my brother have a small bald patch on the back of their head and I really don't want that to happen to me as it's just too masculine an you piss me off soooo much! 

However there's a problem: my mum. It's really hard talking to her about things like gender neutrality particular as every other thing she says is a paranoid ""do you want a sex change?""  Anyway did once manage to bring up the topic I growing my hair and she just instantly invalidates the idea by saying I ""have the wrong type of hair"".

43,2014-09-11 23:06:50,2g5eqz,4,9,"Hi guys, just wondering if anyone could help me with a (minor) gender identity issue I'm having.

I've been wondering recently if I might be genderqueer (or more specifically, bi-gendered). I've read over some of the old posts on here about being bi-gendered, but I don't seem to have the switch over periods that some people have – I always feel the same regardless of what I'm doing. Until now I've been living comfortably as a guy, but I don't really think I've made a huge deal out of it – its just been something like my hair colour or shoe size, something I've accepted without thinking too much about it.

I crossdressed a bit when I was a teenager, but have only started doing it seriously quite recently. I went through a long phase (last four or five years) without wanting to do it at all, and now when I do it it seems to be for different reasons. Then it was more like a fetish, whereas now when I'm dressed I don't feel shock or shame or arousal or euphoria – it's just really nice. I've got into the habit of playing my electric guitar for a couple of hours when I'm in girl mode and it doesn't feel any different to when I'm dressed in what I usually wear (admittedly my skinny jeans fit both roles beautifully). When I look in the mirror, though my face looks more feminine, I still identify strongly with it; it is still me – just another presentation.

I should also say I'm perfectly happy to keep presenting as male – there's no dysphoria or anything like that. I just feel that I could be equally happy presenting as female, putting aside for one moment the stigma and the effort involved changing the persona my friends/aquiantences have me down as. If for whatever reason I woke up tomorrow as a girl then I don't think I'd be too fussed (confused perhaps, but fussed, no).

Anyway, to cut the rambling short I was just wondering if there were any professed bi-gendered people who feel anything at all similar. Obviously if anyone else wants to weigh in that would be great too; I'm very new to this, and am very much still exploring – it's kinda like I've been living happily enough in the same house for twenty-two years only to discover there's all these extra rooms that I never knew about.

When I look in the mirror, though my face looks more feminine, I still identify strongly with it; it is still me – just another presentation.\n\nI should also say I'm perfectly happy to keep presenting as male – there's no dysphoria or anything like that. I just feel that I could be equally happy presenting as female, putting aside for one moment the stigma and the effort involved changing the persona my friends/aquiantences have me down as. If for whatever reason I woke up tomorrow as a girl then I don't think I'd be too fussed (confused perhaps, but fussed, no).\n\nAnyway, to cut the rambling short I was just wondering if there were any professed bi-gendered people who feel anything at all similar. Obviously if anyone else wants to weigh in that would be great too; I'm very new to this, and am very much still exploring – it's kinda like I've been living happily enough in the same house for twenty-two years only to discover there's all these extra rooms that I never knew about.\n\nThanks for reading :)"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Think I may be bi-gendered', 'created': 1410502010.0}",

I was born biologically female. My entire life, I've been a ""tomboy"" but I always knew that that wasn't ""like"" other girls - even the other tomboys. I wore all boys clothes and BEGGED my mom for short hair. When she finally agreed, I felt fabulous, but I was picked on in school. Whenever we played pretend when I was a kid, I always played a male character. But, it wasn't like I viewed myself as a boy. I just never really considered myself a girl. 

I attended a private Baptist school from 2nd to 10th grade. All girls had to wear skirts or dresses every day. I hated it and felt physically uncomfortable in female dress clothes. I can't wear heals. I can't ""pull off"" a graceful walk in a dress or a skirt. Give me jeans and a t shirt and men's shoes all the way. 

As puberty hit, I remember being incredibly disappointed that I developed breasts because I knew I would no longer be ""mistaken"" for ""one of the boys"" when I was out with friends. 

I spent my entire youth and most of my adolescence incredibly confused about what I ""was"". The Baptist school obviously was not teaching proper sex-ed. I didn't even know bi sexual was a ""thing."" I finally found out it was in 11th grade, and everything just clicked. I realized I wasn't a freak for liking girls and boys the same. The gender identity thing still eluded me for some years after that. 

Recently, I discovered that gender, like sexuality, is not a binary. I feel much relief at this discovery. Here's my hang up, though:

I am now happily married to a man whom I love completely. We have a beautiful daughter. Too often, I hear from friends that I'm ""not really queer"" because I am in a hetero-normal relationship. My husband is decidedly straight, and, since I've only recently discovered the fact that gender queer/ gender non-binary is a real ""thing"" and I'm not just some weirdo, I've never really discussed this aspect of my identity with him. I know I feel very strange when I'm addressed by ""she"" or ""woman"", but when he calls me wife or my daughter calls me ""mama"", it doesn't bother me nearly as much. I understand that this is a spectrum and all... But I'm wondering 2 main things:
1) Is it even wise to come out to my husband and family and friends? (when I finally told my conservative Christian mother I identified as Bisexual, her response was ""well, I'm just glad you made the right choice and married a man."" -  she totally missed the fact that I love his personality and spirit, not his gender or reproductive organs and that I just as well could have settled down with a woman if I had felt that connection to her.) 

And, 2) if I do decide to have this conversation with my husband, what is the best way to do so without threatening his sexuality and identity as a cis male who is decidedly straight? 

Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 

-S


UPDATE: so.... It didn't go as well as I would have hoped. I began to delicately breach the topic of my clothing and hair style choices and I phrased it saying things like, ""this is how I feel most comfortable expressing myself."" I reaffirmed the fact that I love him fully, but that I am not exactly ""straight"" (he knew this going into the relationship - at least that I identify as bisexual and that he's the only man I've ever really felt ""in love"" with.) I started to segue into my ""fashion choices"" and said, ""I know that the fact that I have a shaved head and dress in men's clothing bothers a lot of people in my family, and I don't want you to be one of them. I want to talk openly about this."" He cut me off, presumably assuming that the conversation was heading in a different direction and said, ""I've dated girls before who have turned out to be androgynous - that's not you. I don't care how you dress, you don't look like a man. I wouldn't be with you if you looked like a man. You're beautiful no matter how you dress. Dont feel bad about it. I know you're a woman, and I think you are beautiful. Don't worry about me."" However, the nature of his comments discouraged me from discussing it further. ""I would never be with a man or a woman who looks like a man"" made me feel strongly that coming our as gender queer and expressing my desire to bind and present in a more masculine way would, in fact, cause him to leave the relationship.

To put it simply, I'm writing a novel. I'd prefer not to divulge all the details of the plot or concept, but what I will say is that it is set in the far future, in a utopian world where all societies are quite advanced technologically and socially. That said, almost all people are openly gay, bisexual, lesbian, pansexual, and the like, and one can change his or her sex very easily. Sex and gender identity are both non-issues.

In this universe, such things are no longer ""morally loose"", but instead, ""morally reasonable"". I know, it sounds extremely controversial, but it's among one of the many things I am seeking to address in the book. Think of it as an experiment to see how plausible such a convenient future would be.

So, what I'm here to ask is: What does ""non-binary"" mean? I know it's much broader than simply ""LGBT"", so what's the spectrum, exactly? Is there even a spectrum, or is it much more complex or in-depth? What does it mean to be ""non-binary"", and what were your experiences as one?

You can, if you're comfortable with it, share whatever oppression you experienced, or whatever feelings you felt when you discovered your sexuality, and as you grew accustomed to it. I want to know how you learned to love yourself and know yourself, or how you're having trouble getting there. I'll also be happy to hear what you think about it, how you feel about it, and the like.

I'd like to finish this up with a quote, something my friend said earlier that inspired me to dig a little deeper, and shed more light on the topic when it comes to my writing:

So I'm a boy (apparently) I just feel so weird with my body. It's not wrong as such, just I don't feel it's me. But I don't feel a girls body would be me either, it's like my body is just a shell which I'm in and it seems so weird because it's not truly mine. 
But it just makes me uncomfortable when around people because they view me as this shell, as a boy, and not the real me. Idk why but it particularly antagonises me how girls view me and a boy because obviously I'm different. I wonder what they think of my body (/shell) like the obvious difference being my penis and flat chest and stuff. I feel kinda weird even more when around them :/. Is this weird?  How can I stop feeling this way?  Apparently I'm not allowed to come out and that'll just be stupid anyway. :/

Ad then I feel guilty in my body because it's a boys and I feel bad that girls face oppression and sexism and apparently things like periods hurt and boobs are annoying, I feel kinda bad that I don't have that and I have it easy and I feel strange that I have penis and that people view my shell as a boy.

To start off I am genderfluid and use the pronoun: they, them, their. I have always had penis envy but as I have grown up and really looked and thought about myself I realize that envy is not the case. I need a penis.

However I do want to stay looking androgynous, I know if I get facial or chest hair I will just get laser removal. I have contacted a therapist and waiting to hear back on acceptance. 

Now I am not sure what the next step is. I already dress in the way to make myself happy and feel myself, but I am unsure of hormones. My family has a history of weak pelvic floor so I am unsure of having a hystoricamy(sp?).

I have a support group I attend but was unable to attend the last time and I feel the need for a meeting and so here I am.

Get the breast growth and possibly hip growth before its too late,

Wait for a few more years (probably cause me more anguish) to get a solid beard, then go on estrogen?

So, where to begin? On several occasions have I thought about posting somewhere, something like this, but I've always backed away from it. One would think the anonymity of the internet would make it the first place to go to for support, but apparently my brain works in weird ways (something I've had plenty of time to try and get used to). I honestly never expected to reach a point where I would discuss this with anyone - internet stranger, close friend or whoever - literally, anyone. But here I am now typing this out, so let's start by doing a quick overview.

Important stuff first - I'm 27 and AMAB, and until relatively recently presenting 100% as such. I never really had any gender issues as a child, but things have been considerably more complex over the last ten years or so. The main difficulty has been working out who I am. Straight cis with a kink? MTF? I've thought about it enough to discount both of those, but in some ways that has only made things trickier.

Anyway, the thing that has kicked everything off was when I got 100% confirmation that I could come out to one of my closest friends. Long story short, after a conversation we had one evening, I then knew she that is completely supportive of trans people (and indeed LGBT as a whole). I didn't plan anything at that point to come out to her, but I've realised there was at least a part of my mind that thought of it as a distinct possibility. Anyway, one evening roughly 9-12 months ago, during a conversation about sex/relationships I managed to summon the courage to tell her that I feel my gender is probably somewhere between male and female. And as expected, it was literally no deal at all. It gave us the ability to have the odd little in-joke here and there, but there was no further discussion about it and all was good. 

Anyway, fast-forward to June, and our social group was all at this quite wonderful party, and all we all got rather splendidly trashed. And me and this friend of mine ended up chatting drunkenly, and somehow (I literally have no idea how) we ended up talking about my gender again. But all that really came from it was reinforcement of her unwavering support. Until this point, I had considered myself in relative control of my feelings, but a couple of weeks later, something happened that completely threw me and my grip was considerably loosened. 

So I took up my friend's offer of an ear if ever I needed it, and basically came out to her with everything. That in itself felt unbelievably weird, given that I had years of believing that noone was ever going to know about this, but also there was a big wave of relief that washed over me. The next few weeks presented a bit of a challenge, as my mind went on a roller coaster as it processed all the new ideas that came from a second perspective. 

The first notable point is that I came out to this friend's partner, who is my oldest and closest friend. I did feel less comfortable discussing things with him, so I kept it to the basics, but he was just as unfazed as she was. That was such a relief, as although I wouldn't have done it if I didn't know it was 'safe' to do so, it was still unbelievably nerve-racking. The second notable point was when I reached a point when, with all the options put before me, including many I had written off myself, I reached a point of real doubt as to where I was going to take this. Pandora's box was how I had began to think about it (although I had forgotten when I first made the comparison about what the last thing out of the box was, which was surprisingly comforting when I was reminded), and there was just too much on my mind for me to just go back to how I was before; living with it there in the back of my mind, but not affecting day-to-day life. However, I was able to get a load of my mind after talking with my friend again, and a renewed perspective has finally enable to me to be at peace once more. While those six weeks or so were some of the toughest I've ever had to get through, certainly from an emotional point of view, the place where I'm at at the other end is somewhere where I feel I can finally see a path that might lead me to where I want to be.

That's all lead me to here. One of the things I've realised I was doing before, was not facing up to the fact, almost trying to ignore it; do what I needed to to appease it, but then otherwise carry on as if it was something separate from the rest of reality. What that period of introspection has done has finally put me at complete peace with the fact that my gender does not fall within the male/female dichotomy. I still have questions to ask myself, but I've realised they are, at least currently, not the pertinent ones.

The most pertinent question I have had, has always been what do I see my gender as? And I think I finally have the closest thing to an answer I have ever had, and probably will ever get. And that is some form of genderfluid, with the two genders being on separate scales that move independently. I've never truly and completely identified as male, and that I do so to the level I do is surely influenced by this male body I have. If I was AFAB, I would probably have a similar level of attachment to the female gender, but that is purely hypothetical. It's difficult to know exactly how much that I, as AMAB, identify as female, and that I feel is in part due to the fact that I've never experienced being female, and it's overwhelming unlikely I ever really will. But I do have periods (lol, ironic pun) where I feel much more aligned towards female, and it's at those points I do at least a little bit bemoan the fact that I'm not and I have a body that would make passing rather challenging. I haven't quite written that off entirely though, and my friend has offered to help, which I do plan on taking her up on; in fact, with Hallowe'en coming up, it seems like a grand opportunity to explore that avenue. But the vastly more likely thing is just for me to express more of a feminine side while presenting male, which is something I have finally now started to do already. It's only been relatively little things, as I've never liked doing things that draw attention to me, so the simple fact I've found it in me to do what little I've done thus far I at least find encouraging.

There probably is more I could add to flesh out the detail, in fact, I know there is. But I've realised that those details don't really matter, not to the here and now. And reaching that realisation was in some ways as liberating as a lot of the above was.

So, as I've been writing this, I've been thinking to myself, what is the point of it? I've lurked here a bit recently without signing up, and it's the only part of Reddit I've ever actually visited. And now here I am, with a huge wall of text, not really asking any questions, and not really asking for support, per se. Any input is obviously welcome, and I might still come back again for advice at a later date, but what I've realised is that it has been somewhat therapeutic to type it up and have it all there before me. And that, is a good thing.

I don't know where the path before me leads or what forks I may find in it, but at least I have now found it, and I feel somewhat ready to see where it goes. It's not the perfect solution, but it's the best I'm going to get within the boundaries of reality, and I think at long last, I'm okay with that. :)

I grew up in the gay community (my parents are gay) and identify as pansexual myself. I have a question about the relationship between identifying as gender nonconforming and gender stereotypes.

How I understand the presentation of gender nonconformity is mixing things that are stereotypically male or female (eg, a dress with a beard) or presenting as ambiguous by being careful not to lean one stereotypical way or the other. If I am incorrect in my understanding of this (and I realize there is a spectrum and some may do things differently, or some may dress a certain way one day and another the next) please feel free to correct me.

I also understand though, that presentation and identity are very different. Theoretically, then, if there were no gender stereotypes, would this change the way gender non-conforming people identify, in the sense that sometimes they love their boobs (or lack thereof) and other times that doesn't feel right? Am I understanding this correctly? Also, how do you think this might change gender non-conforming presentation?

As a side note, isn't it just fun to play with and mix the stereotypes sometimes? If I could grow a beard I feel like I would have a huge one - and then wear lipstick everyday.

If I am completely missing the mark, please correct me.

I have been acting and dressing slowly but progressively more and more masculine. I feel more and more comfortable and confident as I do so. I dress almost exclusively in mens clothing, have mostly ""typically male"" mannerisms and interests/hobbies. I love passing as a man in everyday life, and I usually do at initial glance. I have a man's hair-cut, I am fairly muscular and broad shouldered, i have a masculine enough face, and my breasts are usually concealed with the shirts I wear. If I were to bind more often, work on deepening my voice, and maybe pack a little something, I am quite sure I could pass entirely.

There problem is the genderbending level I am at now. I mostly look like a guy, but I keep using my given name (which I hate) and using women's restrooms and in general keeping some level of a ""woman"" identity to the public eye, though I don't know how much of a woman I really am.

I suppose part of my question is how much one really needs to live in the gender binary. If I want to subscribe to the binary, I certainly want to be a man. I have wondered if I want to take T, and have not yet reached a decision because if I do so, I also want to change my name and try to get the government to recognize me as a man.

My daily crossdressing is causing issues, and I sort of want to fit into the gender binary a little bit again.

119,2014-09-30 10:46:42,2hvmx5,1,3,"I need some help, I'm very confused and wondering about the possibility that I might be trans* and the eventuality of some transition. 

**Background :** 

I am FAAB and 26 years old. I don't fit the trans narrative of ""always feeling in the wrong body"". I am bisexual, and have memories of ""wishing to be a boy"" when I was a kid, but it was so I could like girls. Also, I have known for long that ""if I was a man, I'd like to go by {androgynous-name}"". For a few years in high-school, I was over-girly but I might have been over-compensating a bit.

Due to having a crappy mother, I have reasons to have strong aversion to my secondary sexual characteristics. For a very long time, I have wished I didn't have breast, and to be sterile.

**What's going on:**

About one or two years ago, people around me seeming accepting of whomever I was, and some sexual experimenting with strap-ons, as well as learning a bit about trans* issues triggered some questioning and dysphoria. It kind of began when a lover told me he though of us as a gay couple, which kind of dragged my out of the closet. 

I realised I really, really prefer people assuming I'm a man. I also learnt that I can't masturbate without thinking I have a cock (Previously I never masturbated).

I am in the process of presenting more manly, which is great but makes me dysphoric because it points out how much my body doesn't fit as a male one.  I am short and very thin, with very big boobs. I still occasionally present as femme, which feels great (when rare) because I get so much social validation.

I talked about it with a few friends, a bit with lovers, and a lot with my partner. We talked about hysterectomy (which I always wanted, having a fertile uterus is a nightmare for me), and about top surgery. I'm afraid of modifying my body, but I can't get my mind off it.

**So here's the deal :**

- I do have genital and secondary sexual characteristics dysphoria, but it could be because of my own body-issues due to having a hateful mother.

- I find it very empowering to present more manly, but it's not really doable with this body, and it could be just because of patriarchy.

- I feel very good with people using neutral or male pronouns, but I'm not that hurt by people using female pronouns most times.

- In my sexuality with women, I'm much happier thinking of myself as a man, but it could be because I did a very late coming out and kind of constructed a ""hetero"" attraction to women.

- I don't feel any need to be considered as a man in my family : if I asked my brother or my father to use male pronouns with me, I'd surely be introducing much more gender in our relationship than there currently is. They know me well enough that they never assume anything about me due to me being a ""woman"". I feel like this has no importance whatsoever in our relationship.

So I have no idea if I could be trans*, if I'd be happier with a transition, if I could do some kind of half-transition to the middle and still administratively be a woman while presenting very androgyn, or even if this is real and not something I'm imagining.

I feel like I might be genderqueer, but not really willing to come out or explicitly tell people, ..it's just an internal thing. But I'm a little worried that it might be ""inauthentic"" because:

A.) I've had some feelings for a long time (since childhood, honestly). but they only became ""bad"" enough to become a concern after I ended a long-term, abusive relationship in which i was sexually abused (and in which I had to behave as a completely feminine, submissive women to appease my partner).

B.) I'm turning 25 in a few months and I feel weird because it seems weird to spend so much of my life ok with womenhood--not only that, but as a femme woman.  

C.) I've been diagnosed with either BPD or BPD tendencies (depending on the doc). I've also been recently diagnosed with ADHD. I've actually got my shit mostly together (working, in school, psychs are pleased with my progress), but I can't deny I have some identity and impulsivity issues.

Anyway.


Is this real? Is it OK to explore this even if I have self-doubts? Even if I did explore it, I don't even know how to integrate it into my life (my industry isn't queerphobic but it is a bit conservative). I don't know if I gave enough details...I don't know if I want to?

After some encouraging gender presentation experimentation earlier in the summer, I'm having trouble building momentum to get where I want (femme side of androgyny). I feel stuck between presentations, at the unhappy middle between them. For example, I'm growing out my hair, but right now it's an unflattering boy mophead look. I pierced my ears and have some fairly femme earrings in, but I've been delaying getting more earrings to properly match different outfits etc, and so it feels (to me) more careless than tasteful.

Part of my trouble straying from my MAAB masculine boyness (not that it's that strong ha) is that I've also been feeling way more introverted, reserved, and comfortable in my own space. I feel like femininity (sometimes) involves outward shows of like flamboyance and flair, and this clashes with my impulse to ignore or deemphasize how I look and focus inwards. This has been a problem of mine for years and years and definitely comes from religious family values and the like. 

I feel like in a few months, when my hair is longer, I have a little more money for clothes, and I can play more with femme presentation through layering (I really like winter-mode with scarves and sweaters and such!) I'll be in a way better position. But every day I look in the mirror and am really disappointed in this unhappy medium -- part of me wants to go with a really short cut, get fitted masculine clothes, and call the whole thing off, yknow?

Have any of you been dealing with this feeling recently? Any ideas for how to stay focused and motivated, to keep finding joy, or thoughts about what might be driving this discomfort? Part of me is thinking ""well, if I feel uncomfortable, maybe I will feel the most comfortable gender conforming entirely"", but that thought just makes me sad. I don't know, any thoughts?

40,2014-09-09 13:25:34,2fwkxd,5,6,"Hi

I really want to grow my hair for two reasons:

1) I want it a more gender neutral length because at the moment it's really short and masculine and I don't like it at all. 

2) Both my dad and now my brother have a small bald patch on the back of their head and I really don't want that to happen to me as it's just too masculine an you piss me off soooo much! 

However there's a problem: my mum. It's really hard talking to her about things like gender neutrality particular as every other thing she says is a paranoid ""do you want a sex change?""  Anyway did once manage to bring up the topic I growing my hair and she just instantly invalidates the idea by saying I ""have the wrong type of hair"". This really pissed me off as I now don't have her support when I do eventually try to grow my hair. 

I want a style like [this](http://i.imgur.com/DadQNNI.jpg) ideally but would be willing to compromise to [this](http://i.imgur.com/0V99Q7G.jpg) or [this.](http://i.imgur.com/0Rjc6kj.jpg) I just want to know if it's possible and if my mum is talking bullshit or if I really do have ""the wrong type of hair"" which apparently tends to ""grow thick and bushy and not down"".

51,2014-09-11 23:06:50,2g5eqz,4,9,"Hi guys, just wondering if anyone could help me with a (minor) gender identity issue I'm having.

I've been wondering recently if I might be genderqueer (or more specifically, bi-gendered). I've read over some of the old posts on here about being bi-gendered, but I don't seem to have the switch over periods that some people have – I always feel the same regardless of what I'm doing. Until now I've been living comfortably as a guy, but I don't really think I've made a huge deal out of it – its just been something like my hair colour or shoe size, something I've accepted without thinking too much about it.

I crossdressed a bit when I was a teenager, but have only started doing it seriously quite recently. I went through a long phase (last four or five years) without wanting to do it at all, and now when I do it it seems to be for different reasons. Then it was more like a fetish, whereas now when I'm dressed I don't feel shock or shame or arousal or euphoria – it's just really nice. I've got into the habit of playing my electric guitar for a couple of hours when I'm in girl mode and it doesn't feel any different to when I'm dressed in what I usually wear (admittedly my skinny jeans fit both roles beautifully). When I look in the mirror, though my face looks more feminine, I still identify strongly with it; it is still me – just another presentation.

I should also say I'm perfectly happy to keep presenting as male – there's no dysphoria or anything like that. I just feel that I could be equally happy presenting as female, putting aside for one moment the stigma and the effort involved changing the persona my friends/aquiantences have me down as. If for whatever reason I woke up tomorrow as a girl then I don't think I'd be too fussed (confused perhaps, but fussed, no).

Anyway, to cut the rambling short I was just wondering if there were any professed bi-gendered people who feel anything at all similar. Obviously if anyone else wants to weigh in that would be great too; I'm very new to this, and am very much still exploring – it's kinda like I've been living happily enough in the same house for twenty-two years only to discover there's all these extra rooms that I never knew about.

""Hello Paige

Two things:


Echeck is only for US customers resident in the US - the US based cheque verifiers will call to verify the order with the account holder. If you are not in the US to take their call,  Echeck will not accept the order.


We do not ship to Greece.""

Well I guess I could order to my private mailbox back in the US, and pay with echeck... sinc eI only have a mastercard except... they call to verify. I could even arrange to answer said call, and arrange to have my mom mail them to me here in Greece but it's just not practical; it's my only option.

It's too late now, I'm already miserable and pissed off and the most logical thing for me to do at this point is ride it out. I've gone from having a shot every week to nothing and I'm about a month or so into withdrawl. 

I can't help but think I never should have started in the first place. Sure I guess if you're going to always live in a place that has them then who cares? I really want to believe that even in a place with good resources, that things can always change for the worst. It sucks to go through this, so bad.

I sent around 0.22BTC to a place called ""Kiwi Drug"" and I've been ignored ever since I sent the payment, go figure. 

Asides from being very costly, and a restrictive life choice that confines you to a place (which may not be a great place but has the support you need) there's always ""what are the long term effects, quality of the medications that you're obtaining, etc.""

Once a doctor told me that blood level work was nearly entirely subjective with the exception of liver function; I don't trust doctors not to nickel and dime me for all they can so if anybody wants to cross link to clear this up that would be nice. There's a lot to know, and nobody wants to spend money that they don't need to spend. I still don't understand this, and I can't really justify paying for hormones anymore if I need bloodwork that I don't understand otherwise I'd be a hypocrite.

Also another thing that bothers me is that it can't just be as simple as ""this is what I want"" rather I am regarded as mentally ill. With the way it seems to have become common place to criminalize the mentally ill, maybe not worth it?


What I mean by that is... what if I could be whoever I wanted to be and be happy with myself... hormones are definitely nice they make me look better but I guess before I started them I wasn't able to appreciate what it means to know that you are who you are, inside and to be at peace with that...

63,2014-09-14 23:53:33,2geu7x,14,11,"Hey all, I'm a 26 year old gender queer person who is also a bisexual. I wanted to share my story and get your opinion. 

I was born biologically female. My entire life, I've been a ""tomboy"" but I always knew that that wasn't ""like"" other girls - even the other tomboys. I wore all boys clothes and BEGGED my mom for short hair. When she finally agreed, I felt fabulous, but I was picked on in school. Whenever we played pretend when I was a kid, I always played a male character. But, it wasn't like I viewed myself as a boy. I just never really considered myself a girl. 

I attended a private Baptist school from 2nd to 10th grade. All girls had to wear skirts or dresses every day. I hated it and felt physically uncomfortable in female dress clothes. I can't wear heals. I can't ""pull off"" a graceful walk in a dress or a skirt. Give me jeans and a t shirt and men's shoes all the way. 

As puberty hit, I remember being incredibly disappointed that I developed breasts because I knew I would no longer be ""mistaken"" for ""one of the boys"" when I was out with friends. 

I spent my entire youth and most of my adolescence incredibly confused about what I ""was"". The Baptist school obviously was not teaching proper sex-ed. I didn't even know bi sexual was a ""thing."" I finally found out it was in 11th grade, and everything just clicked. I realized I wasn't a freak for liking girls and boys the same. The gender identity thing still eluded me for some years after that. 

Recently, I discovered that gender, like sexuality, is not a binary. I feel much relief at this discovery. Here's my hang up, though:

I am now happily married to a man whom I love completely. We have a beautiful daughter. Too often, I hear from friends that I'm ""not really queer"" because I am in a hetero-normal relationship. My husband is decidedly straight, and, since I've only recently discovered the fact that gender queer/ gender non-binary is a real ""thing"" and I'm not just some weirdo, I've never really discussed this aspect of my identity with him. I know I feel very strange when I'm addressed by ""she"" or ""woman"", but when he calls me wife or my daughter calls me ""mama"", it doesn't bother me nearly as much. I understand that this is a spectrum and all... But I'm wondering 2 main things:
1) Is it even wise to come out to my husband and family and friends? (when I finally told my conservative Christian mother I identified as Bisexual, her response was ""well, I'm just glad you made the right choice and married a man."" -  she totally missed the fact that I love his personality and spirit, not his gender or reproductive organs and that I just as well could have settled down with a woman if I had felt that connection to her.) 

And, 2) if I do decide to have this conversation with my husband, what is the best way to do so without threatening his sexuality and identity as a cis male who is decidedly straight? 

Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. 

-S


UPDATE: so.... It didn't go as well as I would have hoped. I began to delicately breach the topic of my clothing and hair style choices and I phrased it saying things like, ""this is how I feel most comfortable expressing myself."" I reaffirmed the fact that I love him fully, but that I am not exactly ""straight"" (he knew this going into the relationship - at least that I identify as bisexual and that he's the only man I've ever really felt ""in love"" with.) I started to segue into my ""fashion choices"" and said, ""I know that the fact that I have a shaved head and dress in men's clothing bothers a lot of people in my family, and I don't want you to be one of them. I want to talk openly about this."" He cut me off, presumably assuming that the conversation was heading in a different direction and said, ""I've dated girls before who have turned out to be androgynous - that's not you. I don't care how you dress, you don't look like a man. I wouldn't be with you if you looked like a man. You're beautiful no matter how you dress. Dont feel bad about it. I know you're a woman, and I think you are beautiful. Don't worry about me."" However, the nature of his comments discouraged me from discussing it further. ""I would never be with a man or a woman who looks like a man"" made me feel strongly that coming our as gender queer and expressing my desire to bind and present in a more masculine way would, in fact, cause him to leave the relationship.

73,2014-09-16 16:47:52,2gknsv,35,13,"Hi there! I'm very new to Reddit, but a friend of mine pointed this subreddit out to me because I had been asking him/her about his gender identity, and I simply had to register an account and dive right in.

To put it simply, I'm writing a novel. I'd prefer not to divulge all the details of the plot or concept, but what I will say is that it is set in the far future, in a utopian world where all societies are quite advanced technologically and socially. That said, almost all people are openly gay, bisexual, lesbian, pansexual, and the like, and one can change his or her sex very easily. Sex and gender identity are both non-issues.

In this universe, such things are no longer ""morally loose"", but instead, ""morally reasonable"". I know, it sounds extremely controversial, but it's among one of the many things I am seeking to address in the book. Think of it as an experiment to see how plausible such a convenient future would be.

So, what I'm here to ask is: What does ""non-binary"" mean? I know it's much broader than simply ""LGBT"", so what's the spectrum, exactly? Is there even a spectrum, or is it much more complex or in-depth? What does it mean to be ""non-binary"", and what were your experiences as one?

You can, if you're comfortable with it, share whatever oppression you experienced, or whatever feelings you felt when you discovered your sexuality, and as you grew accustomed to it. I want to know how you learned to love yourself and know yourself, or how you're having trouble getting there. I'll also be happy to hear what you think about it, how you feel about it, and the like.

I'd like to finish this up with a quote, something my friend said earlier that inspired me to dig a little deeper, and shed more light on the topic when it comes to my writing:

It's not even the mess itself, it's the strain it puts on my body and mind having to go through this every month. I have PCOS and my periods are just terribad.

My questions:

* Anybody here get a hysto?
* How did your body react? 
* Do you have to take female hormones for the rest of your life?
* Do you have to take male hormones for the rest of your life?
* What happens to your body if you don't take any hormones after a hysto? Someone told me that there's a higher risk of cancers.

- ""If you want to be gay be gay. If I wanted to date a woman I would.""
- ""Don't be a guy that does girly things. I don't like it, it confuses me.""
- ""I don't want you (and it was either working on or being, I was in shock by this point) more feminine.""

This came about last night while discussing a tattoo I want on my wrist, the phrase ""this too shall pass"" in cursive. Apparently wrist tattoos are ""gay"", which apparently is a problem when it applies to me (she otherwise doesn't have a problem with homosexuality etc.)

A list of how that makes one feel:

- Gut-punched
- Confused
- Anxious
- Afraid
- Every other adjective and descriptor for fear and upset.

I'm not out to her yet. I'm just starting now to process stuff that I've felt for a very long time. This really shoots any notion of coming out, or talking to her about whats going on within me anytime soon. Even more, I fear, ever.

 What it'd be like to get called miss, and,
Found in that some sacred bliss,
something in that seemed amiss, but still,
I wentttttt that path

 AND THEY WERE SINGGINNGGG MY, MY,
MISSY LANA YOU'RE FLY,
LOOKING HELLA, LOOK MUCH BETTA,
AND WE ALL KNOW WHY,
FINALLY REFLECTING WHAT FEELS COMFY INSIDE,
YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO HIDE,
YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO... HIDDEEEE

 But apparently I was hiding because I'm androgyne and I totally didn't realize that.
Still getting that #hype420 female body, but damn do I love me some andro presentation and they/them pronouns.

So, where to begin? On several occasions have I thought about posting somewhere, something like this, but I've always backed away from it. One would think the anonymity of the internet would make it the first place to go to for support, but apparently my brain works in weird ways (something I've had plenty of time to try and get used to). I honestly never expected to reach a point where I would discuss this with anyone - internet stranger, close friend or whoever - literally, anyone. But here I am now typing this out, so let's start by doing a quick overview.

Important stuff first - I'm 27 and AMAB, and until relatively recently presenting 100% as such. I never really had any gender issues as a child, but things have been considerably more complex over the last ten years or so. The main difficulty has been working out who I am. Straight cis with a kink? MTF? I've thought about it enough to discount both of those, but in some ways that has only made things trickier.

Anyway, the thing that has kicked everything off was when I got 100% confirmation that I could come out to one of my closest friends. Long story short, after a conversation we had one evening, I then knew she that is completely supportive of trans people (and indeed LGBT as a whole). I didn't plan anything at that point to come out to her, but I've realised there was at least a part of my mind that thought of it as a distinct possibility. Anyway, one evening roughly 9-12 months ago, during a conversation about sex/relationships I managed to summon the courage to tell her that I feel my gender is probably somewhere between male and female. And as expected, it was literally no deal at all. It gave us the ability to have the odd little in-joke here and there, but there was no further discussion about it and all was good. 

Anyway, fast-forward to June, and our social group was all at this quite wonderful party, and all we all got rather splendidly trashed. And me and this friend of mine ended up chatting drunkenly, and somehow (I literally have no idea how) we ended up talking about my gender again. But all that really came from it was reinforcement of her unwavering support. Until this point, I had considered myself in relative control of my feelings, but a couple of weeks later, something happened that completely threw me and my grip was considerably loosened. 

So I took up my friend's offer of an ear if ever I needed it, and basically came out to her with everything. That in itself felt unbelievably weird, given that I had years of believing that noone was ever going to know about this, but also there was a big wave of relief that washed over me. The next few weeks presented a bit of a challenge, as my mind went on a roller coaster as it processed all the new ideas that came from a second perspective. 

The first notable point is that I came out to this friend's partner, who is my oldest and closest friend. I did feel less comfortable discussing things with him, so I kept it to the basics, but he was just as unfazed as she was. That was such a relief, as although I wouldn't have done it if I didn't know it was 'safe' to do so, it was still unbelievably nerve-racking. The second notable point was when I reached a point when, with all the options put before me, including many I had written off myself, I reached a point of real doubt as to where I was going to take this. Pandora's box was how I had began to think about it (although I had forgotten when I first made the comparison about what the last thing out of the box was, which was surprisingly comforting when I was reminded), and there was just too much on my mind for me to just go back to how I was before; living with it there in the back of my mind, but not affecting day-to-day life. However, I was able to get a load of my mind after talking with my friend again, and a renewed perspective has finally enable to me to be at peace once more. While those six weeks or so were some of the toughest I've ever had to get through, certainly from an emotional point of view, the place where I'm at at the other end is somewhere where I feel I can finally see a path that might lead me to where I want to be.

That's all lead me to here. One of the things I've realised I was doing before, was not facing up to the fact, almost trying to ignore it; do what I needed to to appease it, but then otherwise carry on as if it was something separate from the rest of reality. What that period of introspection has done has finally put me at complete peace with the fact that my gender does not fall within the male/female dichotomy. I still have questions to ask myself, but I've realised they are, at least currently, not the pertinent ones.

The most pertinent question I have had, has always been what do I see my gender as? And I think I finally have the closest thing to an answer I have ever had, and probably will ever get. And that is some form of genderfluid, with the two genders being on separate scales that move independently. I've never truly and completely identified as male, and that I do so to the level I do is surely influenced by this male body I have. If I was AFAB, I would probably have a similar level of attachment to the female gender, but that is purely hypothetical. It's difficult to know exactly how much that I, as AMAB, identify as female, and that I feel is in part due to the fact that I've never experienced being female, and it's overwhelming unlikely I ever really will. But I do have periods (lol, ironic pun) where I feel much more aligned towards female, and it's at those points I do at least a little bit bemoan the fact that I'm not and I have a body that would make passing rather challenging. I haven't quite written that off entirely though, and my friend has offered to help, which I do plan on taking her up on; in fact, with Hallowe'en coming up, it seems like a grand opportunity to explore that avenue. But the vastly more likely thing is just for me to express more of a feminine side while presenting male, which is something I have finally now started to do already. It's only been relatively little things, as I've never liked doing things that draw attention to me, so the simple fact I've found it in me to do what little I've done thus far I at least find encouraging.

There probably is more I could add to flesh out the detail, in fact, I know there is. But I've realised that those details don't really matter, not to the here and now. And reaching that realisation was in some ways as liberating as a lot of the above was.

So, as I've been writing this, I've been thinking to myself, what is the point of it? I've lurked here a bit recently without signing up, and it's the only part of Reddit I've ever actually visited. And now here I am, with a huge wall of text, not really asking any questions, and not really asking for support, per se. Any input is obviously welcome, and I might still come back again for advice at a later date, but what I've realised is that it has been somewhat therapeutic to type it up and have it all there before me. And that, is a good thing.

I don't know where the path before me leads or what forks I may find in it, but at least I have now found it, and I feel somewhat ready to see where it goes. It's not the perfect solution, but it's the best I'm going to get within the boundaries of reality, and I think at long last, I'm okay with that. :)

141,2014-09-29 03:05:31,2hr7fu,1,2,"Hello everybody,

I grew up in the gay community (my parents are gay) and identify as pansexual myself. I have a question about the relationship between identifying as gender nonconforming and gender stereotypes.

How I understand the presentation of gender nonconformity is mixing things that are stereotypically male or female (eg, a dress with a beard) or presenting as ambiguous by being careful not to lean one stereotypical way or the other. If I am incorrect in my understanding of this (and I realize there is a spectrum and some may do things differently, or some may dress a certain way one day and another the next) please feel free to correct me.

I also understand though, that presentation and identity are very different. Theoretically, then, if there were no gender stereotypes, would this change the way gender non-conforming people identify, in the sense that sometimes they love their boobs (or lack thereof) and other times that doesn't feel right? Am I understanding this correctly? Also, how do you think this might change gender non-conforming presentation?

As a side note, isn't it just fun to play with and mix the stereotypes sometimes? If I could grow a beard I feel like I would have a huge one - and then wear lipstick everyday.

If I am completely missing the mark, please correct me.

I have been acting and dressing slowly but progressively more and more masculine. I feel more and more comfortable and confident as I do so. I dress almost exclusively in mens clothing, have mostly ""typically male"" mannerisms and interests/hobbies. I love passing as a man in everyday life, and I usually do at initial glance. I have a man's hair-cut, I am fairly muscular and broad shouldered, i have a masculine enough face, and my breasts are usually concealed with the shirts I wear. If I were to bind more often, work on deepening my voice, and maybe pack a little something, I am quite sure I could pass entirely.

There problem is the genderbending level I am at now. I mostly look like a guy, but I keep using my given name (which I hate) and using women's restrooms and in general keeping some level of a ""woman"" identity to the public eye, though I don't know how much of a woman I really am. I get yelled at or told off in women's restrooms almost every time I use a public one, and I worry that I may be a victim of violence if I continue to do so. I usually just try to find gender neutral bathrooms, but sometimes this is impossible. So one question of mine has been figuring out whether I need to just start using the mens room and maybe try to pass a little more so I can do so. I suppose the alternative would be to look a little more like a woman, but honestly the idea of feminizing myself is horrifying.

I suppose part of my question is how much one really needs to live in the gender binary. If I want to subscribe to the binary, I certainly want to be a man. I have wondered if I want to take T, and have not yet reached a decision because if I do so, I also want to change my name and try to get the government to recognize me as a man. However, I do not know that I would remove my breasts, and I would not get genital reassignment, so part of my wonders if I should just stay female. I guess part of it is I don't know if I am just a very masculine woman or if I am a man or what. The label matters to me because I am getting to a point of wanting change. My daily crossdressing is causing issues, and I sort of want to fit into the gender binary a little bit again.

Please feel free to ask questions, I don't really know what to put down really.

I have wondered if I want to take T, and have not yet reached a decision because if I do so, I also want to change my name and try to get the government to recognize me as a man. However, I do not know that I would remove my breasts, and I would not get genital reassignment, so part of my wonders if I should just stay female. I guess part of it is I don\'t know if I am just a very masculine woman or if I am a man or what. The label matters to me because I am getting to a point of wanting change. My daily crossdressing is causing issues, and I sort of want to fit into the gender binary a little bit again.\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions, I don\'t really know what to put down really. But if you have a story yourself, if you have been through a similar question yourself, please tell me what you did and why. I could really use some advice.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Help in figuring out whether I am just butch or if I am trans or genderqueer', 'created': 1412046476.0}",116.0

149,2014-09-30 10:46:42,2hvmx5,1,3,"I need some help, I'm very confused and wondering about the possibility that I might be trans* and the eventuality of some transition. 

**Background :** 

I am FAAB and 26 years old. I don't fit the trans narrative of ""always feeling in the wrong body"". I am bisexual, and have memories of ""wishing to be a boy"" when I was a kid, but it was so I could like girls. Also, I have known for long that ""if I was a man, I'd like to go by {androgynous-name}"". For a few years in high-school, I was over-girly but I might have been over-compensating a bit.

Due to having a crappy mother, I have reasons to have strong aversion to my secondary sexual characteristics. For a very long time, I have wished I didn't have breast, and to be sterile.

**What's going on:**

About one or two years ago, people around me seeming accepting of whomever I was, and some sexual experimenting with strap-ons, as well as learning a bit about trans* issues triggered some questioning and dysphoria. It kind of began when a lover told me he though of us as a gay couple, which kind of dragged my out of the closet. 

I realised I really, really prefer people assuming I'm a man. I also learnt that I can't masturbate without thinking I have a cock (Previously I never masturbated).

I am in the process of presenting more manly, which is great but makes me dysphoric because it points out how much my body doesn't fit as a male one.  I am short and very thin, with very big boobs. I still occasionally present as femme, which feels great (when rare) because I get so much social validation.

I talked about it with a few friends, a bit with lovers, and a lot with my partner. We talked about hysterectomy (which I always wanted, having a fertile uterus is a nightmare for me), and about top surgery. I'm afraid of modifying my body, but I can't get my mind off it.

**So here's the deal :**

- I do have genital and secondary sexual characteristics dysphoria, but it could be because of my own body-issues due to having a hateful mother.

- I find it very empowering to present more manly, but it's not really doable with this body, and it could be just because of patriarchy.

- I feel very good with people using neutral or male pronouns, but I'm not that hurt by people using female pronouns most times.

- In my sexuality with women, I'm much happier thinking of myself as a man, but it could be because I did a very late coming out and kind of constructed a ""hetero"" attraction to women.

- I don't feel any need to be considered as a man in my family : if I asked my brother or my father to use male pronouns with me, I'd surely be introducing much more gender in our relationship than there currently is. They know me well enough that they never assume anything about me due to me being a ""woman"". I feel like this has no importance whatsoever in our relationship.

So I have no idea if I could be trans*, if I'd be happier with a transition, if I could do some kind of half-transition to the middle and still administratively be a woman while presenting very androgyn, or even if this is real and not something I'm imagining.
