There are a bunch of cons though: I don't have any pronoun preference so for the most part I currently don't have a problem with how people talk about me (unless they specify the gender they assume I am).

    I’m doing a survey of non-binary pronoun use for my Language and Gender class.   It’s anonymous and mostly demographic information.  I’m trying to get an idea of who uses what pronouns and why, a topic that surprisingly hasn’t been studied before, as far as I can tell.

    If you use pronouns other than he/him/his or she/her/hers and/or if you identify as another gender besides man or woman, i would really appreciate it if you would take this survey.

During the technology-free nights, I had a lot of time to think about my gender identity. I've identified as genderqueer for the last few years, but I've come around to identifying as transfeminine now. For two reasons. Firstly, I realized that I always identify as female when I can ""get away with it"". Mainly in internet personas and other text-based media where my appearance and my voice doesn't have any bearing. Secondly, I'm pretty sure the only reason I identified as genderqueer was because my university's GLBTQ community is pretty shitty.

Somewhere along the line I got it in my head that I'm not allowed to be a girl, because I have a male body and male genitals and male bone structure and facial features and I'm not in a big rush to change those things given the physical trauma and outrageous expense. I think this is because people at my university are constantly having these more-queer/trans/feminist-than-thou pissing contests and cultivate this atmosphere of ""well if you can still pass as a man you're still enjoying male privilege so you're not really a woman"". Rather than let myself be pressured to change my body physically and chemically in ways I'm not yet comfortable with, I just decided ""I guess I'm genderqueer"". But shit, I've been walking around every day wearing entirely womens clothing (jeans and artsy t-shirts mostly), light makeup, a cute purse, and other decidedly not-stereotypically-masculine accessories for more than a year. It's not my fault I still read to most people as a super feminine gay guy instead of a girl. Other people's opinions of my appearance don't make my gender identity any less legitimate, right?

So I've decided I'm trans...and I don't know what happens next. I'm just about to graduate, and I'm going to have to fall back on pretending to be a cis/het man if I want to have a chance of getting (and keeping) a job. I'm not ready (and maybe I never will be, and that should be okay unless all the rhetoric of the GLTBQ community is really just so many empty words) to start messing with HRT or SRS right now, and I'm okay with that. I'd love to go on Facebook and say ""Hey everyone, I'm trans, she/her/hers now please."", but I've too much to worry about just finishing up my degree to want to deal with the fallout of that right now.

I guess I just want someone to tell me that it's okay for me to be trans, and that it's okay for me to identify as a girl even if I probably won't ""pass"" as female any time in the near future.

&gt; Ochoa began the process a decade ago when he won temporary guardianship of two children, a one year and three months years old boy and a 16 days old baby girl that were her neighbours. She had a warehouse where the largest used to go and stay with parental consent.

&gt; ""Parents  left them here to guard - she says to LA NACION-  Sometimes  a week passed by until they returned. Until one day, they didn't came, so I went to ask about it and they told me they were sick. As they do not bring them to the doctor, I did it with their permission. ""

&gt; At the consultation the doctor found that the boy had signs of violence, malnutrition, pneumonia and pneumonia. He ordered his hospitalization and reported the case to court. Ochoa took care of him in hospital and asked to be their temporary guardian when the possibility of put the children into the state care started to be considered as an option.

&gt; The custody was awarded until both parents ""changed their life and reorganize"" (they had addiction problems and work issues). Ochoa said they visited them for a while but then they stopped them.

&gt; She decided to move forward with the process to adopt them. It went to trough several stages of custody until in December achieved the full adoption. The court decision was not not spread until now.

&gt; ""Being a transsexual was never an obstacle. The Justice always prioritized the welfare of children,"" he told to La Nacion. Today the little girl is going to fourth grade and the boy to seconday school. She owns a store and a deli.

Ok, this is not entirely true, she defines herself as a travesty, and not as a trans, but first, you know most people would see any difference between the two, second second, this was more than *eleven freaking years ago*, so yeah, some concepts or way of thinking might have been different at that time.

In your view, what would be the effect of the proposed changes on the service?
 
Although the proposed changes are much better than previously, they do not go far enough. Trans people will still regard the NSS as discriminatory and will take legal action against the NHS to remedy that.
 
 
What further changes, if any do you think need to be made to this document?
 
The NSS are still classified as part of mental health specifications. Since it is a relatively simple administrative task to relocate the NSS from mental health, this does not appear to show good intention or good will on the part of the NHS.
 
The inclusion of ‘Psychological and Emotional Well-being’ and ‘Change in Mental Health’ as process indicators is inappropriate. Anyone who is treated successfully for any condition will experience improved psychological and emotional well-being, as a global default position, and the corresponding relief of stress will necessarily improve their mental health. Specifying these items in this context suggests an attempt to psychopathologise by the back door.
 
1.1.1 ‘This will include preparation for relationships, exploration of sexuality’ should read ‘At the request of service users, this may include . . .’ Many service users regard such discussions as prurient, irrelevant, or naïve and certainly, since women having bilateral mastectomy are not automatically subjected to discussions as to whether their surgery has made them reconsider their sexuality, this is a point of direct discrimination.
 
3.2.2 The inclusion of psychiatry is inappropriate and should be replaced with counselling.
 
3.3.1.x It should be the role of the GP to assess service users’ capacity to consent. The lead provider should have no role in this unless it suspects that the service user has lost that capacity to consent, in which case it should refer back to the GP. The current wording appears to comprise a back-door to providers refusing treatment or making it onerous simply because they disagree with the service user’s decision, which breaches the GMC rules on consent.
 
3.4.1.a) ii Psychological therapies ‘must be provided if clinical need is identified’: this is potentially sinister since it is not clear who will make such an identification, on what criteria it will be based, whether patient consent is required, or what the implications of provision are. Again, this might be interpreted as a back-door to lead providers refusing treatment or making it onerous simply because they disagree with the service user’s decision, which breaches the GMC rules on consent.
 
3.4.1.a) v ‘the number of which will be determined by need’ effectively writes a blank cheque for endless treatment, potentially against the service users’ wishes. This is financially irresponsible, quite different from other parts of the NHS where the number of treatment sessions is capped, and once again, might be interpreted as a back-door to lead providers refusing treatment or making it onerous simply because they disagree with the service user’s decision, which breaches the GMC rules on consent.
 
 
Are there any other considerations not reflected in the document that you wish to draw our attention to?
 
It is most important that any psychological therapies are transparent, specified in detail, with clear criteria and processes, and are wholly elective. The major medical inequity that trans people have experienced is the transfer to them, from male homosexuality, of brutal and ineffective psychological therapies. At present, these continue to be mandated by practice in GICs simply because the Interim Specifications leave latitude for that abuse. As the repeated reports of patients confirm, many of these psychological therapies have the character of conversion therapy, setting out to change the mind and behaviour of the client, and operating as a barrier to all other forms of treatment. This is a point of direct discrimination as well as breaching the GMC’s rules on consent.
Nonbinary people are mentioned as eligible for some treatments but not others (Genital surgeries, hair removal).
The NSS requires specialists to look for consistency of identity. Instead, it should recognise explicitly that someone can be ‘consistently’ gender fluid, bigender etc and qualify for treatment.
The NSS should clearly allow different pathways of treatments for nonbinary people – some nonbinary people might need a combination of treatments that might not usually be expected to go together in a binary trans person’s care plan.
The NSS treats nonbinary and non-gendered/agender people as two separate categories with fewer treatments (only ‘gender neutralising’ treatments) recommended for ‘agendered’ people. All trans people should have access to whichever treatments they need regardless of how they identify.
The rules for accessing bilateral mastectomy are different for cis women wanting the procedure as Risk Reducing Surgery compared to those for men and nonbinary people wanting the procedure as gender-related surgery. This is direct discrimination.
Trans people of all genders can be refused hormone treatments by their GP because they aren’t approved for use as part of gender reassignment, while cis people would not be refused the same medications if they went to their GP with low hormone levels. This is direct discrimination. While the NSS is clear that prescribing is outside its remit, to demonstrate joined-up policy-making it should be explicit about the measures the NHS is taking to remedy that discrimination.
The rules regarding consent continue to be routinely breached for trans people, who are mandated by practice to undergo psychiatric assessment. This is direct discrimination.
 
Would you like to provide any final comments?
 
Click Yes and on the next page, copy and paste:
 
The evidence base for psychiatric involvement is the RC Psych Good Practice Guidelines, and the WPATH Standards of Care, reflecting a ‘revolving door’ culture, in which the self-interested clinicians who wrote the NSS are part of the same networks (and in some cases the same people) as those who wrote the Good Practice Guidelines and who contribute to the conferences, journals, and culture from which WPATH derives. This is very problematic because it means that:
•       The evidence base is disingenuous and is a fabrication, just as it was for male homosexuality.
•       There is no externality to the NSS – it is solipsistic unsupported assertion.
•       Psychiatric involvement in this area of medicine is effectively unregulated and unevidenced.
Treatments for nonbinary people are described as more of a “complex clinical judgment” involving a greater number of gender specialists – this is discriminatory in comparison with treatment for binary people.
Access to treatment for all trans people should be based on informed consent and not implied gatekeeping. Nonbinary people should not be singled out for extra scrutiny. A choice and informed consent model would remove discrimination towards trans people and would provide psychiatry with an opportunity to prove its assertion that it provides a service that is valued by trans people.

A choice and informed consent model would remove discrimination towards trans people and would provide psychiatry with an opportunity to prove its assertion that it provides a service that is valued by trans people.\nClick on the final page to submit your comments.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Please help respond to an NHS Consultation (suggested answers provided)', 'created': 1428928474.0}"

29,2015-04-14 23:26:56,32mf9s,0,0,"I'm curious about the ways drag reflects on/affects trans people.

I just recently saw a post on Tumblr that rather angrily denounced drag queens (no mention of kings) in the following way: (The post below is a parodied statement of what ""I love drag queens!"" really means)

&gt;I find the idea of men wearing dresses and atypical femininity funny or something to gawk at. I do not understand that “passing” as a concept is something trans women deal with for safety reasons, because non-passing trans women are at high risk for violence. Drag for me (and many drag performers) does not represent that gender expression can be fluid, but rather makes a point of laughing at people who do not 100% pass as the gender they are performing as and gasping in shock at people who do pass because we see trans and/or nonbinary people as less than human and incapable of beauty or looking anything like attractive cis people.

Is this a common position/view? I had honestly never considered this before, and as someone who has enjoyed a good many drag shows, it was kind of startling. I personally don't think of it as laughing at men in dresses at all -- it's not humorous, it's a different kind of performance.

I can see the point this is making, to some extent. It is a very binary-enforcing thing to do... but is it wrong for people to play with gender in a way that isn't addressing serious gender identity? That is, drag performance enacts gender temporarily for entertainment purposes rather than identifying with that gender in a deeper sense.  Does this negate or demean trans people by its very nature?

Last night, J came out to me as not feeling like a male person.

Do you have any suggestions on how best to support J? They are very afraid that they will never be able to afford hormones/surgery and also they are generally very depressed and anorexic, also taking some kind of heavy antidepressant, to not-so-great effect.

I obviously am not going to out J to my parents, or to anyone. I am urging J to talk to a therapist, both about their depression and about the anxiety that comes along with coming out/being a non-cis person. 

My question is, what helped y'all when you were coming out / realizing you were trans? What are some good things I can do to support J (I mean, I'd literally jump in front of a tank for them)? What are things I should not do/ things that well-meaning people said or did that were not helpful?

I'm back at school now, and have been perpetually bothered by who i am and also why i'm not doing anything about it, outwardly anyway. I have about 2 years left of schooling, and currently feel like i should wait (should I?) to transition. The reasons will come with the root of the question:

I know it is terrible to assign gender roles to activities, and i wholeheartedly agree with that. However i'm not so sure the people that i would be telling have any grasp of that concept, so i will be approaching this from a societal norm perspective.

Most of my hobbies are what would be considered manly. I brew beer. I target shoot. I like cars, computers, and am really immersed in the tech world.

I used to be gung-ho republican in my earlier years but this whole experience has been eye-opening for me and now really value personal liberties and now see myself as a libertarian. The reason why I would wait to come out/transition is that due to my involvement in these circles, some of my friends are pretty religious and conservative.

I also don't want to cut out these people from my life, I still like them as friends no matter how much it hurts when they post or share transphobic things on facebook or bring them up elsewhere.

Don't get me wrong, she was really understanding and all around a great person, but since then I have been pretty uncomfortable with the thought of coming out to anybody else because I feel as though i will need to prove myself, which is something i feel i cannot do.

With all that said, I feel like it is time to open up to a few of my closer friends at school, who I can see remaining my friends for a long time. These friends and I are in the prospective stage of opening a business, and I feel like it isn't fair to keep this from them, and it would be a real load off my chest.

9,2015-04-02 20:57:53,318h8k,0,1,"Hi. I posted this on /r/nonbinary and someone said that I should post it here too. 

I think I'm non-binary, and probably agender, but I don't know if I should tell anyone. 

The pro would be: I dislike people referring to me as a man and even just thinking of me as a man, which everyone does now. I don't know why, it's just uncomfortable. So if I told people, then they would hopefully stop and I would feel a little better sometimes. 

There are a bunch of cons though: I don't have any pronoun preference so for the most part I currently don't have a problem with how people talk about me (unless they specify the gender they assume I am). Also since I wouldn't be asking people to change pronouns they might think me telling them is pointless and be annoyed or confused and forget to stop thinking of me as a man. Also no one in real life will understand it like everyone here does and I'll have to explain it and many people just might be like ""So what?"". And I'm really unconfident so when they question its validity I probably will too and make myself seem ridiculous and I'll end up just telling them to forget I said anything. Also I'm not even totally sure that I'm non-binary and I don't think I ever will be sure. It's difficult for me to grasp my own gender. I'm only like 50% sure I'm non-binary and 50% questioning. Also I don't ""look"" typically non-binary, which of course doesn't mean anything, but you know people.

Does anyone maybe have any advice? Thank you all so much.

So if I told people, then they would hopefully stop and I would feel a little better sometimes. \n\nThere are a bunch of cons though: I don\'t have any pronoun preference so for the most part I currently don\'t have a problem with how people talk about me (unless they specify the gender they assume I am). Also since I wouldn\'t be asking people to change pronouns they might think me telling them is pointless and be annoyed or confused and forget to stop thinking of me as a man. Also no one in real life will understand it like everyone here does and I\'ll have to explain it and many people just might be like ""So what?"". And I\'m really unconfident so when they question its validity I probably will too and make myself seem ridiculous and I\'ll end up just telling them to forget I said anything. Also I\'m not even totally sure that I\'m non-binary and I don\'t think I ever will be sure. It\'s difficult for me to grasp my own gender. I\'m only like 50% sure I\'m non-binary and 50% questioning. Also I don\'t ""look"" typically non-binary, which of course doesn\'t mean anything, but you know people.\n\nDoes anyone maybe have any advice?

I'm 20, dfab and have been identifying as genderqueer/demiboy for about 2 years now. My gender is kind of a weird thing, I get dysphoria pretty bad, and I can definitely best describe it as ""I should have been born male, but I'd still be genderqueer."" 

Because of this transmasculine thing, I've really seriously looked into hormones and legally changing my name to the one I've been using for the past couple of months. (It's Rhys,pronounced ""Reese"", which I like for a few reasons.)

The only thing with actually transitioning is that I'd only be interested in partially transitioning, that is, I don't want any physical surgery. I don't mind my binder, and I actually really enjoy my body, even on some of my more masculine days. As much as a penis sounds nice, It's not what I'm most dysphoric about. 

I've done some research into HRT and I know I'd like a lot of the changes. I also know some of the changes are reversible if you stop. I'd like my voice to be deeper, and my periods to stop. I wouldn't mind facial hair, since that can be shaved or not. 

I also wouldn't mind a more male body, but I still like my breasts and hips sometimes, which is where all the questions come in.  

Can you actually partially transition that way? By starting HRT and stopping after a while so that the irreversible changes are there, but the rest goes back to normal? I know it says facial hair growth is irreversible, so would it just keep growing and have to shave it if you stop taking T? Has anyone else done a partial transition this way or am I crazy for considering it? I know my periods would come back if I stop hormones, so would there be any other ways of stopping it for good? Are hormones even my best bet for this or should I look into something else?  I've also been told that working out would definitely tone me up and make me look more masculine, I'm naturally pretty short and scrawny. So could I just keep up a somewhat masculine body type that way after lowering my voice and such?

My gender is super complicated and it makes all of this super frustrating. I'd just rather be seen as male/androgynous rather than female/androgynous, but still have my feminine body when I want it. Maybe I'm just being crazy. Also, I am out to my mom and sister, but no one else in my family yet.

18,2015-04-03 19:49:52,31cg8f,17,19,"Pretty much what it says on the tin. I'm totally cool with just using the term genderqueer but I kinda want to figure out more about what am I beyond just focusing on identifying beyond the gender binary. I just feel that genderqueer is too broad a term to fully define me.

 I'm biologically female but I really identify more male, I guess. But I don't feel like I'm a transman who wants to transition. I do sometimes feel dysphoria but I can usually make that ""go away"" by playing a video game or whatever with a character who I created as the ""perfect"" me. (Saints Row is perfect for this). Like if there was a pill that I could take and wake up with a penis and beard and flat chest the next day, that'd be awesome, but I also don't mind my female bio parts so if the pill wore off I would be fine with that. I'm kinda weird in the fact that I'm ""hoping"" for an excuse to lop off my breasts (like my mom has cysty breasts and that always leads to a cancer scare so if I develop that I've already sworn to just get rid of them so I don't have to go through that). But like 77% of the time I'm cool with them. So I don't really WANT to get rid of them, but if the opportunity comes, I will take it.

I tend to wear more masculine clothes, too. I've identified as a lesbian for years so I guess you could describe the way I dress as being ""butch"". 

I'm fine with having long hair and wearing make-up on occasion. It just feels weird. I feel like if I was presenting male 24/7 I'd still have the long hair because I love man buns so I find myself wearing that. It makes me feel sexy and confident. And I don't feel weird wearing make-up except when it's eyeliner and mascara...but that's just because it makes my eyes feel weird and I don't like it. Generally I only wear make-up when I have to ""look pretty"" at some sort of grown-uppy setting (like when I went to the career fair at my university or when I went to a VIP event for a guest speaker or a job interview).

I'd love to grow a beard but know that you have to go on HRT to do that and that seems a bit much. 

And as for pronouns...well I've been called feminine pronouns all my life so I don't mind them but IDK if I'd prefer male pronouns. I don't think I'd like to use the gender neutral of their/xir/etc because it just sounds odd to me when speaking and writing. Of course, I'll still use those pronouns for someone else if that is what they prefer, but it just isn't for me, I think. 

Also, where does my sexuality fall in with this? Am I a mannish type person? Does that still mean I'm a lesbian? Am I straight? IDK what to even think.

As for the one thing I have figured out: the name. Alex is unisex and I've always loved it because it can be short for either Alexander or Alexandra. I kinda but don't refer to myself as Alex. Like, I call myself my birthname on occasion but Alex is new so I sometimes I forget to refer to myself as Alex but at the same time, opportunities to refer to yourself as anything other than I are few and far between.

 I identify as agender but find myself leaning towards a typically ""feminine"" presentation, usually with a more ""masculine"" cardigan. I really enjoy having boobs, but most of the time I like having them concealed with a sports bra.

I had every intention of showing her the ropes of womanhood but somewhere in that process I realized that I'm not quite a woman myself. Everything was cool for a few weeks until I told my other friends about this. They told me I was doing it for attention. I'm already an attention whore, so why not? One of them did not adjust to my change well at all and landed his ass in the psych ward for a week. I blamed myself exclusively even though I knew there was so much other bad shit happening in his life. We never spoke again. I stayed in the closet for a year and a half after that, convincing myself that they were right and I am a terrible person.
I went to college and a few trans people I made friends with changed that for me. I saw that yes, there ARE people who exist outside the binary and are happy about it. I came out again after MBLGTACC. I've been happy, but skeptical. Part of me still thinks I'm a teenage girl making it up for attention, a tumblerina special snowflake. Part of me still hates myself and scoffs at every genderqueer person I encounter. And it's because I was broken so early.

It seems like there are a ton of ways to live as openly genderqueer but I'm trying to get a better sense of what some of those are. I have a lot of questions and some of them might be a bit personal, so you can pick and choose questions to answer or just answer all of them. Thank you for your responses in advance!

1. How do you identify / explain your identity to others?

2. How have you physically transitioned, or how do you plan to transition?

3. How do you present (male / female / androgynous / gender fluid / etc)? Is it closer to your assigned gender or the opposite gender (if this is a relevant question, I know it's usually frowned upon to ask this)? Do you ""pass"" or have different people read you as different genders, or do people always read you as only one gender?

4. What pronouns do you use? How strict are you with making sure people use them and how vital are they to easing dysphoria?

5. Do you use a unisex/gender-neutral name, or a male/female name, and did you pick it yourself? 

6. How soon after meeting someone do you explain your gender and ask them to use non-gendered terms and your preferred pronouns?

7. How do people generally react? What would you say the ratio of positive to negative responses is? What are some questions you usually receive? 

8. What is dating like? How do you use dating sites and such?

9. Did you or do you plan to legally change your gender / name? (sub-question: in your country, does an ""other"" gender option exist?)

10. When there's only a male/female option on forms or for bathrooms or whatnot and you're forced to choose, what do you generally pick? How uncomfortable does it make you to choose? 

11. How do doctors tend to react to you being nonbinary, particularly doctors that specialize in trans stuff? Does it throw them off? Or do you always seek out NB-friendly doctors?

12. Do you yourself have trouble thinking outside the binary and seeing people as neither male nor female? Or are you closer to being ""gender-blind,"" as I've seen it called?

13. How active are you within the LGBT+ community? How much acceptance or resistance to nonbinary identities have you found there (particularly from the trans part of the community)?

14. What labels do you apply to yourself? Do you call yourself trans or just nonbinary / genderqueer? What about terms that imply gender like heterosexual / homosexual / gay / lesbian?

15. Do you have dysphoria? If so, what types, if not, how did you discover your identity and decide to transition (ie become openly nonbinary)?

16. If you have kids, what do they call you? Like mom instead of mother, dad instead of father, what have you found as a gender-neutral alternative? 

17. How and when did you discover your identity, and how soon after did you come out?

18. What are the biggest troubles or inconveniences that you've ran into in not being binary? Do you have any fears or concerns in relation to your gender?

I was wondering what's the different, if any between agender and neutrosis/androgynous?  I've ID'ed as agender for a while having felt that neither man nor woman suits how I feel and I felt like I didn't match either stereotypical gende role. however recently I've felt as if I'm both man and woman and that I an associate with both male and female activities etc. Sp is there any difference in the definitions I can use to see which I am? Can someone clarify them basically.   Is it simply a case of not on the binary scale/line as opposed to in the middle of it?

My worry is (admittedly slightly petty) that if I am actually neutrosis then people will judge me more because I'm more towards the girl end of the scale and I want to be feminine. I worry they'll do this because I'm male bodied and I feel it's less socially accepted for a male to cross the gender boundary than it is for a female. Can anyone console my worry?

Finally, is there word to describe oneself who is in the centre of the gender binary? Does non-binary still apply here?

106,2015-04-14 16:23:06,32ktfv,3,5,"Hey all.  I just want to get this out of my head: today I am dysphoric and none of my usual fixes are working.

I am somewhere in the demigirl-genderfuck-fluid-queer range and usually I am either comfy as neutral-fem or have an easily satisfied but strong inclination towards a particular gender set or aspects of gendered expression. It is like a persistent itch that I can scratch and usually, if I scratch the metaphorical itch fairly quickly and stop scratching if it fades, I feel really good. I do not typically consider myself to experience dysphoria in the sense of discomfort.

Today however, nothing is working. 

My day thus far: 
yay! it's sunny, 
&lt;hyper-fem mode activate&gt; let's dig out a sundress and maybe throw on some lipstick... 
&lt;brain switch flipped HARD&gt; NOPE.jpg let's put on khaki cargo shorts and a tshirt, 
&lt;still itchy&gt; apply binder and swap panties for boxers and junk, 
&lt;STILL itchy&gt; sat with it a bit to try to understand,
&lt;boy mode fading&gt; decided to try to force fem mentally, ended up changing into the dress but keeping boxers and junk.
&lt;blegh&gt; now I have scratched so hard I just feel uncomfortable in my skin.


In the past I've dressed androgyn or mixed and matched my presentation and that's been comfy but today I don't know what else to try.

Interestingly, I can usually use my self-perception of my face in the mirror to help figure out what I am feeling, but in each variant I felt I looked perfectly androgyn, 50/50 down the middle.

I am not sure if I am feeling agender right now or just some funky discomfort, nothing feels wrong per say, ie i am not dysphoric about any given body part or feature, but nothing feels empowering or 'right'. I am not finding that 'fuck yeah my outsides are AWESOME and totes match my insides' feeling. I know I am really lucky that I can very frequently achieve that, but it makes today worse as I have little/no practice in dealing with unresolved dysphoria.


Thanks for reading; hope you all have a good day.

I am genderfluid (MAAB), and I haven't told anyone about that. Although I do have friends and such, my feminine side feels lonely, if that makes any sense to you. I want someone I can talk to and just be a girl. 

I have let my feminine side out online, pretending to be a girl on chatrooms and such. But I stopped doing that since I don't want to lie to people, and lead them on. 

I just want to meet people who see me as girl, and that ignore the rest completely. 

I want to make friends and meet people, be it girls or guys, as a girl. I only feel comfortable through text-chatting, but that way I also believe anyone developing a relationship with me could 100% ""see"" me as a girl, not as genderqueer.

I hope I'm not breaking any rule, I just feel a little bit isolated when this side of me becomes more prominent. 

I'm not in a bad spot in my life, and I really have no urge to vent or talk things through with someone. I'm really just looking to meet people as a girl, and explore this side of me.

So, if anyone wants to talk, feel free to hit me up. Maybe we hit it off and become friends. :)

Can **you** help me out today? Please...

How can I **shift** to a more androgynous style? I am 21 years old. I was born in a male body. I dont feel like a boy inside though... 

I am going to a hair salon next week to get my hair dyed/highlighted. What should I dye/highlight my hair? Im also going to get a haircut. What haircut should I get? What are good androgynous choices... 

I want everything unisex and androgynous. I got the money and time and freedom. 

I am pretty slim/skinny. I am average height. White. Blue eyes. Lazy-eye. Long face. Natural brownish dirty blonde hair. Little of mild achne. Short-ish mid-length hair right now.

[Here are 12 recent photos of me that I just took today, with no filters. Maybe seeing me and what I look like right now, can help you give me advice/help/suggestions on getting a androgynous style!!!!'](http://imgur.com/a/gL3zS#0)

Please help as much as you can. I will be forever thankful. Feel free to write a huge comment or even comments telling your honest thought/tips/suggestions! :) I love long, very long helpful comments. 

Where could I shop online/in-person? What clothes should I get? What should I know about shopping for androgynous things......!??

What rings/bracelets/etc.. should I get???

What are some nice androgynous underwear? Are there even androgynous underwear.

Do you personally think I could personally pull off the androgynous look? I hope I dont look to boyish....... O_o

What should I know about androgynous style? Am I forgetting to ask anything?????????! 

How can I look 100% androgynous without surgery/hormones? :) Or atleast pretty androgynous. 

Please feel free to add anything else that you think I may want to know. 

:) &lt;3 :)

Hmmmmmm. My achne is slowly going away. My face used to be covered with achne, it is nearly gone!!! :) 

I may fix my lazy-eye someday. I got the money. I dont know though. Im starting to kinda like my lazy eye, I may just leave it. Im not worried about my eyes. They are big and blue and pretty I think. :D

I hate my current hair. Im excited to change it up next week. My hair texture is soft and wavey, I have my mom's hair.

I am 21 but I look younger than that. I look around 15-18 I think. I dont mind that. How can I play up my youthful looking body? That has to help me somehow. Maybe it will help me pull off a androgynous look..??? Lol.

I like indie old-fasioned old-soul hopeless-romantic type of fashion. How can I merge that with a androgynous look overall? 

I dont know what else to say. PLEASE feel free to ask me any questions if you got to. I may be forgetting to say something....? Lol, I hope not!!!!!

155,2015-04-25 08:11:24,33svzw,0,7,"Okay everyone I thought to write here after really coming to terms what I really am and what are the issues that have been bugging me for a long time. A lot of soul searching has been done. I would like to here your voices if the stuff I write makes any sense to you? 


I'm a 28 year old guy and I have idenfied as a guy for my whole life. But still I have felt for a really long time that I'm not really that typical man – this led me to doubt my gender and now here I will elaborate my thoughts and conlcusions. I maybe wouldn't go so far to say that I'm bigender. 


Best word I can come up with is being in between. Male but still...


Just look at ying and yang. I have both in me. 


What really clicked in my head recently was and interview of Tom Hardy, a really macho guy at least by his film roles and apperance. It makes so much sense to me. I feel like he just said something that makes me shout aloud ”bingo!”. There are others as well. And people who are just fine the way they look and with their bodies. Here's a quite from him: 


”In an interview with Now magazine, the former party-boy who has battled drink, drugs and crime to turn his life around, added: 'A lot of people say I seem masculine, but I don’t feel it. I feel intrinsically feminine. I’d love to be one of the boys but I always felt a bit on the outside.”


I wouldn't say I feel ”feminine” all the time. I feel that I'm a mixture of both – yet so aware of my feminine side that I can't claim I would be like ”other guys”.


Here's a chart I just created. The left corner indicates no dyshporia and the right corner dysphoria as its extreme form, maybe experienced by transsexual people.


Body dysphoria


|-x-------------------------|---------------------------------|
  
 

I'm totally okay with my body. No anxiety about body hair or beard or genitals. Or body shape. I've always like it and actually been thankful for it for being as beautiful as it is. But on some occasion I do shave my chest and down there...but never my legs. It is silly because when you shave and feel sexier but after few days I start missing the hair I already shaved! 


Social dysphoria


|-----------x---------------|---------------------------------|


I prefer male pronouns for myself and like my name given at birth. Having a female name would feel just not fitting...


I experience social dypshoria in the sense that in my heterosexual relationships I'm afraid to show my feminine traits especially in the bedroom. I prefer sex that is more diverse. The role thing with male aggression and female submissiviness doesn't feel righ. I like to play both roles myself as well. This also affects gay relationships because many gay men have a distaste for male feminity. Kind of in a passive role I like to play the feminine role and enjoy it. My best experience have been with women who were bisexuals as well. That's the ideal. 
I have experiented with crossdressing but full famale attire and makeup...doesn't feel that good. Although there is no denying that to dress in a androgyneous way makes me feel sexy. In public I wouldn't still like to do that. 


My social dysphoria also comes from my own ideals about what masculinity should be. I always have had really high standarts for myself. Now I am starting to feel that there is no one way of being masculine. It makes me feel relaxed. 


I have an insight that soul really does not have gender.

- When did you realise that there was a term for how you connect to gender?
- How did you/how are you going about the mental and social transition into identifying yourself as nonbinary?
- Have you found people have made a big deal or has everybody been fine?
- Do you differentiate and/or make a point of stating the difference between your biological sex and gender? Why, why not?
- Have you or do you plan to take HRT for some effect or is recognising the difference within yourself enough for you personally?
- Which pronouns do you use for yourself and what are your feelings on the various gender-neutral ones?
- What do you feel about the terms 'girlfriend' and 'boyfriend', as well as 'groom' and 'bride', and 'husband' and 'wife'?

Now I'm beginning to wonder if NB is a kind of trans? Because... it's not cis. I keep dithering about changing my name to something gender-neutral (""but all my branding! my domain name!""), and I feel weird about the fact that I called myself mom's daughter last night (without thinking; I keep musing on the fact that *mom has two kids, and at least 1 son*, and that is how I mentally phrase it). I'm doing a lot of dwelling on this. I still haven't told mom. Hell, I still haven't shown mom the documentary I did on my depression.

It doesn't hurt when people who don't know **ME** refer to me as a woman/miss/whatever, but it bothers me when I accidentally do (identity inertia is a thing, tho, and it's hard to overcome).

162,2015-04-26 01:50:37,33vntf,8,5,"So, growing up (AFAB), I was not a typical girl as I didn't like wearing overtly feminine clothes (though I was VERY fond of wearing overalls with cars on them and a jacket with an airplane design...tbh, I don't recall them ever being referred to as ""boy clothing"" so I probably just liked how they looked).  I played with matchbox cars a lot, as well as stuffed animals; I played with Barbies to an extent, but had no interest in baby dolls (my mother thought this was a sign of abnormality and was yelled at for not being ""normal"" over this).  Through elementary school, I mostly dressed like a tomboy though there were some times where I wore girlier clothes to fit in with my friends or popular girls.  When I could pick my own clothes, I wore girls' versions of masculine clothes (it was the 90s so I wore cargo/carpenter pants and square t-shirts, fleece vests, bucket hats, skate shoes, etc.).  When I was in middle- and high school, I ""was gothic"" and wore a mix of clothes from the boys and girls sections and referred to myself as ""gender neutral"".  I also had a male persona I would sometimes adopt (I pretended to be him, it's not like I had MPD); I posed as him online on a message board and I suppose it made me pretty happy to interact with people as a(n albeit androgynous) boy.

I dressed more feminine in college, but I was super uncomfortable, awkward, and just trying to blend in.  Shit was going on in my life, shit bombs going off left and right, and I started drinking to deal with stuff and did so for about 4 years.  After college, I drifted back toward being more androgynous.  Having been sober for 2 months as of this week, I've realized I have to actually start *dealing with* stuff I feel.  I have to figure out *why* I feel uneasy and what I have to do to get over it, not just go ""LOL BOOZE MAGIC TIME MACHINE""

When I have to select on a form if I'm a Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms. I hesitate because I don't feel like any of those describe me.  If it's for something that doesn't matter, I call myself Rev. even if that is inaccurate (or is it? I'm an internet-ordained minister...)  Going back to school so I can go by Dr. is out of the question (j/k).

I feel more like a peer around men than around women.  When I presented myself more femininely (), I got frustrated because men went into well-meaning-though-pedantic chivalry-mode around me and acted awkward when all I wanted to do is be a peer.  Around women I feel more detached like an observer, but sometimes I get all ""Guuuuuuuurl! Muh bitchez!!!"" but I feel more like a really camp gay man than a honest-to-all-gods woman.

Physically, I feel more attractive for my masculine traits (broad shoulders/chest, muscle tone, prominent/angular facial features, etc.) than I am about my boobs and stuff.  Thankfully, I'm not super curvy, but I pretty much just ignore my boobs and hips.  They're not my favorite but they're attached to me anyway.  I got bangs/fringe in January and though it looked really good, it was too feminine for me to deal with looking at, and I'm impatiently growing them out so I can look like myself again.

Despite all that, I'm ok with my body and don't want to change it, but if by magic or something I could have a male body with average male height (I'm 5'4""), my family would act as though I were always their son/grandson/nephew, my job acted as though I was hired as a man, and my s/o turned gay and still felt the way he does now, I would probably do it though I'd probably still wear skinny jeans, and have long hair (I'm sort of gothic so this would probably not be outside the realm of gothic maleness).

However, I feel this is too difficult for my s/o to talk about.  We talked about it before, and he acted afraid I was going to get a sex change.  I've explained my male alter ego to him and he had some questions in the vein of ""Are you actively trying to become him?""/""Is that who you actually are?"" and I sense a bit of uneasiness in him.  Now he gives me side-eye of any discernibly masculine sartorial choices.  I bought some patent-pleather oxford shoes to wear to work and when I told him I thought they were sexy, he implied he didn't like them at all.  Maybe he would have hated them, regardless, but I haven't gotten these kinds of reactions to my appearance before I brought up gender...I probably did the equivalent of ""don't think about pink elephants"".

Does anyone have any (nice) thoughts? (No ad hominems please)

Any advice for me?

Please excuse any incorrect terminology, I am new to this.

I played with matchbox cars a lot, as well as stuffed animals; I played with Barbies to an extent, but had no interest in baby dolls (my mother thought this was a sign of abnormality and was yelled at for not being ""normal"" over this).  Through elementary school, I mostly dressed like a tomboy though there were some times where I wore girlier clothes to fit in with my friends or popular girls.  When I could pick my own clothes, I wore girls\' versions of masculine clothes (it was the 90s so I wore cargo/carpenter pants and square t-shirts, fleece vests, bucket hats, skate shoes, etc.).  When I was in middle- and high school, I ""was gothic"" and wore a mix of clothes from the boys and girls sections and referred to myself as ""gender neutral"".  I also had a male persona I would sometimes adopt (I pretended to be him, it\'s not like I had MPD); I posed as him online on a message board and I suppose it made me pretty happy to interact with people as a(n albeit androgynous) boy.\n\nI dressed more feminine in college, but I was super uncomfortable, awkward, and just trying to blend in.  Shit was going on in my life, shit bombs going off left and right, and I started drinking to deal with stuff and did so for about 4 years.  After college, I drifted back toward being more androgynous.  Having been sober for 2 months as of this week, I\'ve realized I have to actually start *dealing with* stuff I feel.  I have to figure out *why* I feel uneasy and what I have to do to get over it, not just go ""LOL BOOZE MAGIC TIME MACHINE""\n\nWhen I have to select on a form if I\'m a Mr., Mrs., Miss, or Ms. I hesitate because I don\'t feel like any of those describe me.  If it\'s for something that doesn\'t matter, I call myself Rev. even if that is inaccurate (or is it? I\'m an internet-ordained minister...)  Going back to school so I can go by Dr. is out of the question (j/k).\n\nI feel more like a peer around men than around women.  When I presented myself more femininely (), I got frustrated because men went into well-meaning-though-pedantic chivalry-mode around me and acted awkward when all I wanted to do is be a peer.  Around women I feel more detached like an observer, but sometimes I get all ""Guuuuuuuurl! Muh bitchez!!!"" but I feel more like a really camp gay man than a honest-to-all-gods woman.\n\nPhysically, I feel more attractive for my masculine traits (broad shoulders/chest, muscle tone, prominent/angular facial features, etc.) than I am about my boobs and stuff.  Thankfully, I\'m not super curvy, but I pretty much just ignore my boobs and hips.  They\'re not my favorite but they\'re attached to me anyway.

Welcome to tonight's ramble and the usual 'Does anybody else ____?'

I still feel fairly new to expressing the full range of my gender and that has been great overall but a few times now I have found myself slipping into full dude-mode when I am not wanting to deal with being upset or some stressful situation that I can't do much about.
I don't want dude-mode to become dissociative or be just an escape from my normal life. I also feel a bit bad about this because I feel like I'm engaging the stereotype/expectation that men aren't emotional, which is shitty and stupid.

The obvious thing is to just not let myself dude-out when i'm upset but then idk if i'll be dysphoric or what.

Any thoughts on this?
 


Stuff that is specific to me that y'all don't have to deal with if you don't want to:
Background on me atm: AFAB, super fluid presentation, dude-mode has developed to the point of having a wardrobe and a name over the past month. 
Reasons I am not ok: I'm facing ongoing family health issues, severe relationship difficulties, finals week, graduation, and am just getting off the red tide.  
I have a history of PTSD. It was thoroughly treated a couple years ago and so it doesn't really enter my day to day life any more, but the above has started to bring out old traits.

* I buy some new clothes, a short and a t-shirt with a floral pattern, she calls them gay and feminine, even before I buy them she asks if I like floral stuff in particular [because I feel I'm a girl]. Tbh I've not stopped asking her opinion on clothes I buy. 

* I'm getting changed and she just come swanning into my room and catches a glimse of my chest. She grabs my shirt living it to and upon seeing my bare chest, asks if I shaved it. What the fuck does it matter!? I say no, (I had) knowing that if I say yes she'll rant about me possibility wanting a sex change and to be a girl even though I've told her in don't. 

* I still cycling to focus on my exams but continue shaving my legs because I've grown used to it and continue to swim, she asks if I'm doing it because I want to be a girl. I'd previously told her I don't want to be a girl thus I'm clearly just shaving my legs because, as a *person* I prefer it. 

* I comment on a person on TV saying she has a lot of makeup on. My mum  says ""why you saying that!? So you wanna wear makeup?"" I say no, knowing that if I say yes she'll instantly assume I'm actually a transsexual, insist upon buying me some and assume I'm depressed if I then don't wear it because I've lost my 'coping strategy' for dysphoria which I've told her I get very little of and I actually am fond of my body. 

* she asks a periodic intervals, maybe every week, if I'm still having ""those feeling"" and if I've had anymore thoughts about my gender and if I still don't want a sex change. It seems all she cares about is preventing me at all cost from getting a sex change even though I never will. She then doesn't accept no as an answer. 

* she assumes I'm going to get a girlfriend as if she can read the future, she still calls me her ""little boy"" even though I've given her many resources of various forms that tell her explicitly - as well as telling her myself - that agender means I'm not a boy or a girl and thus she should infer from that that calling me boy is pissing off...let's not even start on pronouns, just no. 

* I say I want to grow my hair to be longer like that of [Dan Croll](http://hangout.altsounds.com/geek/gars/images/2/2dancroll.jpg) and she has a fucking hissy fit. ""Oh why do you want to grow your hair, is it because you want to be a girl!? Well, you can't! Your hair won't grow like that, it's the wrong type of hair!"" Bullshit! She's a fucking control freak birch.

Now idk about you but I'd say that's not a very accepting mother, would you? She moans that its all too much for her to take in and that my coming out letter - in which I said I was gender fluid and also included an overview of trans stuff including that some get surged and that I don't want that - was a big shock. That was a year ago. Since I've talked to her, given her general info on trans stuff and specific agender stuff in the form of articles, blogs, videos, diagrams. Honestly, I dint know what the fuck to do. She says when I no longer refuse to answer her silly self-centred question of ""do I still want a sex change again"" that I'm being rude and inconsiderate. Fucking inconsiderate! How about me!? She's far from accepting and even when I slap it in her face the information that she's not accepting just goes over her head. I hinges,h cannot wait until university in September but until then, please....help? She's just driving insane. My dad just stays out of it and seems not to want anything to do with it. :( I just wanna be myself and that doesn't involve too much: more feminine/indie clothing, makeup, longer hair, my neutral name and pronouns, shave legs and wax chest, is that too much to ask? 

Thanks

The reason I ask the title question is that I've challenged myself to run a serious, multi-faceted character in a campaign of Dungeons and Dragons, and I was really taken by the section in the Player's Handbook on Gender and Sex: 

&gt;You can play a male or female character without gaining
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how
your character does or does not conform to the broader
culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual
behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the
traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could
be a reason for your character to leave that society and
come to the surface.

&gt;You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often
seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example,
and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s
image. You could also play a female character who
presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a
female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual
orientation is for you to decide.

And so I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to explore the idea of gender as it relates to elves - a species created in the image of a deity whose gender is fluid and/or indeterminate?

And so I've been working really hard to make a character whose gender isn't unimportant (since gender is a huge part of each person's self-identity) but is not defined themself by their gender(s), but instead by personality, backstory, methods, and companions (the character is a noble, and as such can have three assistants follow them around to help).

And I've played the character in two sessions, and I've really enjoyed playing them, and I feel the genderfluidity is a subtle-but-important part of the character even though it hasn't factored into the game at all (since the character has identified as a male during the events of both sessions). 

But I asked a friend of mine (for whom non-binary gender identity is a big interest because they are genderqueer) for some resources that would allow me to better understand genderfluidity and thus portray the character better, and she said that she really took offense to my doing this (making the character) because it is oppressive and appropriates the genderfluid experience. She pointed out examples of this oppression in acting - primarily, that trans and other genderqueer people have not been permitted to portray trans and genderqueer people.

Now, I'll be completely honest - right now, I don't see how what I'm doing is oppressive or appropriating. I'm actively trying to treat genderfluidity realistically and as a whole aspect of the character, rather than just tacking it on because it sounds cool or funny, and I'm not stealing an acting job from a genderqueer person. Furthermore, my view on acting is that trying to get into the head of and portray to the best of your ability a character who is different from you is what acting is all about.

That said, I am a straight, white male, and from my involvement in supporting Feminism and LGBTQ rights I've learned that being a white, straight, guy means that you often don't see the problems and/or issues that arise around subjects like this. I've posted here because I want to try to understand what I'm doing by attempting to create and portray a genderfluid character and any problems that will arise from that.

The reason I ask the title question is that I've challenged myself to run a serious, multi-faceted character in a campaign of Dungeons and Dragons, and I was really inspired by the section in the Player's Handbook on Gender and Sex: 

&gt; You can play a male or female character without gaining
any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how
your character does or does not conform to the broader
culture’s expectations of sex, gender, and sexual
behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the
traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could
be a reason for your character to leave that society and
come to the surface.

&gt; You don’t need to be confined to binary notions of
sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often
seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example,
and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon’s
image. You could also play a female character who
presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a
female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being
mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character’s sexual
orientation is for you to decide.

And so I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to explore the idea of gender as it relates to elves - a species created in the image of a deity whose gender is fluid and/or indeterminate?

And so I've been working really hard to make a character whose gender isn't unimportant (since gender is a huge part of each person's self-identity) but is not defined themself by their gender(s), but instead by personality, backstory, methods, and companions (the character is a noble, and as such can have three assistants follow them around to help).

And I've played the character in two sessions, and I've really enjoyed playing them, and I feel the genderfluidity is a subtle-but-important part of the character even though it hasn't factored into the game at all (since the character has identified as a male during the events of both sessions). It's weird - in terms of the character's significant personality traits (pleasant and nice to be around, fanatically loyal to their noble family, can be very cruel and disregarding of lives when it is necessary), being genderfluid doesn't make much of a difference, but at the same time, I feel like making the character not genderfluid would make them ""not the same character"" or something. 

But I digress. Anyway, I asked a friend of mine (for whom non-binary gender identity is a big interest because they are genderqueer) for some resources that would allow me to better understand genderfluidity and thus portray the character better, and she said that she really took offense to my doing this (making the character) because it is oppressive and appropriates the genderfluid experience. She pointed out examples of this oppression in acting - primarily, that trans and other genderqueer people have not been permitted to portray trans and genderqueer people.

Now, I'll be completely honest - right now, I don't see how what I'm doing is oppressive or appropriating. I'm actively trying to treat genderfluidity realistically and as a whole aspect of the character, rather than just tacking it on because it sounds cool or funny, and I'm not stealing an acting job from a genderqueer person. Furthermore, my view on acting is that trying to get into the head of and portray to the best of your ability a character who is different from you is what acting is all about.

That said, I am a straight, white male, and from my involvement in supporting Feminism and LGBTQ rights I've learned that being a white, straight, guy means that you often don't see the problems and/or issues that arise around subjects like this. I might think I'm not being oppressive or appropriating when I actually am. I've posted here because I want to try to understand what I'm doing by attempting to create and portray a genderfluid character and any problems that will arise from that. I *don't* want to be an ignorant arsehole, even by accident! I'm not looking for validation for my actions. I'm looking for the truth, or at least as close to the truth as you can get with a topic centered mostly around personal experience.

41,2015-04-29 05:48:11,348w1n,18,11,"So, yeah, I'm the person who [posted about wanting to make a serious, non-comic-relief genderfluid character for their D&amp;D group](http://www.reddit.com/r/genderfluid/comments/3370ij/rgenderfluid_how_do_you_feel_about_gnderfluid/), and after mulling the responses to that topic over in my mind, I've decided to give it a shot.

For those who didn't want to scroll through the wall of text in the link post, my character is a biologically female elf assassin and the youngest child of the head of a minor noble house (all of who are also assassins). I was inspired to play a non-cisgender elf character for two reasons: first, a passage in the D&amp;D rulebook on character sex and gender; specifically, it stated how the elf deity Corellon Larethian seems to have no set gender or sex - it changes depending on the versions of the legends - and sometimes is even written as hermaphroditic. It continued to say that some elves are made in the image of their deity, and I really liked the idea that the elves would view sex and gender differently than other species normally would, due to nature of their creator and their resulting relative lack of sexual dimorphism. 

The second reason I thought about playing a genderfluid character is because I'd challenged myself to play a character that wasn't just comic relief, one that I could take seriously, and I thought it could me if I made a certain aspect of that character something that I do take very seriously and couldn't bring myself to make light of - in this case, LGBTQ issues (of which I consider myself a supporter).

Anyway, I have a few questions I hoped I could get answered that might help me portray the gender-fluid part of my elf character better. If you think I'm not asking something that I should know, please feel free to mention it. 

Lastly, I want to make it clear that I'm not asking for a description of some overarching ""experience"" that is true of every genderfluid person. I just want to here your experience and what things were like for you as an individual. 

1. As far as I understand it, being genderfluid means that your gender (which is, of course, different than your biological sex) changes back and forth rather than being a fixed thing. How often does that change occur?

2. What is that change like? Does it happen over a period of time? Do you realise that it is happening? Or does it (and I hope I'm not being weird or insensitive here) change while you're asleep? I'm just trying to get an accurate view of when gender changes occur for genderfluid people and how it feels. 

3. What kind of personality changes occur when your gender changes? Do you feel more like a different person (not like ""multiple personality disorder"", just, is it a radical change to your personality) or do you still feel recognisably the same, but with some personality stuff?

4. How do you express your gender?

If you respond, it would be helpful (but certainly not necessary if you feel comfortable doing so) for you to put your physical sex in the response, just so I can get an idea of the different ways different sexes deal with genderfluidity and the body parts that may not match their gender at times. It's a practical thing - I like to draw my characters a lot, and figuring out mundane stuff like clothing and gear is important for me when it comes to portraying a character. In past cases, I've never had to deal with a female-sex character wanting to consistently and regularly appear as a man, so tips about that would be helpful. 

Again, if any of these questions are out of line, i'm really sorry, and I'd appreciate it if you could please politely but firmly let me know. And if there's anything else you think I should know so that I can accurately portray this aspect of the character, please mention it.
