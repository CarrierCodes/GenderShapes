I have been attracted to trans women for a bit and brought it up to my girlfriend recently. I was so excited she didnt judge that I was attracted,  but she was a bit concerned about what that 'meant'.

Now, I in no way mean to be disrespectful of anybody, and want to point out that I dont like that trans girls get objectified in porn,  but thats what porn is about... and I guess who am I to judge the fine line between power and attention or whatever porn is.... but, I had sex with my girlfriend tonight with trans related porn and transition videos.

I wanted to share my experience with my girlfriend, she didnt judge me, and would consider maybe experimenting with more things like this.  She was concerned I may be gay or want to transition myself, which is not what I want.

Once again, I dont want to objectify anybody. . But honestly is there any hope in making a trans friend or finding a community or swingerss/trans party without objectifying the 3rd wheel?

A friend pointed me to this site, and mentioned how supportive the community was here? Um, to give you a bit of context, I'm a 25 year old student, and moved away from my home country to attend college. I'm visiting my parents for summer vacations, and wish to come out to them. I wrote a letter that I plan to read out loud to them, and was wondering if it would be possible to ask the people here for their opinion on what I'm telling them, and whether I should add something else to it...I'm honestly terrified, my hands have been shaking just writing the letter, and I would really appreciate any suggestions or reassurance you might be able to offer? Thank you, so so much, for taking the time to read through this!

---------------------------------------------------------------------
[Names of my family],
I want to start by telling you that I love you. Your support and approval throughout my life have been important to me beyond words, and the bond we share as a family spending time together, caring for each other, is very precious to me. You might feel worried, confused, or upset by this, and I want to reassure you, before continuing, that I'm okay; I'm not sick, and I'm not in legal trouble. I'm really, really sorry if I worried you with this letter; I just want to tell you how I feel about certain things in my life, and help you understand my feelings a little better? Reading this to you is very difficult for me, so, I'd like to ask you for a bit of patience if it takes me some time to go on at any moment.

I've always been a very introverted person. You've all commented on it at some point; asked why I don't spend time with friends, or go out more often over weekends. Why I don't seem to meet a lot of new people, or keep my feelings to myself. Mom, you've asked me a hundred times if I was okay, to let you in, to tell you how I felt, and...I couldn't, for the same reason I can't tell other people the same, or talk about myself. I find it hard to show my feelings to others, because I'm afraid of being ridiculized, judged, or made fun of. Every conversation I have with people involves me showing my accomplishments to others; grades, titles, black belts, aspirations, trying to earn their approval because I feel, deep down, that they would never approve of me or love me if I didn't have any of those. I've felt depressed for a very long time, but thought I was supposed to bear it and carry on; that life was supposed to be hard, and it was like that for everyone. It has been difficult, made doubly so because I kept pushing away anyone who tried to get close to me, hid all of my feelings away from even you, my family. 

Throughout my entire life, I never felt like I fit in around the people I was expected to spend time with; that's not to say that I didn't have fun sometimes, but there was always something that didn't quite fit, something that felt wrong. I think you know that school was a difficult time for me, and I was bullied a lot; if not, I'm very sorry I hid that from you, too. I tried my best to adapt and fit in, and by high school, things were tolerable; I was never fully part of ""the group"", but at least I had a few people I spent time with, if never relaxed 100% around. I dedicated myself to my studies and my career, to become the best I could be in my field, leaving aside personal relationships and friendships, because it was easier to ignore them, to live alone, to find validation in being good at what I work on and bury my feelings inside. However, it has gotten to the point where I can't bottle this up any longer, where I can't keep going without confronting what I have locked away within myself. I want to share this with you, and be honest with you.

I'm transgender. I've felt I should have been born female for a very long time, wished I could be a normal girl at birthdays silently, even used to pray for it when I still prayed. There is a very negative image of what being transgender means in popular media, and just in case you have that impression, I want to make sure I'm being clear enough for you, so that you can understand; this doesn't mean I want to dress up because of some kind of sexual reason, or to put on an act. This has nothing to do with my sexuality, actually, or who I like, which is something I've never known because I'm completely unable to imagine myself with someone, male or female, while I'm expected to be male. This just means that I'm a woman, like half the population of the planet, and wish to be myself and live happily without having to hide who I am. I'm tired of filtering every thought I have, every word I want to say, to make sure it's something a boy would say. I'm tired of imitating people around me to try to find out how I'm supposed to act, and I'm tired of being scared all the time that someone will find out what I feel. I'm tired of hating my body, my appearance, and of having to hide that hatred.

I mentioned seeing a therapist this semester when we talked while I was away; she has been helping me come to terms with who I am, with the feelings I've hidden, but I want you to know that this is something I've come to realize on my own. It's not something I've chosen; I've hoped my entire life for it to go away, and life would certainly be a lot easier if it had, if I hadn't been born this way, but it's been on the back of my mind through both good times and bad times. I've come to accept that it's not going away. This is who I am, and it's not going away. The choice I do have, however, is whether to do something about it. Whether to continue living in hiding, or try to do something to help myself.

I'm not changing who I am. I'm still the same person, I'm still the child you raised. I still love you with all my heart, and want to make you proud. I still want to be a great engineer, and use my career to help others. I have wanted to tell you this for so long, but was terrified of losing you, of hurting you, of upsetting you. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sure we will have many conversations about this soon, and maybe you might feel upset or confused; I want you to know that I understand that this is difficult for you, too, and I'll try to be as open as I can, to be here for you as much as possible. You don't have to do anything right now, and if you need some time to process and understand this, that is okay too. 

I love you, more than I can express with words, and will never stop loving you,
[My name]

So, I am a teenager who, for my entire life, has identified as a male. Lately, though, I've started to wonder if that's how I really want to identify. I have not told anyone, even my therapist, about any of these feelings, and, for a long time, figured they'd just go away. While I did not always hate the idea of being a boy, I did always hate the idea of becoming a man. The facial hair, the deepening of my voice, you name it. Hell, when I was thirteen, I once got so nervous in public that I ran into a bathroom and literally tried to rip off my sideburns with my fingers.

I keep finding myself lurking on trans forums and googling questions about the whole ""transitioning"" thing, and I have to say, I feel right at home in the company of so many people who feel very similar to the way I do. Of course, I feel like I am in such a situation that transitioning or even so much as telling anyone would basically ruin my life. Because of this, I sometimes wonder if killing myself would relieve some of these feelings, seeing as I have no other way to do so.

Anyway, I've been thinking about what to do with my hair as up until this point my hair has been, for all intents and purposes, the same for maybe 4 years. In a bid to try and help, a friend of mine sent me a stack of pictures of guy's hairstyles, 1 of which i was kinda ""meh"" about. And that was the most positive reaction to any.
I didn't really know why i disliked all of these hairstyles, most of which are apparently super popular, which got me onto thinking about girl's hairstyles, specifically short ones. So i had a look for short pixiecut-ish kinda things (http://imgur.com/a/Z0FDG) and started to notice a surprising similarity between these and the trend that has become guy's undercuts. But unlike all the ""guy's"" styles I'd seen, i actually really like the styles these girl's had ( A feeling feeling I've never had about any haircut I've gotten, they have always been meh). To a point it was because these were just nicer cuts than the pictures I'd been sent, but mostly the fact that they were that bit more feminine and I think that's what I want. Along with that is the fact that for ages now i've been wanting to be perceived as at least somewhat feminine.

How do you deal with it, and is there anything I can do to convince my parents to at least make an effort to properly gender me?\n\n\nSorry for all the anger.

31,2015-05-06 09:08:07,351gp1,10,4,"Hi,

I am here because I would really appreciate some unbiased thoughts on my situation. 

I am a married biological male in my early 30s, and for years I have been struggling with some gender identity issues. I look and act like the average man, but the truth is that I have a very strong... how shall I call it... ""unmasculine"" side. Part of me longs for everything that is commonly stereotyped as being ""feminine"" (or ""Yin"", if you will), from behaviour to clothing to sexuality, but most important of all, that part of me wishes to be acknowledged by the world. Thing is, I also have a male part, and that part is obviously more aligned with the kind of characteristics, behavioural, visual and sexual, commonly associated with manliness.

The net result is, as you can imagine, a mess: part of me wishes to grow a full beard, the other part wants his (her? Its?) legs shaved. Sometimes I'll see a pretty woman on the street and while part of me will picture her in a variety of lustful scenarios, the other part will think *""I wish I could fill that dress like that""*. And these are just simple, aesthetics-related examples. I could also discuss the emotional, behavioural and sexual aspects, but I think you get what I'm trying to say: I want things that are completely incompatible with each other. I want to be manly, but at the same time I want to be feminine. To make matters worse, these two sides never really balance out, but kind of fluctuate over time: I can go through a six month ""manly"" spell, and then one day, for no obvious reason, my other side will erupt and suddenly I find myself daydreaming of how nice, how *fulfilling* it would feel to be a housewife (please, feminists of reddit, don't hate me for this: believe me, I *know* being a woman is *not* defined by cooking, ironing shirts and making the husband happy at night, I *know* that women can be as ambitious and achieve great things as much as men, and I am in no way trying to suggest otherwise: I am only talking about what part of me desires, *please* do not try read any kind of gender role judgement into this).

My wife doesn't know. I'm pretty sure I would have told her if I had known at the beginning, but I only came to fully understand my feelings several years into our relationship and by then, I couldn't find the courage in me to tell her (and I don't intend to, either: I know for a fact that she would suffer greatly).

So, now you more or less know what my problem is. My questions to you are: what am I? Right now I only know what I'm not: I'm not a woman, but I don't fully feel like a man, I'm not gay, but I'm not heterosexual either, I'm not a crossdresser and I'm not transgender (because, honestly, I think I'd still not feel completely comfortable as a woman, although possibly slightly more comfortable than now). So what the heck am I? Is there a name for people like me? And also, is there anything I can do to give my ""unmasculine"" side some much needed relief while staying safely in the closet?

Background info: I'm 17, in a fairly small school with students that are relatively xenophobic towards anything not the norm. 

I decided to start with my science teacher since I trusted him. Handed him a note about it and so he asked if I could help him set up a lab after school which I agreed to. 

I proceeded to start a text conversation with my girlfriend about it, and had to explain the entire concept to her. She was confused and brought up a decent fuss about it, but I had to put the conversation on pause as we both had to get through class. 

So after school I'm setting up a lab with my science teacher (his biology class was doing a lab on fly genetics). We started talking about it and I was scared out of my mind but he was pretty accepting. He even agreed to use gender neutral pronouns if I ever fully came out (made me ecstatic).

So after I start heading home I continue the conversation with my girlfriend. Now, she's the one person who could say a word and break me with that word. We've been together in a long distance relationship for over four years now, and even met recently (I flew to her state for the weekend over summer break).

We get to the point where I ask her to start using gender neutral pronouns and here's where she flips the actual heck out. She calls me, yelling at me for it and saying she will NOT refer to me as anything but male, EVER. This is where I tried to end the conversation because I was starting to break down. I told her that I had to get started on my homework, which was partially true. As soon as the call ended I locked myself away and cried for ages. 

That hit me, and hit me hard. She was the one person I had hoped to accept me being third gender, but she didn't. I feel like a broken image of myself. I love her more than anything but I've been having a hard time dealing with just talking to her on the phone and I'm scared she'll leave me if I bring it up again.

I grew up going between the parentally enforced ""girly girl"" phase, and my self-chosen ""tomboy"" phase. I hung out with boys as a child and didn't fit in well with many girls, and then as I got older completely reversed that. In my 22 years of life I feel like I’ve been in a well matched Tennis match and constantly in a volley.
My earliest memory of not really feeling like a girl was around the age of 9. Leading up to this age I had an occurrence here or there of trying to “pee like the boys”, outside and everything. But when I was around 9 I had sat through my first sex ed class and started learning about male and female genitalia. I don’t know if it’s “penis envy” or what but at that point I had wished more than anything that I had been born with a penis. I even tried my best to fashion on out of an old doll bottle and tape, and actually use it to pee… That was an unpleasant, awkward, messy experience. 


Fast forward to the beginning of college. I had come out in high-school as a lesbian, then bi, and then as a lesbian, and then finally as pansexual (My sexuality fluidity is another story that will come up later). I grew into the butchy tomboy look in highschool and really started feeling comfortable dressing in men’s clothes when I started college, but every so often these short lived urges would come over me to dress and appear more feminine. I’d throw on a dress but it would feel like a charade. They made me feel uncomfortable and confining. My wardrobe slowly turned more and more masculine and I started shopping only from the mens section. I started becoming more comfortable with who I was and had the benefit of the reaffirmation from my boyfriend at the time, and that’s when I finally started to delve into my gender confusion. 


I remember all the conversation I had with my boyfriend, “would we be together if I was a guy”, “sometimes I wish I could experience an orgasm from the male perspective”, “Sometimes I wish I was having gay sex with you” were some of the topics and I’ve since come to think about those encounters. A lot of times when I am with men I am wishing I could be with men in a gay way. On the flip side when I am with a women I sometimes wish I could be with her in a typical heterosexual way. And then other times I’m completely fine with the way that I am having sex with them. Honestly I still haven’t figured it out. I use female pronouns and still use my given name, I don’t think I identify as male, and I don’t think I would want to transition to male, though I have been putting a lot of thought into top surgery. I don’t feel like I am one gender. I lean towards the terms androgynous and genderqueer. I just is hard that gender isn’t a binary construct. It’s hard to know how to act and what to do when you don’t fit into either end of the spectrum.

I am: graduating college, starting my first full time job, starting a research project on the side, and changing my name, potentially all in the next week.



My mom (father is out of the picture) is coming into town for the week for the occasion, which will probably be one of two times I see her this year because opposite coasts. She is liberal and openminded, pro-gay rights and all that jazz, but I doubt she knows about anything other  than the general mtf/ftm trans narrative which the media is fond-ish of. 




My family is not good at being close, supportive, or open. Think aspberger and social anxiety stereotypes and you won't be wrong. BUT she and I have actually been developing a mo-dau relationship over the last year or so and I think my coming out may bring us a lot closer. SO IDFK. I strongly think she would be supportive but would not get it at all.

 


This is directly relevant to the name change as she is partially a cause of the name change AND is bringing my birth cert and stuff so I can do it next week. She WILL notice and ask if I do something unexpected like the following.





On the name. I am for sure changing my last name. When my parents split, my mom took her mother's maiden and I stuck w/ my father's for the time being because money, but I want to embrace the family history of the name my mom took (crazy badass), and I hate my father and his name, plus I want to be proud of whatever name I have as Dr. ______.


ON TOP OF WHICH, I am keeping my first name as it is awesome, but am rather torn on my middle. I am genderfluid and have a male name which has seriously stuck over the last 2 or so months. I am strongly considering taking my male name as a middle name to embrace that part of my identity, but I have only had my dude name for a really short amount of time.


It flows s
uper well as (current first)(male)(Marie)(baaaadass last).




Yes of course I can wait a bit to actually do the change, but kinda have to do it in the next couple months so that I can apply to med school and update my passport and id easily.




**Actual input part**
(1) thoughts on using my male name as an extra middle name?
(2) I have only had my male name for a couple months, but it has seriously stuck and I cannot really imagine taking another name, but I cannot help but feel I would be rushing to take my male name when I take my last name because convenience, so thoughts?

I'm distracted and can't focus- plus I just feel shame and disgust towards my body. Mostly that I can't decide even how I identify.

77,2015-05-13 06:34:07,35syym,8,4,"**TL;DR: FAQ to give people when coming out - silly idea? corrections? suggested questions?**

I've been thinking about coming out as non-binary, but there's something that's bothering me about it. For most people I know it'll be a new concept, so I'd end up answering the same questions over and over - or worse, people might make incorrect assumptions instead of asking. Is it a silly idea to prepare a kind of pre-emptive FAQ to give to people upon coming out? I've written one out as an exercise in thought even if I don't end up using it, so please let me know what you think and whether you would add anything to the list.

**Pre-emptive FAQ for coming out**

* What on earth is ""non-binary"" supposed to mean?

It means not identifying within the gender binary of male and female. In my case you can sort of think of it as being halfway transgender. For instance, if I was a transgender man, I would say ""I am not a woman. I am a man"". Since I'm non-binary, only the first part of that statement applies; I'm not a man either. 

* Nobody fits all the stereotypes of their gender; why do you need a word for it?

I absolutely agree that breaking stereotypes doesn't magically make you a different gender. That is not what's behind this. Gender is an innate identity that you don't choose, and when it doesn't align with how other people see and refer to you, that causes some degree of discomfort. More on that in the next bit.

* How long has this been a thing for you?

Ok, bear with me here. If I've sent this to you, you probably know me well enough to be aware that I'm a bit of a pedant when it comes to grammar. One of my pet peeves, as an example, is of people putting an unnecessary apostrophe in ""its"". Now, imagine one day someone wipes from my mind the awareness of the word ""its"" without the apostrophe. From then on, every time people use ""it's"" incorrectly, I get this vague feeling of frustration that they're wrong; an urge to correct them but without anything to correct to. That's what being referred to as female has felt like for as long as I can remember.  
In the last year or so, I've also noticed some physical dysphoria. For those of you that don't know, and somehow have access to this page but not google, physical gender dysphoria refers to the distress trans people (binary and non-binary) feel about their bodies not being how they should be. I'm not currently intending to do anything to help with this other than wear my chest binder, which gives the appearance of a flat chest.

* What should I do?

Honestly, from your point of view not much changes. I'm still exactly the same person and I don't want this to be a big deal. Please just don't refer to me as a woman, and don't freak out if it looks like my boobs are missing - it's just the binder. Pronoun-wise, referring to me as ""they"" (singular form) instead of ""she"" would be ideal, but I understand that it can sound a bit weird or ambiguous in some situations, and takes some getting used to. I'm not going to kill you if you don't.

* So, are you hexadecimal then?

Come on. I *just* said I'm the exact same person. Do you really think I hadn't already thought of that pun? :P

* I have more questions, can I ask them?

Sure. I almost certainly won't mind answering, and if I do I'll just let you know. Keep in mind though that any answers you're looking for can probably be found by googling as well.

* This is all bullshit/You're just a ""special snowflake""/Stop trying to get attention.

Ok, well, that's not a question, but I'll address it anyway in case some people are thinking it.  
Bullshit? I think it's perfectly reasonable. I'm not saying that my gender is mayonnaise here, and the concept of more than 2 genders is not a new thing; it's been around for a long time in many cultures.

'I find it funny how a smile can hide a broken heart,
and how the masking of your feelings is a secret art.

Would you have seen it coming? I know she hides it well;
the whole world is really under this girl's tragic spell.

Thinking nothing of the glare in her big brown eyes;
little do they know, they're a great disguise.

She wakes up, watches the sun rise, starts reeling off the bucket loads of sad lies.

""Are you alright?""
""Yes,"" she replies.

No one can hear the scream of her internal cries.

She thinks there's no hope and no faith left to give.

Feels no reason and no purpose for her soul to live.

Bully. How could you take this girl, and make her feel secure?
Then go grab your mates, and make her feel impure?
'Cause now she's damaged forever and her thoughts are stained;
With every memory you gave her you should be ashamed.

Bully. Did you like it when you heard her screaming out in pain?
I bet the thought of it, is driving the sweet girl insane.
One of the worst crimes that you could commit;
and for what? Just for your own selfish benefit.

And now she's thinking, ""do I even deserve to live?""
'Cause what you did there is no way she could forgive.
She was so innocent, until that event,
You made an indent, on her presence.:(

Now she's forced to travel down her life on this path.
Guess you really didn't think of the aftermath.
Was it intentional?
Are you delusional?
Did you understand what you were doing at all? Bully.
What a waste of such a precious girl I will admit.
You took advantage of her and now you've ruined it.
And I just hope that one day she will recover;
And a genuine smile she will discover.

Sometimes the outside, it don't mean a thing.
'Cause this girl she's beautiful when you start digging in.
And I'll admit that, there's nothing left to say.
But I promise that everything will be okay. Sweet girl.
And just remember that I'm here for you whenever.
It's gonna be that way with us forever.
'Cause you know that I'm never really very far.
And when you see this post, you'll know who you are.

So I hope you cherish the words that I wrote for you. Girl.
And I admire you for everything you've been through.
You are stronger than you'd ever know I promise you,
Just think back at all those awful things, you know it's true.
You're still standing here, healthy and alive,
And if you truly believe I know that you'll survive!'

The neutrois identity calls to me. Gender-neutral. It feels *so right* in a way nothing has ever felt right before. I feel free and clear and like I'm seeing color for the first time. This is *me*.

At the same time, I've been feeling... doubtful about it? Like I don't ""qualify,"" whatever that means.

Objectively, putting aside how I feel and just looking at definitions and thoughts, I thought bigender made more sense.

Today I think it's kind of hit me why. I'm not both a man and a woman. I'm neutral between the two. I am neither, with traits of both, and switching between the two was a way to get as close as possible to my real gender when I didn't believe I could be what I am.

I still kind of... worry about adopting the neutrois label, no matter how right it feels. I worry that my flipping back and forth in that way means I'm not neutral. I worry that I don't know if I want surgery or hormones yet. I worry that there's no space for me. I worry that I don't know how much I want to change my presentation. And because I worry about these things, I police them to try and force myself to be all the things I'm imagining a gender neutral person needs to be. I know I need to stop, I know it's counterproductive, but I'm not quite sure how.

The genderqueer and nonbinary labels aren't *wrong*, but they are very imprecise, and because of that, I feel like calling myself either of them is not *really* expressing my gender in the way calling myself neutrois is. And that's important to me, which is part of why I'm trying to get this all figured out.

101,2015-05-19 01:03:46,36fq75,10,2,"Hello, guys. I'm bipolar and identify as genderfluid (since I will go back and forth between male modes and female modes as well as having times I feel an odd mix of the two or even a lack of the two. It's hard to explain).

I started thinking back on it and realized the fluctuation between genders was a bit similar to my fluctuation between moods (going back and forth between mania and depression as well as becoming hypomanic or almost numb/mixed at times). 

The moods didn't have a direct correlation to my gender mode, as I can be a manic male or a manic female as well as a depressed male or depressed female, so I know the mood cycling and the gender cycling are not in tune with each other. I mention this because for a long time I questioned if it was just my bipolar causing these gender fluctuations, which, of course, made me worry about if those feelings were valid or not.

I started off wondering if they were caused by hormone problems (as starting birth control helped my moods stabilize a bit and I also seemed to have less extreme dysphoria whenever in a male mode (since I'm in a female body)). Because of this, I found that sometimes bipolar's symptoms have been linked to hormonal imbalances! [x](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/attention-please/201310/hormone-imbalance-not-bipolar-disorder) I began to look into if this could affect genderfluidity but seemed to come up with nothing scientifically substantial.

However, it was brought up one day when I was browsing some trans research that the amount of hormones the fetus is exposed to in the womb can possibly be linked to the gender issues one may have later in life. The exposure could change the white matter in the brain, possibly proving that it has a scientific explanation after all! I began looking into how this could possibly link to genderfluidity and found that the thought process of one hemisphere of the brain being more feminine and one hemisphere being more male could contribute to the switching back and forth between genders.

&gt;Finally, our survey found decreased lateralization of handedness in the bigender community. These observations suggest a biologic basis of bigenderism and lead us to propose a novel gender condition, ""alternating gender incongruity"" (AGI). We hypothesize that AGI may be related to an unusual degree or depth of hemispheric switching and corresponding callosal suppression of sex appropriate body maps in parietal cortex- possibly the superior parietal lobule- and its reciprocal connections with the insula and hypothalamus. [x](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22364652)

Those with bipolar disorder have been found to have this same type of hemispheric switching.

&gt;This is based on two lines of reasoning. First, bigender individuals in our survey sample reported an elevated rate of bipolar disorder, which has been linked to slowed hemispheric switching.

Because of this, I have to wonder, are the same things that cause bipolar disorder possibly playing a part in the cause of being bigender/genderfluid? What do you guys think?

Up until then, I lived as a cis gay man. I\'ve been identifying as genderqueer since I was 20 and I\'ve been fine with that label until I try to explain it to other people. I usually say that while my gender is queer, my sexuality and political views are also queer. Being a Barbie Girl in a G.I. Joe world, I find it difficult to explain this to the cis-het people that I come into contact with. They ask if I\'m gay, and I usually just say yes to avoid a long conversation about gender with these people. I\'m curious to know how y\'all tell people that y\'all are queer in a concise and conversational way.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Southern Belle and Radical Queer', 'created': 1432032389.0}"

I was raised in the United States where the vast majority of people are raised with very binary &amp; stereotypical notions of gender &amp; sexuality. (I feel like someone learning Spanish and am probably sounding like an idiot using terms all wrong without realizing it.)

I don't like being ignorant, and I really want to learn &amp; understand. I have noticed that some folks who aren't cisgender get tired of having to ""explain"" themselves, which makes sense to me, so I've tried to be a quiet observer.

I stumbled upon the Robot Hugs comic strip, which has really helped me to get a better understanding, and I even reached out to them to ask questions, but then they posted [this comic](http://www.robot-hugs.com/derail/) and so I decided to just start doing research.

But it's all so very confusing &amp; I wish I could just *talk* to genderqueer people. You learn more from talking to people &amp; immersing yourself in something than reading articles. I watched the Gender 101 video in the sidebar here, but I want to learn more.

When I wanted to learn more about autism, I sought out people who were on the spectrum, and learned directly from them. It was *vastly* more enriching &amp; informative than if I'd just read articles *about* people on the spectrum.

Likewise, by joining minority advocacy groups (I'm white) I've cleared up some ignorances that I never realized I had.

I respect that you folks aren't in some kind of zoo, and this sub doesn't exist for my own personal field-trip &amp; education, so I don't want to be an asshole and wreck your space. At the same time, I feel like that kid who gets picked last for dodgeball &amp; never gets invited to parties.

Hello everyone,

I'm not actually trans* myself (I'm cis-male - if somewhat non-binary; homosexual orientation), but I consider myself an ally of anyone that works hard on finding their identity in a world that is overly fond of labeling us. So, please bear with me, and excuses in advance if I don't speak the lingo. I'll learn quickly, though, and I'd be grateful to be pointed towards more appropriate forms of address if mine is considered inadequate.

My professional background is that of a librarian / anthropologist. Since I have studied shamanic cultures fairly extensively (although mostly Asian ones), I'm well aware of the concept of Two-Spirit people, and the general high regard they traditionally receive among their own people. I also suspect that this is (in North America) tied to their adherence to the medicine societies, since certain aspects of the sacred medicine can only be performed by Two-Spirit people.

What kind of challenges do Two-Spirit people encounter that have abandoned the traditional medicine of their people, and/or have decided to reject the ""box"" they are expected to live in? Although much more respectful than the traditional Anglo approach (ie, berdache), it's still labeling. This would be both in their spiritual life, and in the social ties among their own First Nations kin.

Likewise, I am interested in learning more of First Nations Two-Spirit people's challenges when dealing with the imposed Anglo red-tape when it comes to healthcare and other forms of bureaucracy.

Clarification: I'm specifically looking for Two-Spirit experiences that are fully presenting but not necessarily transitioning, since that was not a traditional thing to seek out.

Thank you all in advance.

So basically here's the best way to put it: Somedays (mostly on weekdays, when I have school and stuff) I feel male, and have absolutely no problem with anything. Then on some weekends (or when I have some free time), I switch to feeling female, and sometimes it lasts maybe a day, an hour, or a whole weekend.

I never feel 100% male or female though. Like, right now I'm in ""female mode"" I guess you could call it, but I only feel 65 - 75% female, and some goes for when I'm in ""male mode"".

My first name is female, but I don't feel it's super feminine. I also have several academic papers published under that name so I'm a little attached to it. The shortened form though, for whatever reason, just doesn't feel right. Maybe 95% of people called me by that nickname, so I decided to post a ""name-change"" announcement on Facebook: 

&gt; IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: I have thought long and hard about this, and I've decided that I will no longer be going by the nickname ""[common nickname of female first name]"". My feelings toward that name have ranged from neutral at best (""I've been called this all my life; I guess it's my name"") to outright hatred (most of you know how much I HATE HATE HATE being called ""[nickname] [last name]"").

&gt; I've been using the nickname ""Tig"" in various places over the past ten years and many people find it fitting and easy to remember once I say ""Tig, like short for tiger or Tigger"". When I get a Real Job™, I will be going by the more professional ""[first initial].[middle initial]."" in the workplace. If neither of these names sound like something you can remember to call me, ""[first name]"" is still my name. But ""[nickname]"" is not. Thanks everyone for your support :)

I didn't expect any backlash, especially since I left my full first name as an option, but I'm a little overwhelmed at the positive response to ""Tig"" as my name. Even my parents are going to start using it! For those who know my whole gender issues package (including my parents) it feels really validating as I assume they know what is up and how I'm moving towards more gender-neutral things, and for my friends and family who don't know yet it feels really good to see them making an effort, and correcting themselves when they call me by my old name, even if I don't realize it before they catch themselves. It gives me hope that they can be so accepting when I come out and possibly change pronouns.

Some highlights from friends I'm not out to:

""It's going to be awful hard not to just call you Tigger.""

I had entertained the idea of assuming the name I used for an online avatar game(which is a real name, not like cosplaykid14 or anything(sorry if that's someone's handle LOL)) but it seemed too cheesy or unoriginal.

158,2015-05-27 21:00:27,37iahw,3,6,"Hey r/genderqueer!

I’m coming out to my dad.
Well, I guess I’ve already come out to him, but he doesn’t quite “get” it.

Luckily, my father is pretty supportive of transgender people. There are quite a few trans women at his church and plenty of gay couples. My deceased mother, the previous minister, counseled plenty of gay &amp; transgender people. Their interim minister is a transman. Neither of my parents really conformed to gender roles. My dad loves “girly” things and my mom loved “manly” things. They were always pretty open about that, and supported me in my gender expression.

What my dad doesn’t get is my desire to transition and identify as not a woman. His excuse is that he knows plenty of women who are very masculine, and that there’s nothing wrong with that. He confuses gender identity with expression and socially constructed gender roles.

The problem is, my father is not really educated on the trans* spectrum. So I need your help.

**First, a little about me:**
AFAB. 25 years old. Transmasculine. 
Still definitely figuring this shit out.
I think I’m more on the “FTM” side of things - but right now i’m happy just to be somewhere in the middle. I like suits and skirts.
I don’t really care for the term “genderqueer” personally, as it conflates gender and sexual orientation in my mind. Androgyne and bi-gender don’t seem to fit either... Anyways, not having the language is certainly difficult. All I’ve really told him is “I don’t feel female... I’m not sure I’m a man, but I know I’m not a woman”.
His response? ""Well, Baylemtree, I don't really see you as a man"" *ouch*

**I need resources to help explain non-binary transgender identity** and why this is important to me for him to change his pronouns around me, and why I’m even doing this. I’m writing him a letter to explain my personal situation and tell him my story. I’m still working out a lot of this with a therapist &amp; my spouse (who is super supportive), and I’m a long way from coming out to the rest of my family, coworkers and friends. However, I want my dad to be informed enough to be a support as I discover more about myself. SO - I need your help in finding resources to help educate him.

He’s an incredibly intelligent and science-y guy though. No tumblr or “Everyday Feminist” articles will do. Ideally, peer-reviewed abstracts would be great, but I’ll settle for what I can get. I want something that explains non-binary gender identity succinctly as well as why non-binary trans people need to transition. He loves academic stuff, but he’s pretty critical of new wave &amp; the SJW brand of feminism (hence why tumblr will not do). 

**Here’s what I’ve compiled so far:**

159,2015-05-27 21:15:08,37icu1,7,10,"I'm afab, and I've never really questioned gender before, as I didn't mean anything to me at all. I was just me. I usually wore neutral clothes. Baggy pants and a loose t-shirt and hoodie. I didn't really realize gender was that important to people, until the last year of college, when I realized that people gave me so much more positive attention and seemed to want to be my friend, when I was wearing girly clothes. I've always had a hard time feeling included, so I jumped on the opportunity of being more of a girl, to feel like I was appreciated and included.

So anyway, I've been dressing girly the last couple of years, but lately I just haven't felt so good doing that. I've just had such a hard time liking myself. I was super close to falling back into an eating disorder again, because I felt so badly about who I am and how I feel like I'll never be good enough. I felt badly about my body, and compared myself to other girls and never really got what was the difference between us. We did the same things, more or less, but they seemed to feel happy about themselves, and I didn't. I just thought it was stress and pressure from work and school that pushed me into some kind of negative spiral, but now I'm not so sure. I used to love dresses and such, but lately eveytime I wore one I just wanted to take it off, because it doesn't feel comfortable anymore...

About a week ago I woke up and realized I don't know how it feels to be a woman. Not for real. And after two days of upset and confused feelings, and nonstop googling, I found the term Genderfluid, and thought ""WHOA!"". I ever only knew about female, male and 50-50 mix of the two. I told my boyfriend that I was having these thoughts, because I thought he should know why I was so distant and preoccupied. I didn't want him to think I was mad at him or anything like that. And afterwards I felt so relieved that I didn't know if I wanted to laugh or cry. So I did both. But after that the feelings have become so strong and weird!

Now I'm just really confused. 

Can i really be genderfluid, or is this just some weird idea that's popped into my head and will disappear soon? 
Is it reasonable to notice this at 22 yrs old? Shouldn't I have known all my life? 
It seems like most GQ people have always known that about themselves..
If it's not a phase, will this get easier over time, or will it always be like this??

I kind of hope It's just a phase, because I feel so shitty about everything. I have changed gender several times a day, and everytime I do I feel uncomfortable and somewhat sad, and I also regret my choice of outfit that day. And everytime I feel like a boy I want to cut my hair off, and wonder how I can conceal my boobs, and then I switch to girl and no longer want to do that stuff. This makes me so sad and confused?? 

Sorry for such a long post. I just don't know where to turn, because I don't know any queer people and I know my friends think these things are weird and that they get annoyed with queer people for making everybody adapt by using a new pronouns for them... So obviously I don't feel safe talking to any of them about what I feel now.

161,2015-05-28 05:31:40,37k4og,5,9,"**The Background**

I identify as bigender.  I'm AMAB and I feel male probably 95% of the time.  And I never feel somewhere in between.  Because I only feel femme maybe one day every month or so, I basically can't do anything for my female identity.  Anything that makes her more comfortable in her own body is exactly wrong the other 95% percent of the time, so net dysphoria goes up.

That means that what I *can* do for my female self mostly centers around clothing, tucking, and maybe some makeup.  Until recently, I lived with people I was not out to, so I had to keep things fairly hidden.

I recently started talking to a friend, a young adult transwoman who has basically resigned herself to never coming out of the closet or transitioning due to family situation and other factors.  She too, would have to hide anything she could have to make things better.

**The Idea**

I've heard about programs that provide care-packages or starter-kits to transpeople who are just coming out.  Things like breast forms and makeup kits and such.  My idea is to do something similar, but rather than targeting people who are about to transition, target people who can't.

Basically, I'm about to send this woman a kit of the things that helps my female side feel good about herself while staying stealth.  I'll list a bunch of examples below.  And now that I'm done making up the shopping list for the kit, I'm thinking ""What if I pooled and bought this stuff in bulk for group discounts?  We can't possibly be the only two people who feel they can't transition but still want to not hate their bodies.""  Because even if transition is your end-goal, you still want to be okay in the meantime.

My question to the group: can you respond in this thread (or in PM to me if you prefer to be more discreet) if you or someone you know might be part of that target audience?  Specifically, if you identify as one gender but have to actively hide that (from parents, roommates, friends, etc) and live as another gender.  And if you're in that demographic, would you mind mentioning items that are easy to hide but also ease your dysphoria or other issues?

-----
**The Kit**

What worked for me and I hope will work for her (and others), is a collection of things that allow me to dress when I'm alone, to a certain degree.  Some of these are things I'm sending and some are ideas I have about what to send next.

* *Panties* - You can wear them under boxers.  Nobody knows the difference, but you can have an anchor.  A feeling of having at least one correctly-gendered garment on you for the day.
* *Stockings* - I know that many ciswomen don't feel the need to remove leg hair, but when you look like me (not going to pass any time in my lifetime), every bit closer to traditional femininity helps.  It's easy for a male-presenting person to always wear shorts that go below the knee.  This means you can shave knee-and-up, and then opaque thigh-highs means you can have a nice visual appearance.
* *Medical Tape and/or NuBra* - I used medical tape.  I literally cried in relief the first time I saw cleavage that was my own real skin.  I hope that she (and others) can have that relief.
* *Gel Bra* - This one isn't specially concealable, but it made me feel much much better.
* *Gaff* - The internet seems convinced that the pantyhose-top construction for a gaff is the best.  So either one of those gaffs or the ingredients for them to assemble their own.
* *Bathrobe* - A big masculine bathrobe.  A really fast way to cover nearly all of your body if you are dressed and get interrupted.
* *Makeup* - Even a basic set, just something they can use to soften.
* *Double-Edge Razor* - The more of you that you shave, the more expensive that gets.  A double-edge seems quintessentially masculine, so it raises no suspicion.  But comparatively the blades are so cheap that you don't have to choose between getting suspiciously-many-refills and using dull blades.",genderqueer,Care Package Idea,1432816300.0,"{'created_utc': 1432791100, 'id': '37k4og', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 9, 'selftext': '**The Background**\n\nI identify as bigender.

I'm an AFAB in the buckle of the bible belt. I identify as transgender/transmasculine. I am not out as of right now, but hope to start T &amp; come out soon...

this leaves me with a bit of a dilemma. I'm pretty active in the feminist community here, specifically the art community. I've been asked to be vice president of a statewide women's art organization. The founders are some of my close friends and mentors, and I have the leadership and institutional knowledge to lead this organization (I have a pretty cool job in the arts, that is well respected).

I love this organization and want to be a part of it. But... how can I be a part of it if I don't identify as female? I don't want to publicly be seen as leading a women's art organization, because I don't want to be identified as female to my social groups.

The easy answer is, of course, that I would come out as trans and resign from the group because my gender does not match that groups gender.

But... gender is also fluid. I'm not a woman, but I'm not strictly a man either. I still wear skirts, and probably can't be fully out due to my job. There have never been any trans*people in this group (as far as I know), and it could lead it to a larger discussion. The president and I have talked about opening FRINGE up to all genders for similar reasons.

Right now, this organization is a safe space for women artists, especially those with children &amp; non-art jobs. I feel like I'm co-opting their space as someone who doesn't identify as female.

Holy crap... is this male priviledge?

172,2015-05-30 16:29:22,37uw9x,4,11,"So I never really identified with having a gender as a child - I was socialised as female and did a lot of typically ""girly"" things but also had times of being really ""boyish"" - and I was a bit of an outsider, not quite one of the girls but not one of the boys either. But I always was treated as a girl, and fit the role a some ways, so I assumed that I was.

When puberty hit, I felt really uncomfortable with my chest - I didn't like the changes and I didn't like the way people treated me or the attention I would get from guys re: my chest. But then when I was still quite young (9/10-12), I experienced some prolonged shittiness which was quite traumatic and related to the ""femininity"" of my body.  I do feel that I would be in denial if I said that that hasn't affected the way I relate to myself. 

I was purposely underweight for a long time and always felt freer and more relaxed in my body at a lower weight - recently I've been making connections and wondering whether that was because it allowed me to look more androgynous. Gaining weight has changed my body a lot and it's been a really powerful experience in terms of reclaiming my body and being visible in society in a way which I was really afraid of. It's led me to question whether my discomfort was ever about weight, and I have realised that I am comfortable in my body at a healthier weight too especially when I can bind. Binding has been helpful and enlightening for me because I really like the way I feel when I bind, and I wake up looking forward to wearing my binder even just for an hour before I go to work (for various reasons, I can't bind at work). Taking it off gives me a feeling of more appreciation for my chest, in a way that I have the choice to bind and so it feels less like a burden - and when I take my binder off then I do feel affection toward my body but I think the affection toward it is because the curves I have remind me of strong women in my life and I appreciate the association of myself with these women and the relationships we have had, and I'm not so sure if it's really about connecting with my own body or with connecting with the feelings I have toward other women, and taking comfort in the sort of societal legacy we share in being read as female and addressing the world from that position. I don't know if that makes any sense?

Basically, I don't know that I feel that I have any gender - though I do have affection for the female gender and the women I relate to irl, and I am appreciative of the ways in which I am ""stereotypically female"" because it has emotional value in terms of how I understand myself and others, and how living in a female role has shaped my life. I'm left wondering, though, just because I like these things, does that mean they are a part of me? Or rather, just because I identify with some stereotypically ""female"" things, do I have to also accept them in that context, or can these things (e.g. my body language, or taking on nurturing roles) be some part of a gender that isn't female? (I think they can. But does that mean that in this case they are separate from my understanding of my gender? Is any of this making sense or in anyway relatable?)

I'm trying to write this all before I go to work so sorry that it's very rambling and probably jumping around. I just feel stressed that I've got all these questions going around my head and no-one that I can feel quite safe enough to ask these things irl. I don't know what qualifies as experiencing oneself as non-binary and while it's a label that I like and that (I think?)

3,2015-05-02 18:38:21,34n9g9,0,1,"Been lurking a bit, commenting here and there, getting my courage up to tell my story. Here goes.

I am biologically male, in my early 40s. I have a string of failed marriages behind me with a few kids scattered amongst them. Ive always battled depression, body image issues, etc. For me, femininity expressions were a fetish, and one I kept pretty private. On the occasions I brought it up to a SO/wife, there was usually a cursory “OK, we can explore that if you want, I guess” but never any follow through. In hindsight, not being able to be myself probably contributed to my distance or questionable decisions that led to those relationships imploding. I briefly questioned what my sexuality was and decided I was not attracted to men, even though some of what I felt throughout my adult life made me feel I ought to be. (I have realized I am strongly attracted to feminine features/body types but genitals are irrelevant to me).

But that changed when things got serious with my new partner. She identifies as genderfluid, biologically female. She embraced my “fetish” immediately, and she knew there was more to it. She helped me realize that I am not just one gender. I guess genderfluid is one label that applies to me (so many labels we have to choose from! I can’t keep track of them all!) but I also think of myself as trans, because I know I want to go through some sort of transition to get where I want to be, to where I feel I am inside. Sometimes I feel more masculine and sometimes more feminine. For now, we think of and talk of my “feminine side” as a distinct personality, but it’s mostly to make sense of the different ways I feel at times and having a name/label for both aspects of me is convenient.

We have bought me clothes and I dress when we can have privacy together (toddlers make that hard, and I’m still coming to terms with who I am myself, not ready to broach it with others, plus I have NO IDEA how the exes will take it and am not ready for that possible fight). I’m getting ready to come out to a few different friends who I know will be supportive but other than this this is my first real “coming out”.

Transition will be complicated for me if possible at all due to a serious health condition that may be terminal. We’ll see. For now, I’m focusing on finding out who I am and ways to express that. I definitely have body dysphoria issues but am comfortable with my genitals. I want to thank everyone here who has shared their stories because seeing people who share my issues has already helped me immensely. I share my own story to maybe offer the same to someone else and to ask for support/insight from anyone willing to offer. Y’all are great. Thanks.

I briefly questioned what my sexuality was and decided I was not attracted to men, even though some of what I felt throughout my adult life made me feel I ought to be. (I have realized I am strongly attracted to feminine features/body types but genitals are irrelevant to me).\n\nBut that changed when things got serious with my new partner. She identifies as genderfluid, biologically female. She embraced my “fetish” immediately, and she knew there was more to it. She helped me realize that I am not just one gender. I guess genderfluid is one label that applies to me (so many labels we have to choose from! I can’t keep track of them all!) but I also think of myself as trans, because I know I want to go through some sort of transition to get where I want to be, to where I feel I am inside. Sometimes I feel more masculine and sometimes more feminine. For now, we think of and talk of my “feminine side” as a distinct personality, but it’s mostly to make sense of the different ways I feel at times and having a name/label for both aspects of me is convenient.\n\nWe have bought me clothes and I dress when we can have privacy together (toddlers make that hard, and I’m still coming to terms with who I am myself, not ready to broach it with others, plus I have NO IDEA how the exes will take it and am not ready for that possible fight). I’m getting ready to come out to a few different friends who I know will be supportive but other than this this is my first real “coming out”.\n\nTransition will be complicated for me if possible at all due to a serious health condition that may be terminal. We’ll see. For now, I’m focusing on finding out who I am and ways to express that. I definitely have body dysphoria issues but am comfortable with my genitals. I want to thank everyone here who has shared their stories because seeing people who share my issues has already helped me immensely. I share my own story to maybe offer the same to someone else and to ask for support/insight from anyone willing to offer. Y’all are great. Thanks.\n\nTl;dr- Hi. I’m like you.

cismale here!  I like this community and the ideas and expressions it represents.  I hope I am not being insensitive in any way, I just wanted to get some thoughts on my idea and facilitate discussion. I apologize in advance if I step on some toes!

Pronouns are an issue aren't they?  Especially for you folks.  Hell, even for me.  I don't FEEL like a MAN.  I barely look like one.  I'm scrawny, long haired, and I have the bare chest of an infant.  What pronouns exist in the English language that describe me?  Do any accurately describe you?  Maybe? A little?  I have no idea this is a huge stab in the dark for me, but I was talking with my good friend about this whole situation and how she has to be PC at work for her customers.  Good on her asking pronouns is the right thing to do!  It should be as easy as asking a name,  I mean how often we use them they might as well be our names.

HE SHE IT WE YOU THEY?

That is some seriously limited bullshit.  IDK MY BFF JILL about this shit, but it is a little annoying that we haven't updated that.  I'm not calling for a revolution, and I'm not saying my idea is a good one.  I just like to talk about language and have fun.  What if life was like the internet, and you went by a handle.

11,2015-05-05 07:10:16,34x1b3,0,1,"I'm a 17 year and 7 month old, physically male, genderfluid person. I have nobody to go to about any of my worries about all of this (that can give me advice at least) and I was thinking maybe all of you could help.

To begin, I guess, I was kicked out of where my mother lived 8 months ago because I was a problem for her due to all of my mental health issues. I was lucky enough to have my dad take me in because he felt bad about almost never being in my life until I was about 14 and he wanted to get to know me. He seemed friendly enough and I went with it. I started working and obtained my GED.

To get into the gender stuff, I've always felt that I should have been a female but liked my male form. I was always into girly stuff a lot more than boyish stuff and later on in my short life would regularly try on my older sister's clothes and makeup in secret because I felt like if I was caught by anyone I would get in trouble because I was already bullied constantly by my peers and family for being girly. I ended up hiding away a lot of my girlier tendencies until I was about 14 and I met my best friend who was completely okay with everything I was and I got to be all of me with her.

I've recently tried to come out about my bisexuality with my mom (I'm still in contact with her and see her regularly because even though she's kicked me out she still wants to have a relationship and I need her for insurance reasons) and dad. My dad took it surprisingly well. He literally said ""okay"" and we both just carried on like nothing. My mom on the other hand tried to convince me I'm delusional and that it's a phase even though I've felt really attracted to both males and females since I was about 9 or 10 years old and had silly little flings with both males and females in 8th grade and my freshman year of high school (in secret of course).

The reason my bisexuality is relevant to all of this is because I feel so very trapped in having to act completely masculine almost 24/7. I just want to be able to go completely crazy with all of my feminine things but I simply can't do that because I can't really risk my mom just completely disowning me (I'm assuming her reaction would be worse than my coming out) and even though my dad's reaction to my coming out was perfect he's shown a lot of hate for transgenders because of the whole Bruce Jenner interview and I can't risk him disowning me because then I wouldn't have anywhere to live (I've only been working about a month and a half and have nowhere near enough income to find a place of my own where I live). He's even shown a lot of hate towards me doing little girly things like painting my toenails and elaborately styling my long hair when I'm just at home. I did those things because I felt okay enough with him to show a little bit of that since he took my coming out well but I quickly stopped once he told me to stop acting like a girl.

It's honestly killing me. I've tied quite a few nooses and held a lot of knives to my throat but I've somehow not done anything. I'm having a much harder time finding the strength to not follow through with anything though. I can't take hiding myself anymore.

Yesterday morning something in my brain snapped. I had to get it out. He was at work and so I sent a long rambely email. Explaining what I could and giving resources to better explain other things. I sat nervously for the rest of the day. Refreshing my email. Hoping for a reply. Knowing in the back of my mind that it was going to be okay, but still being so scared. What if it wasn't? My SO is a white cis-male, and though an accepting person was raised in rural-white-bead-christian-conservative land and didn't know a whole lot about the lgbt+ community until my ass somehow landed itself half way across the country from my home town to this strange rural land. He was just beginning to wrap his head around the trans* community, was it going to push him too far to bring it into our own home? I tried to tell myself that he always appreciated my masculine side anyway ""like my best guyfriend, but with boobs!"" and for a straight guy he is very open in the bedroom as well. ""Doesn't matter who you are or what you believe, the fact is if you stimulate a man's prostate right he's gonna like it..."" So pegging had already been long introduced into our play. But the doubt was there nonetheless. 

When he finally got home, the first thing he did was hug me and apologize for not replying to my email, because by the time he read through it all he actually had to work. And he reminded me, like he often does, that no matter what he still loves me. 

He held me while I sobbed, and like he's so good at, started annoying the hell out of me to try and cheer me up. Poking at me until I was forced to smile. Asking silly questions like ""so can I call you bro now?"" and ""I can still shout 'woman!' at you right? because whether you're a guy or girl you're still a total house wife you know that right?...but really if you don't want me to of course I'll work on it."" ""Am I going to have to get you a red coat?"" (I'm a big Outlander fan, and SO is a Scott, who wears his kilt on the regular. There's a red coat officer in the series who's obsessively in lust with the main character, who many people describe my SO to look exactly like.) 

After much teasing and prodding and poking, he kissed me deeply and held me closely, before asking if after we made dinner if I wanted to go on a nice long hike back to his family's private camp site to have some privacy to let my primal masculine instinct out in the woods. ""You've got good timing coming out, I've been craving you inside me anyway."" We packed a bag with blankets and toys, and headed into the woods so I could peg him with nothing but the sounds of us and the stream and the wind through the trees. 

We laid there for some time after, naked in the middle of the woods until we got to chilly to stay still and got up and hiked out way back out. We took the long, scenic drive back. Stopping to admire the scenery here and there. We swung by the general store in town and he bought some snacks for me, took me home and I read and ate while he showed my different games he'd like us to play together. Shortly after we crawled into bed for the night, taking each other once more before we fell asleep.

57,2015-05-30 01:26:00,37skvv,9,6,"So hi everyone, I'm a newbie here. Basic info, I guess? Mid-20s AFAB genderfluid human who uses mostly she pronouns but is contemplating they pronouns. My gender usually slides between female and neutral, but I've had a couple days' worth of very strong boy feelings recently, so that's... that's new. Anywhos! Nice to meet you and such! On to my topics of discussion. **This is gonna get kinda long, my apologies.**

First off, I am short and fat. I have curves, squish, stretch marks, and a, shall we say, considerable bust. And housing that bust is a problem. Can't find bras that fit right in stores, and the size that's closest to fitting only comes in one style and like two colors where I shop. Last time I measured, the total all the way around the fullest part of my bust was somewhere in the 50-inches range.

That makes me really, REALLY worry about shopping for binders. I'm absolutely clueless about binder shopping, and I worry about the cost of a binder versus the risk that comes with not being able to try it before I buy it. I'm not sure there's any way to get me flat, really. But that's not the only problem.

I have some sensory issues with my breasts. When I become aware of my breasts touching each other, or touching the parts of my chest that get covered by underboob, it feels physically wrong, viscerally disgusting, and gives me severe nope. I have been scared away from the idea of binding for almost a year now because I've been so afraid that rather than helping me feel better about myself, binding would only make it worse by smashing those monsters even more into my chest, causing even more contact-nope than before. And if that happened, I know I would be collassally screwed, and I don't know if I could handle that.

So, I guess I have some questions, and they would be thus:

* How does a person with my kind of a bust go about finding the right binder? How does flattening a 50+ inch chest work?
* What should I be prepared for in terms of how binding feels? (Bustier folks' answers very much appreciated!!)
* Are there other people out there with sensory issues who bind, and if so, how do y'all cope with that?
