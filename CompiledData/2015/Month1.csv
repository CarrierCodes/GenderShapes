I personally think it's short-sighted and not really in place with it's consumers' best interests in mind and go on about why and what can possibly be done about it [here](http://uniquelyevil.tumblr.com/post/108203265109/facebook-will-have-blood-on-its-hands-if-it).

And before anyone goes on about 'Oh! Well if you don't like it don't sign up for Facebook/leave Facebook!'

It's their site.
Yeah.
But are you paying attention to people's reasoning?
Just because they produced something doesn't mean they're above critique, feedback, criticism, and change. Especially when it's something that's potentially endangering people and they don't even take the time or effort to handle these things on a case-by-case basis.
It's one thing to tell people not to sign up for FB, but for those who have been using it for years it's not that easy to just walk away from all of your relationships and groups. And it's definitely fucked up to just cut them off from all their contacts and pretty much tell them they can't have access to any of them until they do as you tell them. And the whole government ID thing? That's bullshit. They have no right asking people for that if they're not making some sort of purchase. People shouldn't have to make that decision. It's a stupid policy that needs to change already.
Not to mention this policy makes it easy for people to be [targeted](http://realnamepolice.tumblr.com/) by people who seem to have no hobbies. 

If you have any other ideas or resources that would be helpful with this effort please let me know!!

And if not, simply spreading the word, signing the petition and letting Facebook know how you feel would be more than enough! Thank you!

40,2015-01-28 12:24:14,2tyfq4,1,5,"I feel I'm at an impasse.  I'm broke, I'm jobless, I'm 28, and I'm about to lose my apartment, and all that just makes this so much worse.  I've wanted to be a girl for as long as I can remember.  I remember being 2 or 3 and my mom was cutting my hair.  She was real rough when she did that and it hurt and I was cold and I started to complain.  Her reaction was to ask me if I wanted to be a girl, as if it were a bad thing.  I said no, but even then, I wanted to say yes.  


At night, I used to pretend that me and my stuffed animals were a family and while I was ""Daddy"" occassionally, more often than not, I would be ""Mommy.""  I've known this whole time and yet, this whole time, I've been completely in the closet, hoping it would just go away.  My first time dressing as a girl, I was 4 years old.  I found that I liked it and for many nights thereafter, my mother would put me to bed and she would go watch TV in the living room.  I would then creep out of bed, go into her room, and find something I thought looked pretty and pretend I was a pretty lady at a dinner party or some such like that.  Then one night, she caught me.  She hit me and yelled as she made me strip out of her clothes and back into my pajamas and the next day, punished me by taking away privileges, for a week or a month, I don't remember, never again mentioning what had transpired the night before.  She kind of acted like she was doing me a favor that next day.  She never again mentioned that incidence, nor did she ever catch me again, but here and there, as I got older, she would make comments like ""oh, I wouldn't mind if you were gay but if you were transgender, I would be heartbroken.""  She would give different reasons for her heartbrokenness when the topic would come up, sometimes saying that life would be much harder for me as a transgirl than as a gay man.  


Not that I ever came out as gay, or ever even really thought of myself as gay.  As a man, I like women.  I sometimes feel as though my relations with women have been a way for me to live as a girl vicariously.  I have, however, had fantasies, many fantasies, of myself being a girl with a man, but never as a man with another man.  I used to tell myself that my sexual fantasies involving men and me as a girl, they were just a fetish.  That I could never *really love* a man.  But maybe I could.  I've had quite a few nonsexual fantasies involving myself as a girl with a man, more and more as the years have dragged on.  


My mother's scolding that night when I was a little boy who only wanted to be a little girl, of course, did nothing to help rid me of the desire to be pretty and girly but I think the effects of that night, as well as the way my mother and my peers referred to trans individuals, have probably helped a lot to keep these desires tucked far away all these years.  I can't fight the urge to dress up here and there--to at least feel a little like a woman, at least some of the time, but I've never come out to anyone, other than a few select strangers on the internet who I'd talk to once, maybe 2 or 3 times, and then never again.  I've never told a friend, a loved one, a girlfriend, nobody.  And now I'm getting older and broker and homelesser and I try to be hopeful.  I'll get a call about a job tomorrow, I tell myself, but even if I do, then what?  I'm still a boy.  


It's taken me a long time and I have to admit, sometimes I do still feel a tinge of shame when the desire seems to get too great, but the desire seems to come more and more often, and more and more, I feel like nothing I do from here on out matters that much because, as long as I have to be a boy, as long as I don't have the support that would enable me to enter a life of femininity, I'm not really myself.  I still feel the shame sometimes, though I know there is nothing to be ashamed about.  Of the few friends and loved ones I have left, I don't think any of them would have issue if I were to come out but I'm still not ready for that.  I need someone who at least somewhat understands what this is like.  I need someone to gain guidance from.  


I'm not just too broke, but too scared, too beaten and broken to embrace my femininity on my own.  I've tried a couple times in the past (online) but mostly I've just come across creeps, flakes, and jerks, and after a while, I just kind of gave up.  But as times have gotten worse for me in other areas of my life, the desire just comes back that much stronger.  My ideal situation?  My prince charming comes along, says ""hey, I know you're going through some rough times and I just want to help.  I'll buy you some clothes, help you with your makeup, give you a place to crash, and help you ease into this life as comfortably as possible.  Oh, and you know what?  I know of a trans-friendly business who's looking for some extra help and I can help you get an interview for next week so while we're at it, let's get you an interview outfit.""  Ideal circumstance.  I know that probably won't ever happen and maybe I won't even ever work up the courage to take the steps I need to to come out or embrace such a life.  Posting here, I guess the best I can hope for is a kind voice, a kind ear.  Venting helps when all else fails.  


I see girls when I go out, on the train, at my school, in stores and on the streets and I just want to be them so bad.  I want to dress like them, I want to walk like them, talk like them, move like them, and do girly things.  I see the way other guys look at them and I wish more so bad that a man would look at me like that, with me looking like she does.  I want it to stop more than I want to embrace it, but after almost three decades, I'm starting to realize that it won't stop until I'm dead.  Sometimes though, when I'm overly tired or my neurons are aligned just right, I'll be on my way home and I'll get it in my head that ""tonight, I'm gonna figure it out and I'm gonna go for it!""  Then I get home and use the bathroom and as I wash my hands, I see my face in the mirror and see that it's already matured into a somewhat manly shape.  And I have a slight Adam's apple.  And I have nice legs but my hands.  They're all big and veiny and oh, I could never be a woman.  And then I lose momentum and I'm sad until I go to sleep.  Then I wake up and look in the mirror and think to myself ""maybe I could pull it off, but better to not even try.  Mom was right.  It would be a hard life and life is hard enough as it is,"" and I push the thoughts, the feelings, the desires, I push all of it down as far as it will go but it always bounces back hard a few weeks later, a few days later.  


The world is harsh to us (and I don't mean just trans individuals, but everybody, in one way or another, but still, especially those who struggle with something like gender dysphoria, and, as the coward I am, I can't even begin to fathom the struggles of those who have embraced their dysphoria), but even moreso, we are harsh to ourselves.  I'm harsh to myself.  I've had thoughts of suicide throughout the years, almost attempted with pills a few years ago (threw them up immediately after ingesting).  I've had a hard life all around but sometimes I catch myself thinking ""if I could just have, at some point, rid myself of this shameful secret, this curse, would I have ever considered attempting suicide?  Would life have been as hard?""  


Sometimes, though, I wonder what my life would have been like had I been able to come out when I was younger.  Better maybe.  I would have built a base of friends within the trans community, and without, get a job writing for a magazine or periodical with a focus on trans issues or maybe get a job at a trans book store, meet a caring, sweet, and gentle man whom I loved and who loved me, save up money, freeze some sperm (so I could be a mommy!), and start on HRT, and somewhere throughout, go to school as a girl, be able to feel like a woman as I bought a squash and a roast beef to cook for dinner or just nail polish and cough medicine at the drug store or as I rode the bus home or as I rode the train to work.  Maybe it would have been just like that--a fairy tale.  Or maybe I'd have just had to deal with more shit and my mentality might have just stayed the same.  I'll never know what my life could have been like and maybe I won't ever know.  Maybe I should see a therapist.  Either way, I just wanted to get some of this off my chest.  Wasn't sure where exactly to post this but this sub seemed like a good enough place.

I know of a trans-friendly business who\'s looking for some extra help and I can help you get an interview for next week so while we\'re at it, let\'s get you an interview outfit.""  Ideal circumstance.  I know that probably won\'t ever happen and maybe I won\'t even ever work up the courage to take the steps I need to to come out or embrace such a life.  Posting here, I guess the best I can hope for is a kind voice, a kind ear.  Venting helps when all else fails.  \n\n\nI see girls when I go out, on the train, at my school, in stores and on the streets and I just want to be them so bad.  I want to dress like them, I want to walk like them, talk like them, move like them, and do girly things.  I see the way other guys look at them and I wish more so bad that a man would look at me like that, with me looking like she does.  I want it to stop more than I want to embrace it, but after almost three decades, I\'m starting to realize that it won\'t stop until I\'m dead.  Sometimes though, when I\'m overly tired or my neurons are aligned just right, I\'ll be on my way home and I\'ll get it in my head that ""tonight, I\'m gonna figure it out and I\'m gonna go for it!""  Then I get home and use the bathroom and as I wash my hands, I see my face in the mirror and see that it\'s already matured into a somewhat manly shape.  And I have a slight Adam\'s apple.  And I have nice legs but my hands.  They\'re all big and veiny and oh, I could never be a woman.  And then I lose momentum and I\'m sad until I go to sleep.  Then I wake up and look in the mirror and think to myself ""maybe I could pull it off, but better to not even try.  Mom was right.  It would be a hard life and life is hard enough as it is,"" and I push the thoughts, the feelings, the desires, I push all of it down as far as it will go but it always bounces back hard a few weeks later, a few days later.  \n\n\nThe world is harsh to us (and I don\'t mean just trans individuals, but everybody, in one way or another, but still, especially those who struggle with something like gender dysphoria, and, as the coward I am, I can\'t even begin to fathom the struggles of those who have embraced their dysphoria), but even moreso, we are harsh to ourselves.  I\'m harsh to myself.  I\'ve had thoughts of suicide throughout the years, almost attempted with pills a few years ago (threw them up immediately after ingesting).  I\'ve had a hard life all around but sometimes I catch myself thinking ""if I could just have, at some point, rid myself of this shameful secret, this curse, would I have ever considered attempting suicide?  Would life have been as hard?""  \n\n\nSometimes, though, I wonder what my life would have been like had I been able to come out when I was younger.  Better maybe.  I would have built a base of friends within the trans community, and without, get a job writing for a magazine or periodical with a focus on trans issues or maybe get a job at a trans book store, meet a caring, sweet, and gentle man whom I loved and who loved me, save up money, freeze some sperm (so I could be a mommy!), and start on HRT, and somewhere throughout, go to school as a girl, be able to feel like a woman as I bought a squash and a roast beef to cook for dinner or just nail polish and cough medicine at the drug store or as I rode the bus home or as I rode the train to work.  Maybe it would have been just like that--a fairy tale.  Or maybe I\'d have just had to deal with more shit and my mentality might have just stayed the same.  I\'ll never know what my life could have been like and maybe I won\'t ever know.  Maybe I should see a therapist.  Either way, I just wanted to get some of this off my chest.  Wasn\'t sure where exactly to post this but this sub seemed like a good enough place.

45,2015-01-31 02:16:17,2u9kc8,3,6,"tl;dr at the TOP!: if anyone just has some ideas for coming out to my parents, that'd be swell.

The actual post:



So I actually started a post before doing a bunch of computer related shenanigans and closed chrome (with the in progress post).

Totally forgot cause I usually use Firefox and hey, what could chrome be running for right now, yeah? (Dumb)

So...

Okay, I'm 19.
19 and like 3 months-ish. I'm a guy, or at least that's what everyone tells me. (Except for my friends who joke about my long hair and call me a woman.. which both irks and doesn't irk me causeeeee..)

Okay so since I was about 12 or 10, y'know something around there-- (My memory is absolute garbage pardon, also lots of parenthesis with me going blah and stuff and words, sorry about that too)

-- I realized I wanted to be a girl. Or at least felt that way. At the time I was well versed in the use of the internet due to having one in the house for quite a while.

At the time I was pretty religious, mostly cause it was kinda shoved into my head by my parents (or at least mother) and prayed pretty daily. So I often.. prayed for some changes.

Obviously that did absolute diddly. I've long since abandoned religion (which is unrelated! but y'know it's a thing).

So for long as I could remember I've hated getting haircuts too. Parents say I kicked and fought when I was even younger than I can remember about them as well.

But well, didn't really have a choice for quite a while. Once high school started I got to keep it a little longer but the school itself was against boys having long hair and so... yeah.

Actually I got pretty horribly emotional over having to cut my hair near the end of senior year and just didn't know why.

When I was 10-12, something (sorry that this story is absolutely everywhere) made me google up body altering sorts of things. I was young, I believed in magic. 
I quickly stopped believing in magic once the internet threw proof at me. Good internet, teaching kids to not be dumb.

Annnnnyway.

Some combination of search keywords later and I ended up at a... transgender webcomic.

And I was absolutely confused.

Google against assisted in defining transgender.
And I was...  well, relieved. I think I understood what was up with me.


Let's fast forward to the present and stay there. (because the god awful memory does not lend itself to clear stories)

So for the past couple of months I've been in a serious rut.
I dunno why.

Well maybe I do, bad relationship, that could be why!
I told one of my best friends, who I've known for years (let's call him Ross) that I was bi (well really pan but explaining why I have a love of cookware just would be awkward jkbadjokeseverywhere) and trans.

And y'know, he seemed cool about it. (also the first person I ever told that I actually knew, not including random internet strangers that literally can't figure out who I am and therefore I felt safe at the time)
And then he totally changed his lifestyle, threw all of my secrets at my girlfriend of about 2 weeks... which ruined a lot.

Not at first, she seemed... okay with knowing everything (not that I wanted someone I just basically got close to to know absolutely EVERYTHING ABOUT MY LIFEanwaysorry..)
Ended up breaking up in part because of the whole.. trans thing. She thought it was something that could be cured, or that I could forget about (y'know technically I did for quite a while so maybe she's right..)

Anyway.

Lately I've been confrontational with my dad. I yell at him a lot for no reason (and promptly apologize because what the hell am I doing).

I don't really feel much of anything anymore.
Did share that in addition to being bi (explaining pan to a parent is probably less difficult than trans, but still), he seemed to think I was depressed (but took the bi thing pretty well!) and I kinda think i agree with him.

I'm really blank. I dunno.
Also dysphoria is actually becoming a problem. I realized that I've basically just been running on instinct and not thinking about anything at all. Which is probably why I was able to push aside the trans thing, I thought I had time. I mean I knew the earlier you transition the better to like offset ""natural"" puberty and all that jazz, but still... y'know, time.

I'm 19 now.
I've said that, and I realize I'm running out of time for a ""successful"" transition.
While I've previously said I don't really feel anymore, I just kinda.. know I'm fed up with all the pretending. I despise the stupid beard that gives away in like .1 seconds that I'm a guy. My hair's quite long now because... college, no one can tell me what to do in that regard anymore. Kinda feel like I could pass if I could just like train my voice (been trying, no success. as it stands my normal speaking voice is kinda odd too really so hey maybe it's a personal problem) and make the beard GTFO. (shaving sucks for me, I bleed a lot, oh well dx)


Anyway..

I want to come out to my parents. I need help with the actual transitioning and well.. parents are supposed to be supportive, right?

I mean my dad's actually really amazing and I hate myself for being such a dick when I was younger to him. He'd probably help if he took it well..

My mom's an absolute religious nut. While I love her, I highly doubt she'd accept me.


To anyone who's gonna say ""move out and do it yourself!""
I've thought about it.
I've got a job, however it's part time because college and I can barely manage to keep my grades together with the rediculous amount of sleep I get (2 hours a night for the previous semester), trying to get more but still.

Also I'm from fairly big city, and everything is expensive. 
So from healthcare (I have none, still on the parents plan and that is a blessing if I ever did see one) to school to... transitioning. I don't think I can do it on my own.

Not for a while.

And I want to get this done before it's gonna be half assed.

Not saying people having had successful transitions in their later years, I've seen a lot and you guys are absolutely amazing. (also when I say guys it's like the general ""all you guys"" sorta thing I don't mean you're all dudes sorry sorry words)

I just uh, I don't know if I can wait.
I mean I could but.


I'm a mess. I accept that.
I don't talk to people much about anything or my feelings(hah what feelings) or how I think but..

This is I guess the balancing out. Tell the internet! Try to get some help, ey?

So if anyone could give me ideas to coming out to my parents (or at least my dad) that'd be.. fantastic.

Or, if you'd like to talk about anything else, feel free to say.. anything else. Really I'm uh... I think I'm lonely.

Also this is a throwaway and the most interesting thing you'll find in my profile is... this post. And any subsequent replies. I think. Yes.

8,2015-01-03 05:45:05,2r6h20,6,4,"Hello! I've been thinking about gender a lot lately, but I feel like I need some outside help. I'm AFAB, probably not cis, maybe transman?, but probably genderqueer. For instance, I like wearing short shorts but I'd prefer not to have breasts. Here's where the trouble comes in. When you take into account that men can wear short shorts and still identify as men, etc etc, it gets very confusing for me. Does this mean I'm just cis and self-conscious? Transman who likes short-shorts? Genderqueer????? If anyone has some sort of answer for this, I'd really appreciate it. 

Aaand now onto less theoretical stuff. Basically, I want to experiment, but I'm not sure how. I have a ridiculously round face with a square jaw, and there's no mistaking me as anything but female despite my broad shoulders. I want to look nice. Pretty?? Attractive? I don't know. Right now I wear t-shirts and shorts but I'd really like to be well-dressed. How can I dress androgynously and still look good? How far can I stray into the men/women's aisles? I would never wear a dress, but short shorts and some womens' pants are awesome. I really like mens' tops. Can I just combine the two, or would it look bad? 

As for pronouns...how do I introduce this to my friends? I'm thinking of starting with they/them and branching off from there. I don't really want to come out exactly...so how would I ask them? Does experimenting with pronouns really help all that much? 

Back to looks (I guess). I'd really like to bind. In your experience, do people ever really notice? I'd be doing it for myself, and I don't want to come out yet. I don't feel comfortable even saying 'I'm not cis'. Also, are there any good, flattering haircuts for round faces that also manage to look androgynous?

Sorry for all of the questions. I'm just very confused. I figure I should mention that I'm 16 - so still under my parents' roof. How do I confront that issue if they bring up my new clothing/haircut?

I recently saw something that kind of reassured me - ""If you spend a lot of time questioning your gender, you're probably not cis."" I'm a teenager, so this being a whim kind of worries me...would you say that's generally true?

Okay, I'm done now. Thank you so much for reading all the way through!

9,2015-01-03 06:53:56,2r6n4b,8,6,"Long time lurker, first time poster, so hello. 

I'm quite shy, so it feels a bit unnatural to draw attention to myself with a story as I'm about to tell, but this subreddit seems so filled with kind and awesome folks that I decided it was time for an introduction of sorts. I'm AFAB, 23 years old, and never really thought of myself as any sort of queer until recently, when my queerness was called into question. 

I grew up quite the gender-nonconforming person, a little girl who loved dresses but only cared about bugs, dirt, and dinosaurs, and at age 8 cut her hair and started dressing as and wanting more than anything to be a boy, a stage in my life that lasted for about two years. Due to the pressure and confusion of adolescence and middle school, I started presenting more femininely for a time, but then reverted to more of a butch style by a year later. I think it was around that time I acknowledged that I was a girl, but with a little bit of boy mixed in, which was a mindset I stuck with until recently. I never had a problem with female pronouns or being called a girl, but my identity was always more of ""I'm a *different* kind of girl."" Thinking back at it now, I identified most strongly as female when in ""women in science"" discussions, but other than that, I couldn't really stand the societal expectations and stereotypes of women, because none of them fit me, and I never felt strongly attached to being female. None of this ever caused much tension, though, because society generally is accepting of tomboys or more masculine girls, and I was asexual at the time, so attraction and dating hadn't happened for me yet.

Fast-forward to a couple months ago. I work as a math tutor in a center located in a very affluent and conservative city, and one day received a call from one of my bosses that a parent had unusually specific complaints about the way I was dressing, including my Dc. Martens and blue hair (serious wtfs). Now, I am lucky to work under the people I do, as they had no complaints over my attire (casual dress code for tutors) and permitted me to have unnaturally-colored hair, so they were a bit bewildered as well, and told me just to be mindful of our very conservative clientele. I took it with a grain of salt, or I told myself I did. It actually hit me like a shit ton of bricks. It was then I realized how much pride I took in dressing androgynously, when I had to change out of cargo shorts and into an outfit I thought rich, conservative, private-schooled kids' parents would approve of. I wore some sort of blousey shirt and skinny pants, which felt too feminine and downright uncomfortable. 

After that, I struggled each day after that trying to decide what was appropriate, but not so much ""appropriate,"" really, when I thought about it. I was worried about what the complaints would be next. Am I queer? What if a parent or student realized I'm queer? How could I defend myself when this may actually be a problem for the people I serve? Being called out, even when I wasn't supposed to take it personally, became a very personal struggle of what being queer meant to me which I hadn't exactly breached before. It was never an issue at my very liberal college, with my friends, or with my bisexual boyfriend -- it never came up, it just *was*. I'm not even sure if I outright thought of myself as queer. My friends and I all acknowledged that sexuality and gender expression were vast oceans and not binaries. People were just people. I identified as just me, not really a specific gender, and not really straight. After the complaints, I realized I was definitely uncomfortable with cis-het, but didn't at first feel worthy of calling myself queer because I went so long without anything being a problem. ""Genderqueer"" was a new term to me I only had learned in the past year, but I lay in bed one night and noticed how it spoke to me, and how other genderqueer people's stories and experiences seemed so similar to my own. Both reading stories on the interwebs and talking to friends helped me validate the part of my identity I'd never bothered to slap a word onto. 

I'm feeling much better now, and after the shock wore off and I talked briefly with my bosses again, I don't worry as much about what I wear to work. (Unfortunately I can't wear ties (my favorite!) since it's casual, but oh well.) It feels so silly that there were several weeks where the issue of clothes was a tumultuous one, but realizing that my gender identity/presentation may actually be a problem to the people I interact with on a daily basis left me feeling slightly threatened. Of course that's all sorts of not okay, but I'd imagine gender expression in the workplace can be quite an issue for some genderqueer folks, even much more so than it was for me. It was such a relief to find genderqueer communities online so that I could know I wasn't alone in my feelings.

Sorry for the lengthy brainspew. I just hoped to share details so that others may relate. And feel free to share experiences, as I'd love to get to know some of you.

I met with a friend who does a lot of work in the community and spilled what I could. I was really anxious even though I knew he wouldn't judge me.

25,2015-01-04 23:11:34,2rcdce,33,10,"GeeQs and gamers, it has come to my attention that there are a few Dungeons &amp; Dragons players among r/genderqueer and so I propose that maybe we can start a play-by-post game in a related subreddit. 

&gt;You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances.  Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could become a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface.
&gt;You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphrodite, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's image. You could play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide. 
&gt;~D&amp;D 5th edition Player's Handbook, p121

Dierolls can be handled using /r/rollme. Shareable character sheets can be found at mythweavers.com. The usefulness of a play-by-post game is that it can accommodate players who might not be able to gather at the same time, be it across different timezones or problematic schedules.

I would be glad to offer my services as a Dungeon Master. I've been playing D&amp;D since 1996 and have experience with each edition from 2nd to 5th. I would recommend the 5th edition in particular for play-by-post since it doesn't rely as strongly on maps and grids for combat and combats are rather speedy in general. I have years of experience running play-by-post games.

26,2015-01-05 00:14:13,2rck8h,24,4,"Throwaway because I'm embarrassed. I'm FTM, 30s, pre-T, gay... and maybe genderqueer too. 

I met an adorable guy on New Year's Eve. I saw him, he was just my type, and then he spoke, and he was smart. I came out to him as trans and gay, right away, because I didn't want to be sad if he didn't like me. He still liked me. A lot. 

We spent most of the evening cuddling and talking... then kissing. We exchanged numbers, and we hung out again last night, just literally cuddling for hours. It was incredibly sweet and we confessed that we have huge crushes on each other. (I should add that the sexual tension between us was as thick as Beyonce's behind. We were powerfully attracted to each other. But we didn't go there, in fact we both expressed feelings of ""This is really important"" and ""I like you A WHOLE LOT"" and ""Let's not fuck this up, let's go slow"". So we did.)

The weird, weird, weird thing was that being with him made me feel... girly. I don't know what else to call it. I felt cute and tiny and sweet. His attention made me feel sort of... oh god, I don't know... attractive? Yeah. He made me feel pretty. I found myself wanting to hide in how he felt about me, turn his perception of me into my own. 

Part of it is that he's straight... and that I'm afraid that, when (if?) I start T, he won't like me anymore. We talked about it, and he wants to try anyway. He even talked about wanting to, uh... *do* a certain *thing* to *a certain male part of my body*... with his mouth. (!!!) But I'm still afraid with the body changes and my transformation, he won't feel like this about me anymore.

And the other part of is it that I do not want to be trans, I'd give almost anything not to be trans. I am afraid I won't be happy post-transition. I won't have a penis (I can't afford it, not unless insurance laws change). And T might ruin my voice: I'm a singer and I need to sing to be happy. 

Ugh, I promised myself I would never get with a straight guy again... 

**Have you ever experienced a shift in your perception of your gender (or a reduction in dysphoria) following a positive romantic and/or sexual interaction?** How long did it last? 

I have been trying to grok the idea that maybe I'm a genderqueer trans man. I don't know what to do about that. I feel incredibly confused. Is that even a thing? I loved feeling girly with him... but I still want my body to be masculine, just like I have for so many years. Does any of this even make sense? **Do any of the trans men here identify as genderqueer?**

I don't even understand what being genderqueer **is**, forgive me, but: I thought it was just some made-up Internet thing. Is it... me? What does that even mean? I don't deal well with abstract concepts. I am a very concrete thinker. I really don't know *how* to think about this. 

I don't want to be weird and different at all. I just want to be comfortable and at peace with myself. 

Whatever feedback comes to mind is welcome.

EDIT: I think his affection for me as a person AND his desire for my female body threw me for a loop. It felt like he was offering me love *and* a chance at normalcy.

But at Christmas, I got a shirt with a feminine cut and a perfume better suited to women. Although the perfume issue is more than just fragrance but also sinuses and alcohol-based odours, the feminine cut shirt bothers me more. Yes, it's a sports team shirt and I finally have one, but I have specified unisex t-shirts for a reason. My choice isn't so much about looking as gender neutral as possible either, which is pretty difficult with the large breasts my body developed, it ultimately does boil down to comfort too.

Hi, I'm a 17 years old DMAB and Its been a long time since I wanted to wrote here, and I finally did it

So idk really where to start 

Since a long time I had a huge problem with my gender and stuff, like since I was ""young"" like 11 people started to mistake me for a girl, like very often I didnt know if it was because I started to let grow my hairs (I never cut them since) or something else, but at is age I wasnt really caring of that 

The real trouble with gender and sexuality started when I was 15 and I had my first love, It was an internet relationship and It was a boy, so first of all I thought I was ""just"" gay, so I did my coming out to my parent everything when good (It a chance to have very open minded parents) but during this relationship a crazy thought running trough  my head, it was ""If I was born as a girl?"" and since then I wanted to be a girl and I suffer of this incapability to be a girl, but when my relationship with him stopped I downed this tough deep inside my mind, but even tho I was drowning this idea, after I get into high school, I stared to act more like a girl, more feminine

Then after that the guy who I was sharing my dorm room with started to treat me more like a girl, calling me ""princess"" or kiss me on the cheek instead of hand shaking, and after this first year of high school i really wonder what I wanted to be, I mean gender speaking

But when I really started to think about it, I had a relationship with a girl (It was last summer) so at the first time I talked to her, but she was alot anxious about it, she was telling me thing like ""Im sure you preferred if I was a boy instead of a girl "" so I didnt want to mess up this relationship so I acted up like a male, but unfortunately at the end of the summer this relationship end up 

And to be honest It was the toughest break up I ever lived, since then alot of things came back, and then first I tried to avoid it, and I did regrettable thing ...

But after those thing I started to feel more comfortable with my non binary gender, I even brought a dress at a nearby animecon (It may sound a bit weird), but after sometimes I really wonder something (imo egoistic) and it was ""Am I gonna be desirable as a non binary gender ? ""  and since then this question is taking alot of my mind 


Even tho I talked about my non binary gender to my parents, and they was ok with it, I feel a bit confused and lost sometime

And since its a new year now, I decided to brought more feminine clothes like skirts, but still this question is really ruining my mood some time 

But to be honest I have no real purpose with this post I just wanted to share a bit to my life with you

Now that I'm older I know that I wouldn't be happy being a guy either. I hate gender roles, no matter which gender's they are, it's just a grand pile of nonsense to me. I'm mostly comfortable with my body, though I do have a bit of dysphoria when it comes to the fact that I have a uterus and am able to get pregnant; I'd love to wish away those bits and just keep my vagina. And there are just some days where I hate my boobs and am envious of beautiful flat chests. All of this has brought me to the conclusion that I am agender, which also brings me to the title of this post.

I've been entertaining the idea of getting myself a binder for a couple of years now, I've just never had the guts to do it really. I want to be able to dress how I want, whenever I want. Some of my shirts would look way better on me if I was flat chested, others not so much, I just want to have options! I think anyone can wear anything, no matter which gender or lack of gender they identify as, I don't really believe in labelling clothing women's/men's wear.

I haven't ""come out"" to my parents as agender (pronoun usage once came up in conversation, not related to me, I chimed in that some people do prefer to use they as it is neutral and they went all crazy about it ""that's ridiculous, they is plural, you use he/she for singular, blah blah blah"". So yeah, not coming out to them at the moment) so I just passed the binder off as something for cosplay. I tried it on and it felt amazing! I'm a 36C and it got me down to almost flat, which is perfect and now that I'm out of the US (no more down south with all the humidity) I'm going to start wearing it more :)

35,2015-01-06 03:38:14,2rh5vh,1,2,"hello friends. this subreddit seems A LOT less intimidating / malicious / mean than some other online communities / resources on similar subjects. so i'm pretty glad this exists.

&amp;nbsp;
 
anyway, basically last night i told my girlfriend that i think i might be genderqueer / non-binary. she was perfectly understanding and supportive which made me feel really good.

&amp;nbsp;
 
regarding my identity though, i'm AMAB, but i've always had a slight aversion toward many of the main characteristics / traits that are generally associated with being a 'normal boy / man / male.' this sort of feeling has increased in intensity over time. 

&amp;nbsp;
 
identifying as non-binary seems to make sense for me because identifying as male has caused some upsetting internal conflicts for me. because a lot of the time (for one simple example) i will see something in a store that i like and i wont buy it because it seems 'effeminate' or something like that, like it doesnt align with my male gender identity. but if i were to identify non-binary, i wouldnt have this concrete 'rubric' that i have to put all of my likes / dislikes / actions / etc up against for comparison. if i identify this way theres no social construct telling me that my actions / feelings / expressions are 'wrong', and then im free to do whatever makes me happy, free to be myself.

&amp;nbsp;
 
i feel positively about they/them pronouns, but i'm also not against he/him pronouns -- to which my natural immediate response is to think that im not 'actually genderqueer' or something. i also feel comfortable with my girlfriend calling me pet-names that are strongly geared toward maleness. is it normal to not align with your birth given gender but still accept the pronouns / etc that are associated with it? does this make me 'not actually genderqueer' or something? im just having trouble validating this whole thing to myself, i feel like im being dumb or something. does this kind of thing sound like what it means to be queergender / non-binary / etc or am i maybe experiencing something else?

Alright, so, Non-Binary 101, let's go.

&gt;But how do you not ""feel like a guy?""

It is generally accepted in science that gender is a physical part of the human brain.  The most common theory is that it is affected by hormone exposure during brain development in the womb.  Remember that this is a field which hasn't had a *whole* lot of research done into it, because it's only recently been recognized as a real thing, so they're still working on figuring out the specifics.  A lot of the time you just have to take people at their word.

For more concrete evidence, try reading up on the [third interstital nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INAH_3) (INAH-3), part of our brains which has been found to be sexually dimorphic.  Namely, it's larger in men with more neurons.  In examinations of transgender cadavers, however, it's been consistently found to resemble what you would expect to find in individuals of their identified gender, regardless of if they had medically transitioned or not.

&gt;What would people say if I said I don't feel like I'm white?

Well, they'd probably laugh at you.  Unless you've got some rare skin condition, a white guy is gonna be white.  Remember that the same tumblrinas you're mocking are also the ones who get super upset about cultural appropriation.  Someone's skin color isn't part of their brain, of their perception of self; it's external and immutable.  The mental experience of being a person of color comes from having lived as a person of color--our brains are fundamentally the same.

&gt;But wtf does ""demi girl"" mean?

So, here's the thing.  There are a number of major non-binary identities accepted by the community at large.  Many of the ""gender of the day"" and ""snowflake"" terms you see on tumblr are just a result of kids wanting their own personal label, and I like to think they'll get over it eventually.  Maybe some of those terms will gain popularity and become more widely used, who knows.

The six terms you will hear the most often, that can be used by anyone, are as follows:

* agender, which refers to someone who feels they have no gender at all
* neutrois, similar to agender but considers that neutrality to be a gender on its own
* androgyne, being mentally ""in-between"" male and female
* bigender, simultaneously having a sense of being both male and female
* genderfluid, having an inconsistent or varying feeling of one's gender
* genderqueer, a catch-all term for anyone who doesn't feel as though any of the other terms work for them

There are also terms specific to certain cultures, such as *two-spirit*, which describes someone of indigenous American descent who fulfills both male and female roles within the tribe, and *hijra*, who are male-designated people from India who take on female identities and exist as an accepted third gender in their society.  Same with many *kathoey* in Thailand who might be more comfortable being seen as a ""ladyboy"" than just a lady.

Anything beyond that can almost always be safely ignored as tumblr nonsense.

In particular, ""demigirl"" and ""demiguy"" are some of those tumblr nonsense terms that have gained popularity recently and become more widely recognized as legitimate identities.  They are some of the few terms of that nature that I personally don't have a problem with.

A ""demigirl"" describes someone who is comfortable presenting female and using female pronouns to describe herself, but doesn't feel a strong connection to actually *being* entirely female.  This can either be someone designated female at birth who questions her gender but decides it isn't worth transitioning, or someone designated male that transitions despite not feeling *completely* like they're supposed to be a woman.

&gt;Dogkin, dragonkin, what does that mean, in practical terms?

Okay, so, otherkin.  Their existence is a perpetual thorn in my side, because they tend to make things more difficult for non-binary acceptance just by sounding so... nonsensical.

I tend to think of otherkin as being more of a spiritual identity than anything else.  It's someone who feels as though they have a strong connection with an animal, object, or concept, and that said connection has an effect on their personality.  Almost like a strange religion of sorts.

I respect their beliefs like I would any other spirituality or religion, but that doesn't mean I have to consider what they're saying to be legitimate.  Someone saying, ""I'm a wolfkin,"" is the same to me as them saying, ""Jesus loves me.""  I can sigh and agree with them, but that doesn't mean I have to drink the Kool-aid.

Think of gender as being a physical aspect of the human brain.  Something happened during the development of my brain to code it to run best on estrogen, but my body had already started to grow a penis and produce testosterone.  There's an innate, physical disconnect between body and mind, and it took me 20 years to figure that out--to realize why I was always unhappy.

Not all trans folk hate their genitals.  There's physical dysphoria, yes, but dysphoria can also be mental, social, emotional, and hormonal.  Personally, I'm indifferent to my penis, and I don't have enough of a problem with it to consider it worth tens-of-thousands of dollars and a number of medical risks to trade my original equipment for a close approximation of a vagina.

I started taking hormones as somewhat of a ""trial-run"" to see if it was right for me, and over a year later I've never been happier.  Having the *right* chemicals fueling my emotions was all I really needed.  Also, my hairline stopped receding before it became noticeable, so that's definitely a plus.  And boobs are certainly never a bad thing to be growing. 

Obviously some people fit the typical narrative of, ""I hate my genitals; I knew since I was a kid; I'm trapped in the wrong body,"" but for some of us it's more internal than anything.

----------",genderqueer,I posted this explanation of non-binary identities in an AskReddit thread. How did I do?,1420767977.0,"{'created_utc': 1420742777, 'id': '2rroi3', 'num_comments': 26, 'score': 7, 'selftext': '[http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2rpyxa/our_grandparents_were_racist_our_parents/cnijusl](http://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2rpyxa/our_grandparents_were_racist_our_parents/cnijusl)\n\nAlright, so, Non-Binary 101, let\'s go.\n\n&gt;But how do you not ""feel like a guy?""\n\nIt is generally accepted in science that gender is a physical part of the human brain.  The most common theory is that it is affected by hormone exposure during brain development in the womb.  Remember that this is a field which hasn\'t had a *whole* lot of research done into it, because it\'s only recently been recognized as a real thing, so they\'re still working on figuring out the specifics.  A lot of the time you just have to take people at their word.\n\nFor more concrete evidence, try reading up on the [third interstital nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INAH_3) (INAH-3), part of our brains which has been found to be sexually dimorphic.  Namely, it\'s larger in men with more neurons.  In examinations of transgender cadavers, however, it\'s been consistently found to resemble what you would expect to find in individuals of their identified gender, regardless of if they had medically transitioned or not.\n\n&gt;What would people say if I said I don\'t feel like I\'m white?\n\nWell, they\'d probably laugh at you.  Unless you\'ve got some rare skin condition, a white guy is gonna be white.  Remember that the same tumblrinas you\'re mocking are also the ones who get super upset about cultural appropriation.  Someone\'s skin color isn\'t part of their brain, of their perception of self; it\'s external and immutable.  The mental experience of being a person of color comes from having lived as a person of color--our brains are fundamentally the same.\n\n&gt;But wtf does ""demi girl"" mean?\n\nSo, here\'s the thing.  There are a number of major non-binary identities accepted by the community at large.  Many of the ""gender of the day"" and ""snowflake"" terms you see on tumblr are just a result of kids wanting their own personal label, and I like to think they\'ll get over it eventually.  Maybe some of those terms will gain popularity and become more widely used, who knows.\n\nThe six terms you will hear the most often, that can be used by anyone, are as follows:\n\n* agender, which refers to someone who feels they have no gender at all\n* neutrois, similar to agender but considers that neutrality to be a gender on its own\n* androgyne, being mentally ""in-between"" male and female\n* bigender, simultaneously having a sense of being both male and female\n* genderfluid, having an inconsistent or varying feeling of one\'s gender\n* genderqueer, a catch-all term for anyone who doesn\'t feel as though any of the other terms work for them\n\nThere are also terms specific to certain cultures, such as *two-spirit*, which describes someone of indigenous American descent who fulfills both male and female roles within the tribe, and *hijra*, who are male-designated people from India who take on female identities and exist as an accepted third gender in their society.

61,2015-01-08 22:22:05,2rshiy,9,1,"Hello friends! I dearly hope it's alright to post this here - seems like one of the best places to get answers! (also very sorry for the amount of writing - I wasn't sure what to include)

I'm in the middle of writing a book and while I don't want to dive into detail, I will tell you that it's quite character-driven and the world surrounding my characters is very accepting. With this knowledge in mind I set about creating my characters and soon I discovered that while most my cast identified as male and female, three/four of my characters moved into a different zone. Let's call these characters Alex, Andy, Charlie and Paul - however I will not likely go in-depth with Paul. This book is also set in a time where there is royalty.

Alex defines as female, uses female pronouns, is introduced as female (""And my youngest, Princess Alex!"") and wears female clothes. She is MAAB though and doesn't seek to change her voice. My main character does notice this (and Alex's lack of chest) and somewhat informs the reader that Alex is male, but there is no further comment or disrespect. But later on there is a comment from a different character: She says 'prince' and then adds the 'ss' in a higher, mocking and hiss-like sound.

Andy defines as genderqueer/fluid, uses female pronouns, is introduced as another character's sister and wears female clothing. She is FAAB. She uses two names and corrects people on which name she is at the moment (one name is male and the other is female, the female name sounds neutral through); she is also called a 'handsome sweetheart' by her oldest brother. Andy and Alex end up getting together in the end.

Charlie defines as genderfluid/queer, uses the 'they' pronoun and I'm still working on how they'll be introduced. They are MAAB. Charlie was born into a family where everyone was respected - this included calling people 'sir' and 'madam'; Charlie's voice is also not what you'd say was kind on the ears and they come across as having quite a 'whiny, high-pitched English accent' that knocks off/replaces letters like a cockney accent (or at least my limited understanding of a cockney accent). But there's a problem; this world is very accepting of everybody, so I figured I'd use 'other' to describe the non-gendered nobles - but then I began using it on myself (I being genderqueer/fluid) and hated the term with a fiery passion. So I've switched it to 'mix'. Now, when Charlie is being referred to and introduced someone would say: Mix Charlie [..]. Charlie also wears a bow at some points when defining as more on the female side - I toyed around with them using a different name, too, but my beta reader has said it just confuses it.

Why am I writing all this and not asking a proper question I hear you ask? Well, these characters sort of *are* my questions; how do you feel about them?

With Alex-

* How do you feel about the main character clearly judging her on appearance but not being disrespectful when meeting her?

* How do you feel about another character (one who *lives* for causing trouble/drama) making a remark like this?

With Andy-

* How do you feel about her correcting people on her names?

* How do you feel about the 'handsome sweetheart' comments from her brother

* How should her siblings describe her? I've been looking towards the idea of 'broister' (brother and sister mixed); how does that sound?

With Charlie-

* Just how do you feel about this character in general?

* How do you feel about 'sir' 'madam' and 'mix'? Is there already something else I should consider?

And finally, is there anything about the characters that would put you off? The subject of gender is approached very softly in the book (it includes a scene where one character (who defines as male) is uncomfortably aware of having to put on a female voice to fool a noble - though I'm still not too sure on this one) and while it isn't the main focus, I don't want to draw people away from reading the book because of a word or because the main character is a bit stupid (looks Alex up and down and inwardly comments on her being flat-chested and again then informing the reader that, by Alex's voice, he believes she's actually male). I know I'm stepping on personal grounds here because gender *is* a very personal and important thing and I know I'll never be able to make everyone happy with these characters but I can damn well try!

I am androgynous, but my wardrobe and appearance are that of my biological sex.

I'm also planning to unofficially change my name to a gender neutral name. I've used my birth name for so many years, I worry about changing it, and learning to respond to the new name and how my family will react. Has anyone here changed their name? How did your parents react to the change? How long did it take for the new name to come naturally?

73,2015-01-10 06:25:52,2rxxi5,5,7,"hello everyone, long time lurker but first time poster. i've been feeling really anxious about my gender identity and how it will put me at a disadvantage in life. 

for the past year i have been wrestling with myself about my gender - i'm afab and was fine with it for 20 years, but for half my life i was severely depressed and kind of just going through the motions of life. i did whatever people told me to do and didn't really have any plans other than survive and i just generally felt shitty most of the time. the good news is i've decided i want to get better but when i made that decision it required a lot of soul searching and in that time i learned i don't feel female all the time. in fact, most of the time i feel like i have no gender. and i can't stress enough *i don't want to feel this way*. i want to go back to feeling fine with being female but for some reason some inner part of me won't let me do that. i'll try to explain my situation further down.

basically this feeling is so strong that it's been extremely distressing and confusing for a few reasons - 1) i keep doubting myself 2) i don't really hate my body that much, i just wish i was built more gender neutral 3) i don't know what my gender is - i keep switching b/w feeling kinda ok w/ being female to completely not wanting to associate w/ that identity at all 4) i feel like maybe i'm making a big deal out of nothing and i wasted all my time feeling scared while doing nothing about it 5) i'm confused because i've known i was queer my entire life but i'm only just starting to reevaluate my gender 6) i fear i will be accused of being a ""special snowflake"" because i keep reading online that having a nb gender isn't real and no one would take me seriously 

don't get me wrong though - i don't hate the feminine gender identity. in fact, i want to embrace my feminine identity, but a nagging feeling inside me says i'm not a girl, i'm something else. i also don't hate the agender identity. if i lived in a vacuum, everything would be fine. but because of the situation i'm in, i fear i will never be able to accept that part of me. 

anyway, the reason why i want to just feel fine with my assigned gender rather than just accept myself is because i am terrified that if i make physical changes to look less feminine and start telling everyone to use they/them and call me my preferred name (all of which will make me feel more comfortable), i will not be able to find a high enough paying job that i can pay all my student loans back. i studied sociology bc i wasn't good at anything else at a private university my parents picked for me and am now 78k in the hole. if i am able to suppress my gender confusion then i MIGHT have a shot at getting a job that will pay me enough to pay my loans back, but if i don't, then no one will hire me and the loans will get bigger. i don't even know what i want to do w/ my life other than wanting to help people and make the world a better place. i feel the most content knowing i made someone happy, even though i hate myself.

anyway, i could use some advice on what to do. i am not out to anyone (i guess myself included?), i'm dealing w/ all this in addition to improving my mental health, i don't have any friends, and frankly i'm losing hope that i will ever be happy and live authentically. thankfully i live near an organization that provides free therapy to LGBT youth under 25, so my gender therapist has been so so supportive and helpful. but i'm under the wire here, i need to start paying my loans back but during my job search i feel like i have to either choose b/w my mental health (in presenting myself how i want) or my physical survival (in presenting how i'm assigned).

I've never been big on labels, so maybe that's why this is so hard for me to wrap my head around, but here goes.

I recently discovered the term ""Androgyne"" and for the past couple of weeks I've been wondering if that's what I am. Now, I don't like labels, so trying to fit myself into one, even if it's basically casting aside gender labels, doesn't sit quite right with me.

I've spent like the last year questioning my sexuality and now I realise after surpressing it and lying to myself that I'm bisexual...and also in someways genderqueer. 

I'm male bodied and I love by body. I mad on triathlon and I'm really satisfied with my body - tummy, face privates and all. However occasionally I feel I'm neither gender, agender. So my questions are: 

   **1)** Can I be genderqueer yet still feel 100% content with my physical appearance and not get dysphoria?  

   **2)** Also would the correct word to describe this switching between guy and agender (in fact is that even possible?!) be bigender or is that reserved for switching between boy and girl? Would genderfluid or genderqueer be okay labels too? 

  **3)** Finally, to save hassle of explaining sexuality properly to people I mainly just say I'm a boy and use he/his/him pronouns, is that alright or would it be better say I'm bigender or genderfluid or genderqueer? 

And just food for thought: could my bisexuality be related to my genderqueerness/bigender-ness somehow?  Like given I feel agender could that influence my attraction to guys and girls?

We need:

* Moderators - people who can work on flairs and set up fun things to do and contribute

* Writers - people who will use the subreddit as a way of getting writing out there, critique out there, anything

**Some of the ideas put forward about the subreddit**:

* Prompts - anyone can submit a prompt, and other writers can answer it! *Idea from* /u/CedarWolf

* Writing Collection - where a mod would set a topic, have one person collect all submissions, host the submissions, and boom. *Idea from* /u/abandonthefort

* A weekly selfie post - to collect all selfies in one week of all the members who want to be involved! *Idea from* /u/Sixthsomatic

110,2015-01-17 18:11:19,2sr2f1,5,4,"So lately I've been getting headaches, dizziness, irregular heartbeat, Basically I realized that I got aminia because I have a physical disability that causes stomach cramps if I eat a normal sized plate of food - usually ending with my head in a toilet. Lately I've kept to my small sizes but have been walking around more because of collage, commuting to partner etc.  

I also noticed something else: When I feel sick because of my low body weight I feel female. However when I'm not sick I feel more comfortable and masculine (male mindframe).

135,2015-01-21 17:42:04,2t6vi7,6,6,"Hello. I'm 19 and biologically female. I have presented myself as female for most of my life, except for the few times I tried to do otherwise and was discouraged from doing so by various authority figures. However, I don't always identify as female. Sometimes I feel like I'm female, sometimes I feel like I'm male, and other times I feel like both, or neither. I've always been referred to, and referred to myself, with female pronouns. I have an extremely feminine body, but really the only reason I dress in a traditionally feminine manner is because it works to my advantage, lol. Evidently, people think I'm attractive, and I can get free stuff XD. But that's beside the point.

I remember when I was in 5th grade, I asked my mom if we could go shopping for ""boy clothes."" She said yes, but that we had to go to The Gap (I hated the majority of their clothes, and in hindsight I think this was an attempt to deter me from cross-dressing). 

Anyway, we went shopping, and she picked out some ""boy clothes"" for me to try on. I did, but they were all extremely garish or didn't fit right, so I asked her if I could pick out some clothes, and she said yes, but we were in a hurry to be somewhere else, so if I didn't want the ones she had picked, we may not have time to buy ""boy clothes"" that day (again, I think she was trying to discourage me). Anyway, I remember I picked out some jeans, a few shirts, and a pair of camo cargo pants (I really liked the pants and wanted them so badly. They were so cool!). Unfortunately, as soon as I got back to the dressing room, my mother said that there wasn't enough time for me to try them on, and that we had to leave, empty-handed. I didn't ask again, because I think I knew that she didn't want me to wear ""boy clothes."" I got the hint.

Fast forward to 7th grade. I came out to my family as ""bisexual"" (I was aware of sexuality at a very young age). My mother said that it was just a phase and that I'd be ""boy-crazy soon."" She didn't forget to mention that ""being attracted to girls if you're a girl is wrong."" My father didn't really seem to care one way or another (he's always been way more accepting of that sort of thing than my mom). After hearing my mother invalidate what I had said, I never talked about it again. She had made me feel like I had done something wrong, like I was a freak. Shortly thereafter I became extremely depressed, started self-harming, and was hospitalized 3 times for suicide attempts.

Now on to 8th and half of 9th grade. At this point I was at an all-girls' residential treatment center (due to being a suicide risk) in Utah. I remember getting in trouble on multiple occasions for ""dating"" other girls there (dating was pretty much just cute nicknames and holding hands, because ya know, treatment. -.-*). I was notorious for being a flirt. Also at this point, I had chopped almost all of my hair off (I had a ""pixie cut"" with a long fringe). My hair had been almost down to my waist prior to this. I also frequently cross-dressed, which was discouraged at that treatment center, though they tolerated in more than my mother had. Unfortunately, they actually tried to incorporate what I like to call ""straightening-out"" into my therapy at one point. I eventually left the program shortly after one of the male staff was convicted of multiple counts of rape of one of the girls.

Now on to the rest of high school. I presented myself as a straight female throughout 10th-12th grade, because upon returning to my home state (in the Bible Belt) I learned really quick that high-school kids will rip you to shreds if they learn that your sexuality is ""out of the norm."" Needless to say, high school was an extremely difficult time for me.

But now, I've been out of high school for almost 2 years, and I've had some time to discover myself. I'm definitely going to keep my feminine appearance (at least for now) because I am able to get a lot of free things and favors because of it, not to mention I still live with my parents (I do still cross-dress on occasion, though).

But I'm not sure if I'm genderqueer or what. I've been told by some of my female friends that the way I act can be extremely masculine, or at least not feminine. And sometimes I feel like I'm female, sometimes I feel like I'm male, and other times I feel like both, or neither.

I would see women on the train or the street that fit my aesthetic/style, and would feel attraction; but as time went on, I started to feel like that feeling was lesser so attraction, but perhaps envy. Dysphoria became a pretty constant thing for me, and I started to think might be a girl. I talked to friends and roommates, who all encouraged me to experiment as I saw comfortable; my nails are now always painted (although playing guitar makes them  chip almost instantly), I regularly wear tights under my jeans, and I've started shaving my legs. My family and larger group of friends is aware of this, and don't seem to mind/notice. Within the closer circle that were aware of my dysphoria, I occasionally wear the couple dresses and skirts I have, and go by they/them pronouns. With every step I've taken - shaving, painting nails, wearing dresses - I've felt very comfortable with the results. That said, I've still never really felt a desire to present 100% feminine; I liked how I looked as a dude in a dress with painted nails and stubble. Earlier today, however, I took off my shirt, and I caught myself thinking how the image I saw would be better with breasts.

Super queer, run an underground LGBT club at my school because they won't allow us to have one, the idea of 'other' sexualities and gender identities is not something new to me at all.  Thought I was just a tomboy all my life, but fleeting desires to just *try* passing as male about three times in the past two years. But since September, I've really been finding that I don't really feel male or female.

Sometimes I want to dress and act like a guy but not necessarily pass. Sometimes I want to dress and act like guy and want to pass.

I'm talking to some friends, I decided that I was going to start wearing and buying clothes that felt more like me. But this means I have to try on and buy guys clothing. And wow... THAT IS REALLY STRESSFUL. Finding clothes that fit well will be an issue in seeing because of my body type. But that's a bridge to cross at a later date. I'm looking into getting a binder which is also for a later date. About the only thing I've done is bought boxers to wear (I've worn my sleepy time boxers a few times and loved it--it felt so me, so I'm excited about having more to wear), gotten less feminine looking jeans, and have some guys shoes. My roommate just thinks I'm kind of butch. But I don't know what she'll do if she finds out I'm questioning my gender identity. I get the idea she won't be ok with it like she is with queer sexualities. So I'm stressed about what will happen if she finds out. But also really excited to start dressing more like me. 

This is super exciting! And less stressful in some ways now that I kind of understand me more. But now I have to worry about what happens if some people find out. And how I am going to go about buying more clothes that feel like me.

But that's a bridge to cross at a later date. I'm looking into getting a binder which is also for a later date. About the only thing I've done is bought boxers to wear (I've worn my sleepy time boxers a few times and loved it--it felt so me, so I'm excited about having more to wear), gotten less feminine looking jeans, and have some guys shoes. My roommate just thinks I'm kind of butch. But I don't know what she'll do if she finds out I'm questioning my gender identity. I get the idea she won't be ok with it like she is with queer sexualities. So I'm stressed about what will happen if she finds out. But also really excited to start dressing more like me. \n\nThis is super exciting! And less stressful in some ways now that I kind of understand me more. But now I have to worry about what happens if some people find out. And how I am going to go about buying more clothes that feel like me. \n\nAnyway. Sorry for the wall of text. But I needed to vent and was hoping someone here might have some advice.

I end up sharing my pic with her because why not and she notices it's linked to this sub so she's like umm genderqueer? Guessing the confusion comes from male character/male presentation, where's the queer? So I explained yes I'm queer, kinda nonbinary but with a preference to male. So ok. She actually is genderqueer too apparently but is still learning all the terms and whatnot(she is young).

Anyway, the next day she greets me by asking what pronouns she should use for me. I'm taken aback a little but explain to her again I'm a guy just use guy terms no need to get fancy. She said she just wanted to be sure, ok.... I think she is still unsure of what everything means since she thought nonbinary meant I was pansexual.

But now I'm feeling insecure for some reason. I don't like it when someone thinks of me as anything other than a guy, so am I really nonbinary? I'm feeling uncomfortable about presenting as nonbinary now if it's going to confuse people on what to address me as... I don't want to be ""special"", I want to be ordinary? But I know I'm not. I dunno. I don't want to be associated with female terms, I like male terms, and I wouldn't mind a neutral term... I guess I am fighting my femininity so much that I get defensive over my masculinity? I think somewhere in my mind I was using nonbinary as a way to confront the ""you don't look like a guy"" or similar comments.

I had a fun dream the other day that got me thinking about non-binary pride. Although I personally struggle with being proud of my gender, I am on my way to becoming a teacher, and I worry that my future genderqueer students (however few there may be) may not feel as good about themselves as they should. I realized that if I were to teach my 13-year-old self, I would not know what to say or do to make myself proud of who I was.

Now, I know that I could probably do a decent job convincing a genderqueer student that there is nothing wrong with them, or, at least, I have ideas. (I would have really liked to have someone explain to my 13-year-old self that gender was not binary. That would have squashed some anxiety. :D) However, I am not just interested in making students feel less bad; I want them to feel good about being non-binary. This may seem a little contradictory, but I think there is a real difference between not feeling ashamed of who you are and feeling proud of who you are. I think the difference is evident when someone is not afraid to come out as genderqueer versus when someone wants to advertise that they are genderqueer. I want students to not just *not worry* about who they are. I want them to *celebrate* who they are.

I feel like this is a conundrum for the queer/LGBT+ community in general, hence pride parades and so on. However, I would prefer to hear something genderqueer specific.

173,2015-01-25 20:28:25,2tn9dv,5,4,"Hey all,
I'm trying to find someone who's been through this before. 

When I was a child, I was pretty agender. I identified as not-female. I never identified as male (but growing up in a small town in the 90s, that was never a possibility anyway). When puberty hit, I started to hate myself. There were some outside factors, but the biggest one was that I didn't want to be female. I didn't want to be seen as female. I hated it. I still do.

I get really moody for 2-3 weeks of the month. I can feel the effects of female hormones 2 weeks before my period. It's manageable then, but it's completely unbearable 7-10 days before my period and 3-4 days after it starts. I've talked to doctors about this. They've put me on different kinds of BC, which just made me slightly crazy all the time instead of very crazy most of the time. I tried antidepressants and I ended up with permanent, sometimes debilitating anxiety, so I'm not taking anything like that again. 

When I first got my period, and for a lot of my early adulthood, I would have done anything to have my ovaries removed. I now know they won't take your ovaries without putting you on some kind of hormone. So I'm thinking about T.

The problem is, I don't want to be male. I don't identify as male. I could live as a gay man, but I've lived all my life presenting as female. I don't know where to start. I don't have a support network. I tried going to a non-binary support group, I met a really cool person there, but I just don't have the energy to make friends right now. I don't really want to be male, and I don't really want to be in between. I know how society treats us, and I don't want that experience. I've already started dressing more masculine, got a male haircut, and I am treated completely different. I don't like it. I hate being seen as female but it's easier than this. Except for the inability to function 2-3 weeks out of 4.

But I keep thinking that T is the only way out of this. I just have to accept the consequences so I can get these toxic hormones in check. I'm afraid low-dose won't give me the experience of living with testosterone in my body, and I'm afraid the effects will be permanent if I go with a higher dose. My doctor is supportive, but clueless. I know everyone says it takes a while for the changes to be permanent, but I'm sensitive and aware of my body. I'd notice and I'd hate myself if the T didn't fix the moodiness.

So, anyone been through something similar?

179,2015-01-26 22:13:27,2trpye,6,4,"Every time I start wondering how I'm doing gender-wise, I always find myself dwelling the most on what kids have said. In general, I'm talking about children aged 3-12 years old (once they're around middle school age, they start inserting discretion; i.e., they are more likely to go along with the gender that they think someone is going for). I  consider myself agender: no label seems right, but for whatever it's worth, I'm part of the AFAB group. Depending on hair length, I can pass as male or female. I successfully pulled off both in high school and college amongst people my age and older. What's weird is that even when adults are confident in gendering me female, children are reluctant. I've had dozens of embarrassed parents trying to correct their kids subtly. Just last month I had a child no older than four ask her mother very matter-of-factly why someone who wasn't a girl was allowed in a girl's bathroom. She was emphatic that I wasn't female, but she never called me male. Now maybe she thought I was male, but being the genderqueer person I am, it stayed in my mind that she never said ""boy"" or ""male"". She just kept repeating ""not a girl"".

So here's my question: on average, do you think children are honest sources and a good representation of what people really think for how well a person passes as a gender? Are their observations accurate feedback?

I keep going back and forth with this because part of me says, ""Yes! Young kids don't filter. What you see is what you get. If a five year old calls you sir, you must look male."" But then another voice pipes up and says, ""Children are inundated with gendering information: cartoons, toys, story lines in books and movies--there are a lot of messages for young kids about what it is to a girl or boy. Girls wear pink. Boys like sports. They see and hear these stereotypes all day long. If they called you sir, maybe you had an outfit on that wasn't pink, and they went with the simplest explanation that their young mind could provide. Maybe they went with the easiest answer. Girls wear make up and have purses. This person does not have make up or a purse. This person must be a man."" 

I keep going in circles, and I can't decide what's more true: that kids are accurate or easily misled?. Sure, there will be some kids in both categories, but as a whole, what description seems most realistic?

She just kept repeating ""not a girl"".\n\nSo here\'s my question: on average, do you think children are honest sources and a good representation of what people really think for how well a person passes as a gender? Are their observations accurate feedback?\n\nI keep going back and forth with this because part of me says, ""Yes! Young kids don\'t filter. What you see is what you get. If a five year old calls you sir, you must look male."" But then another voice pipes up and says, ""Children are inundated with gendering information: cartoons, toys, story lines in books and movies--there are a lot of messages for young kids about what it is to a girl or boy. Girls wear pink. Boys like sports. They see and hear these stereotypes all day long. If they called you sir, maybe you had an outfit on that wasn\'t pink, and they went with the simplest explanation that their young mind could provide. Maybe they went with the easiest answer. Girls wear make up and have purses. This person does not have make up or a purse. This person must be a man."" \n\nI keep going in circles, and I can\'t decide what\'s more true: that kids are accurate or easily misled?. Sure, there will be some kids in both categories, but as a whole, what description seems most realistic?\n\nThoughts?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Are Children Uniquely Honest in Gendering People?', 'created': 1422335607.0}"

Since I started questioning my sexuality around a year ago there's been this confliction between my orientation and gender identity.  

I used to think I was trans* (gendgenderqueer) and also bisexual. However recently I've started to realise I'm gay and I also haven't felt like I'm genderqueer eithe,  more just a cis guy.  I have thought that maybe I actually am bisbisexual after all and during this time I've started to feel more aagender again.  I'm starting to realise that I am actually just gay though.

This got me wondering whether my confusion about my orientation caused me to question my gender identity also. Can anyone make sense of this or relate to it?

DMAB (Designated male at birth?) am I doing that right? I'm 22 and have lived and expressed myself as a guy ever since I was born. However when I was 11-13ish (I can't remember, sorry) I remember being home alone and dressing up in my sisters clothes. It felt right and I was very happy. 


I thought it may have just been something with a crossdressing thing of sorts, but recently I took the fetish part out of the equation and found I'm still really happy when i'm dressed in feminine clothing. Part of me feels complete, and happy when I'm dressed. 


I'm naturally very hairy and I'm quite a bit overweight compared to people my height (5'5 - 185lbs). I've grown to hate seeing my body hair on my chest, legs and face. While I hate seeing my hair on my face, up until last night I had quite the full beard. I'm not sure if it's because I'm lazy or just part of me hating it I'm like 'fuck it, i'll just let it hang'.


So more background, my sister is a lesbian and is married to admittedly a wonderful girl for her. It took me far longer than I'd like to admit to come to terms with that because we were raised in a conservative, christian family. I was taught that gay was a sin and such. I've become more liberal and I am all for peoples rights now. 

But... I'm struggling to come to terms with what my feelings mean about me. I'm having some sorts of an existential crisis. I feel like I want to be a girl 20% of the time, but the other 80% I'm all guy. 

Last night after I had talked to my non binary friend (how I learned of the terms/and started looking into it, it brought up more questions for myself) I shaved literally everything I could and I felt really really happy. 

What does this mean? Can someone help me with how I can get answers?

I'm sure a couple of you saw my previous post about my mother's unwillingness to use my preferred name and pronouns.

However, as you all know, therapy is the first step in the process. 

So last night I was up, riddled with anxiety over what was happening. This morning my mother asked me what was up and I told her I need to go back to therapy, because I had so much on my mind. She asked the inevitable, ""What's going on?"". And so I let it out, I told her that I need to see a gender therapist to discuss things. She asked me bluntly, if I was going to change my gender to male. I took this opportunity to explain to her that gender is a spectrum and I fall somewhere in the middle, but not on either side comfortably. She was surprisingly receptive, even to the idea of me taking T for a period of time, she just wants me to happy it seems. I'm so relieved and so happy. I'm wondering what will happen if I mention going on T to my doctor on Monday (an unrelated appointment) and gauge his reaction. Apparently in my state there are ways to work around the 1 year waiting period? Not really sure how all that works. But I'm nonetheless excited to have her support. I feel like it will help my father be more accepting as well.

I've spent like the last year questioning my sexuality and now I realise after surpressing it and lying to myself that I'm bisexual...and also in someways genderqueer. 

I'm male bodied and I love by body. I mad on triathlon and I'm really satisfied with my body - tummy, face privates and all. However occasionally I feel I'm neither gender, agender. So my questions are: 

   **1)** Can I be genderqueer yet still feel 100% content with my physical appearance and not get dysphoria?  

   **2)** Also would the correct word to describe this switching between guy and agender (in fact is that even possible?!) be bigender or is that reserved for switching between boy and girl? Would genderfluid or genderqueer be okay labels too? 

  **3)** Finally, to save hassle of explaining sexuality properly to people I mainly just say I'm a boy and use he/his/him pronouns, is that alright or would it be better say I'm bigender or genderfluid or genderqueer? 

And just food for thought: could my bisexuality be related to my genderqueerness/bigender-ness somehow?  Like given I feel agender could that influence my attraction to guys and girls?

26,2015-01-15 13:35:14,2sih3q,6,6,"Throwaway, fairly active redditor.

I am 25 years old, 5'9, 235 lbs, cismale I think the term is? I honestly don't know how I grew breasts, but I have two theories. I think my gynecomastia started when I became overweight around 19 years old, just over six years ago. I had an appendectomy. I was exhausted and stopped exercising, I assumed it was postoperative fatigue, trauma of an invasive operation and overeating after I recovered. I don't exercise anymore. I was near 300 at one point but that was from strict dieting. I'm comfortable with my weight at this point.
I also have been taking Casodex daily for the last four years to prevent male pattern baldness. I did this under an endocrinologist's care. I knew of the drug's potentially feminizing side-effects, but I felt immense relief to not go bald. Over the past 4 years, I've grown breasts of 36D bra size and they appear identically female, with ducts and enlarged areoles. They don't bother me at all.


As of the last six or seven months or so, people repeatedly ask me if im a girl because I have long hair and boobs and a very feminine looking body and fat pattern. I mean its a daily thing whenever I go out. I shave my face so maybe that is a reason? I decided to crossdress a few months ago just once to see if I really do look female. I got pantyhose, a long dress, panties, bra and women's flats and tied my hair back. I took a photo and posted on social media ""Do I really look better as a woman like everyone says?"" It was an overwhelming yes, dozens of likes. People kept asking if I was transgender and I didn't know what that meant then. For the past few months I been thinking over and over why do I look feminine physically and maybe if I should live full time as a woman and identify as a woman. I would be the exact same person, still be a homebody and a gamer but just living as a female and I don't have any problem with that. My own mother thinks I look like a woman at this point with male clothes.


I have had a decent childhood, father passed young, have a good, open and tolerant family, used to be athletic but after i stopped working out I became a coder and gamer and enjoy both very much. I've never thought of being a female before, never wanted to be before, don't hate or dislike my genitals, never crossdressed while young, content with life, never was suicidal, usually just wear shorts and long t-shirts. I don't mean to offend with anything I am saying but just putting my personal situation out there. What does this mean? Has anyone here felt the same? I was also advised that about the binary or lack thereof and there are people out there who some days ""feel"" like a man and other days wake up ""feeling"" like a woman. That also appeals in a way to do as I please.

tl;dr Cismale? with severe gynecomastia and no prior gender issues consistently asked for months if I am female in public, crossdress once to verify, post on social media and have an overwhemingly postive response that I do look better as a woman and repeatedly asked if I was transgender.

I don\'t mean to offend with anything I am saying but just putting my personal situation out there. What does this mean? Has anyone here felt the same? I was also advised that about the binary or lack thereof and there are people out there who some days ""feel"" like a man and other days wake up ""feeling"" like a woman. That also appeals in a way to do as I please.\n\ntl;dr Cismale? with severe gynecomastia and no prior gender issues consistently asked for months if I am female in public, crossdress once to verify, post on social media and have an overwhemingly postive response that I do look better as a woman and repeatedly asked if I was transgender. Look very feminine physically despite my weight or due to it and thinking maybe I should live as a woman or switch between presentations at will.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Very confused for a few months now, need advice.

27,2015-01-16 08:34:01,2sm1ck,2,6,"I'm going to apologize now because I know this post is probably going to end up being long. Anyway, I guess I'll start by saying that there have been a lot of recent changes in my life--the main one being my deconversion from Christianity. I grew up in a household with two Christian parents. My dad doesn't talk about his religious beliefs much, but my mother is a total fundie. Four years ago, I started on the journey that led to me becoming an atheist. I have been an atheist for two years now.

Since that change, I have had to question a lot of my moral and ethical beliefs. My world was essentially turned upside down. I kinda of feel like I lived in a bubble for most of my life, and now I'm finally free to actually figure out who I am. 

Something that occurred to me in the last month is that, even though I have always identified as a cisgender female, I have never in my life felt like one. When I was a child I played with toys that boys typically played with. I hated girls clothing. I preferred playing with boys outside in the dirt than playing inside with barbies like the rest of the little girls my age. As a teenager, none of that really changed. I was pretty miserable throughout middle school and high school... never feeling like I fit in anywhere or with anyone. 

I think the reason I never questioned how I truly felt about a lot of things was because I had it stuck in my head that I needed to be a ""good little Christian girl"" who her parents could be proud of. It didn't matter how I felt-- it mattered how everyone else felt about me. I wanted desperately to fit in, and to feel like I belonged somewhere. 

Now that I'm in my mid/late twenties, I feel like I can be honest with myself for the first time; I'm no longer trying to fit into a mold that doesn't work for me. That being said, I'm able to admit to myself that I almost never feel feminine. In fact, I'm not sure I ever have. Most of the time, I don't feel like I'm male or female... just someone who floats somewhere in between. Other times, I most definitely feel male.

Typically when I'm in the presence of men, I don't feel feminine or masculine. It's a little different when I'm in the presence of men who come off as total creepers though-- like I'm suddenly more aware of my biological gender or something. When a guy hits on me and his advances aren't welcomed, I feel weak and small and anxious.... and I guess a little of something that might be considered feminine? I don't even know. 

When I'm around other women... I DEFINITELY don't feel feminine, or like a woman. I feel masculine and just horribly horribly awkward. I also feel obligated to do things like pay for things they want, open doors for them, and become oddly protective of them. I don't understand it, but I think my awkwardness around other women has cost me almost every friendship that I've had with them. No female has ever explicitly stated that I seem weird around other girls, or that they feel weird around me. Usually my female friends just kind of drift away, without there ever being a clear reason as to why. 

I know that I am sexually attracted to men, however becoming emotionally attracted to a man is rare. I know also that I am very emotionally attracted to women, however I can't say for sure whether or not I'm physically attracted to them.  I have no experience with that kind of thing. I don't even know any people that identify as something other than the gender they were assigned at birth.

If I could have been born male, I probably would have chosen that option... but as of right now, I don't have a desire to change my appearance or sex organs. I am fine with who I am physically... I just don't really understand everything else that's going on in my head. I know the reasons why I have ignored these thoughts and feelings for so long, but the drastic change in my ways of thinking in the last few years has left me a little overwhelmed by it all. 

These feelings I have are not something I really feel comfortable sharing with anyone that I know in person, so I figured I might be able to get some feedback from complete strangers xD. Have any of you had similar feelings? If so, how have you managed to cope with them? Is there a gender I seem to identify most with? I seem to think genderfluid fits me the best... but I'm honestly not sure. Also, do you perhaps know of some things I should read so that I could better understand who I am in terms of gender?

The purpose for my study is to document a deeper understanding of gender fluid identity and expression . Ultimately my goal is to examine and show the ambiguous relationship between gender and sex. I am currently searching for people who identify as gender fluid to participate in this study. The study will minimally require a 20-45 minutes interview that will address some of the following topics: what it means to be gender fluid, your realization of your gender identity, gender misinterpretation, and so forth. These interviews will be conducted via Skype, so having a Skype account will be necessary. Although I would prefer to audio record these interviews, I completely understand if you are uncomfortable with that. Therefore, having your interview recorded is optional. These recordings will be transcribed for analytical and citational purposes.
In addition, you may choose to participate in field observations if you are in the West Coast of the United States. Field observations will involve you being observed interacting with others for no more than two hours.

30,2015-01-18 03:32:16,2ssrio,4,5,"Hey, so I literally just found out about genderfluidity and it *perfectly* describes how I feel. My normal day to day life is very happily male, but for the longest time it feels like 20% of me has always wanted to be a girl. I always feel like I am missing out on something but not being able to live some of my life as a girl. Since I was little I have always felt kind of like this and I even have acted upon the feelings quite a few times and dressed up when in private (rather decently I think!). It's not something I'd want permanently, but just something I wish I could live as a girl from time to time.

So knowing that being genderfluid is a thing makes me happy, it's nice that there are other people like me! How do you all deal with feeling like this? I *really* wish I could sometimes just walk outside one day in girl mode and not have anyone question it. Like I want to try things like shaving my legs, growing my hair out, putting on makeup, but I just feel like it will disrupt my normal social life so much. I've considered traveling to a distant area for a vacation sort of thing where I spend a week or so living as a girl, but idk. Living the other side has just almost always felt like a fantasy and never something that could be reality, especially when trying to maintain my normal male social life.

So what do you all do to express yourself as the other gender despite how your friends/social circle perceive you?

I am a female and like it.. well sometimes... I recently had a dream of what it would be like to be a male, specifically having a penis and I got really excited about it.

37,2015-01-21 18:22:43,2t713e,2,4,"Over Christmas I had a dream where I got to be a male, have a penis the whole works. When I woke up the feeling was so strong and I wanted that so much. I also realized that this wasn't the first time that I have had this dream. Before I never thought much about it, just figured it was a dream and that was there was to it. But this time, now being in college, knowing that there are more then just typical male and female genders. I started to really look into it and that maybe I wasn't alone in this feeling. For the most part I have been pretty happy with my body, some times more than not. I don't have a large chest, which when I feel female its annoying, I look like I'm 14. Also my biggest assets is just that my ass and hips, but compared to other females still very small, its just the biggest thing on me lol. And I am okay with this when I have male like days because it is easier to hide what little female shape I do have. When I started exploring and really thinking about giving into the male feelings I became 10x happier with myself and body.

I am taking a Sociology class and we spoke a lot about masculinity and this just made the timing perfect. The other night, I had a guy friend staying the night with me, without knowing that I was doing it, I realized that I was laying the same way he was. Any time he moved I tried to lay the same way. Then again in class to day, I found myself looking at the guys in my group and noticing how they sat, what they wore, how they presented themselves. Then while being in class we all get a taste of things and make us think about what we do in out everyday lives. So I can get in insite to how they think. 

This made me really excited, since I can't full dress and waiting on my Packer to arrive, it makes me feel excited that in some way I'm still exploring this new idea and to figure out who I am. It is difficult to model myself after males when I'm not in presence of males a lot. My major is only made of females, I spend all day with females. The only male that I talk to and see and somewhat conferrable with he has no idea about my exploring or do I know if he would be okay with it. So I observe him in secret but its hard when I cant ask question I want to ask. While the only male that I have told and totally supports me is over 1,000 miles away. In those aspect makes it really hard to figure out how to present and model after.

The other night, I had a guy friend staying the night with me, without knowing that I was doing it, I realized that I was laying the same way he was. Any time he moved I tried to lay the same way. Then again in class to day, I found myself looking at the guys in my group and noticing how they sat, what they wore, how they presented themselves. Then while being in class we all get a taste of things and make us think about what we do in out everyday lives. So I can get in insite to how they think. \n\nThis made me really excited, since I can't full dress and waiting on my Packer to arrive, it makes me feel excited that in some way I'm still exploring this new idea and to figure out who I am. It is difficult to model myself after males when I'm not in presence of males a lot. My major is only made of females, I spend all day with females. The only male that I talk to and see and somewhat conferrable with he has no idea about my exploring or do I know if he would be okay with it. So I observe him in secret but its hard when I cant ask question I want to ask. While the only male that I have told and totally supports me is over 1,000 miles away. In those aspect makes it really hard to figure out how to present and model after. \n\nSince the morning of the dream I had and exploring things have made much more since, happier and more excited!"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Realization and Update!', 'created': 1421889763.0}"
