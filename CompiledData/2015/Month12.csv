I have a gender, I know I do, but it's not even between the binary genders that we use as a base for describing ourselves. Every gender I've found is tied to that original binary concept, even if it's just used as a base. 

So I say I'm agender, but it's because I have no gender that can be described in language, not because I am genderless. And it's frustrating and alienating. I've never met anyone who's shared this feeling. Or, if I have, they haven't said anything about it. The linear form of Boy &lt;--------&gt; Girl we rely on to explain and understand different genders works for most people but it very, very much does not work for me. I looked up some other genders and none of them fit me. At all. So I did some research and came up with aliusgender (a-loose), a combination  of the latin word for other/another and gender. I like it a lot, personally. But I also get nervous I'll be told that I'm trying too hard to be unique, i wanna be a snowflake, ect. I've dealt with a lot of that bull, so its gotten to me before.

I have had gender dysphoria since 6th grade and I am now a freshman in college. I hope to finally bring it up with my therapist soon. It has caused me great distress and sadness, which in turn gives me guilt since I have an otherwise great life. I am very hesitant to attempt to transition to another gender since I know it can totally destroy my life. I also like many aspects of being male but there are definite times when I wish I wasn't. I don't really believe you should just transition because you are feminine. I enjoy some feminine things sometimes but this could just be a fetish.

5,2015-12-04 17:19:08,3vfqkn,3,8,"Okay so I'm probably going to come out a little sefish or unenthusiastic about this but I'm 20 years old now, wanted to be a girl all of my life (had the usual growing up in a family of females, wore their clothes a lot yadda yadda) but only very recently have I actually had the guts to tell my grandparent (who then told my mother) about wanting to be a female even though they knew pretty much because I'm not very subtle in where i put my female clothes lol. 

So I've been to the doctors, had blood tests, sent out the reccomendation all fine, but as I already knew I've just been told there's at least a 3 and a half year waiting list (in the UK) for HRT and the only reason I've forced myself to come out to my parents about changing is because I'm getting more and more depressed as time goes on being male.

I know I'll maybe get advice such as ""just dress and act feminine for the 3 years theres nothing you can really do"" but I am obsessed with cute things and asian fashion, so being a cute female would be my absolute dream come true, I can't really imagine the masculine effects my body would gain in the next 3 years not to mention if I am to grow any more (I'm around 6ft now) I almost feel as if I wouldn't make it 3 more years which is quite a scary thought.

Any advice, thoughts or tips on climbing up this waiting list ultra fast? or maybe if I should look at contacting different gender clinics in my region?

26,2015-12-15 20:05:35,3wzdul,4,6,"As I've come to get to know myself over the past few years I've noticed these tendencies of divulging into my female side come and go in waves. They flow up on my shore and excite me, driving me to do outlandish and absurd acts, and then they ebb away leaving me confused and distraught, not knowing who I am. Each time these emotions well up inside me I find myself pushing the limits further and further, not knowing where they will take me.

As Halloween approached a couple months ago (it had snuck up on me as always) I found that I didn't have a costume ready! I racked my brain trying to think of something clever, or maybe a great pop culture reference. But as the day approached I found that I had nothing to go with and not enough time to really make something great.

When I mentioned that to my friend that I didn't have a costume she told me I could borrow her 'Brick House' costume, which was a tight full body suit that looked like bricks laid out for a wall and a foam hat that looked like the roof to a house. Cute, I know.

So, deciding I didn't want to go without a costume, and completely obsessed with the idea of going out dressed up I agreed and went to pick up her costume.

After picking it up I went with my girlfriend to a friend's house to eat Chinese food and get dressed up. I put on my costume, stuffing up fake tits and such. Then my girlfriend put on make-up and I put on nail polish. When some of our other friends arrived there was another guy who had dressed up in a nurse's outfit. I was so thankful for this because it made me feel better about going the way I was. While he was going for 'dude in a nurse's outfit', I was going for broke trying to pass myself off as a woman as best I can. I felt extreme relief that he was going as well.

The bar we went to was hosting my friend's band, so naturally I knew most of the people there. When my friends saw me they couldn't help but laugh and I laughed with them. It was funny. My female friends, however, couldn't stop telling me how pretty I looked and that with a few modifications I could be completely passable. Their compliments made me feel so good, and after a few drinks and some dancing I felt myself sink into my female side, perhaps a bit too much.

I felt extremely feminine all night which was amazing. I could feels eyes on me wherever I went. Some were curious, some confused. Some people laughed, others scowled. No matter how anyone reacted to me, it felt great. Even the rednecks who looked like they wanted to take me to the back alley and beat me to hell for being who I am... even that felt good. I loved the way being so exposed made me feel. I felt like I had nothing to really hide from. I felt like it brought out my truest self and that it showed me who was real, kind, and compassionate, and who wasn't. I may have ensconced myself in my female role a little too much, and may have shown a little too much.

Back at our friend's house while smoking jazz cigarettes on the back porch we relived the night. Mostly everyone had taken off their costumes, but as for me, I kept mine on. I wanted to live this feeling out for as long as I could while I was comfortable with it.

While talking to a friend of mine she couldn't stop telling me that she ""could only see the feminine side of me"" and that she thought I was very pretty. She was surprised in me for doing this, most people probably wouldn't expect if from me, however when they know, it makes sense. She kept asking me if I'd ever felt like I should have been a woman and a hundred other similar questions, and I was truthful with her.

At another point in the night another girl stopped mid conversation and said, ""Christina, don't you lie to me, you like this!"" Before a response from myself was delivered, the focus of everyone in the room drifted to some other topic, leaving me not having to answer.

Being 'outed' by those two girls was a moment I wish I could have gone back to. I felt so ready to just let everything about me out right then and their, but I held back and let the attention fall off of myself. I told myself in the following days that I should connect with those two girls and really tell them everything, but I never did. I felt the momentum had passed, and that I was in a lull again. Now there is nothing to do but to wait for the ebbing tides to turn and for my femininity to well up once more.

They flow up on my shore and excite me, driving me to do outlandish and absurd acts, and then they ebb away leaving me confused and distraught, not knowing who I am. Each time these emotions well up inside me I find myself pushing the limits further and further, not knowing where they will take me.\n\nAs Halloween approached a couple months ago (it had snuck up on me as always) I found that I didn\'t have a costume ready! I racked my brain trying to think of something clever, or maybe a great pop culture reference. But as the day approached I found that I had nothing to go with and not enough time to really make something great.\n\nWhen I mentioned that to my friend that I didn\'t have a costume she told me I could borrow her \'Brick House\' costume, which was a tight full body suit that looked like bricks laid out for a wall and a foam hat that looked like the roof to a house. Cute, I know.\n\nSo, deciding I didn\'t want to go without a costume, and completely obsessed with the idea of going out dressed up I agreed and went to pick up her costume.\n\nAfter picking it up I went with my girlfriend to a friend\'s house to eat Chinese food and get dressed up. I put on my costume, stuffing up fake tits and such. Then my girlfriend put on make-up and I put on nail polish. When some of our other friends arrived there was another guy who had dressed up in a nurse\'s outfit. I was so thankful for this because it made me feel better about going the way I was. While he was going for \'dude in a nurse\'s outfit\', I was going for broke trying to pass myself off as a woman as best I can. I felt extreme relief that he was going as well.\n\nThe bar we went to was hosting my friend\'s band, so naturally I knew most of the people there. When my friends saw me they couldn\'t help but laugh and I laughed with them. It was funny. My female friends, however, couldn\'t stop telling me how pretty I looked and that with a few modifications I could be completely passable. Their compliments made me feel so good, and after a few drinks and some dancing I felt myself sink into my female side, perhaps a bit too much.\n\nI felt extremely feminine all night which was amazing. I could feels eyes on me wherever I went. Some were curious, some confused. Some people laughed, others scowled. No matter how anyone reacted to me, it felt great. Even the rednecks who looked like they wanted to take me to the back alley and beat me to hell for being who I am... even that felt good. I loved the way being so exposed made me feel. I felt like I had nothing to really hide from. I felt like it brought out my truest self and that it showed me who was real, kind, and compassionate, and who wasn\'t. I may have ensconced myself in my female role a little too much, and may have shown a little too much.\n\nBack at our friend\'s house while smoking jazz cigarettes on the back porch we relived the night.

29,2015-12-16 10:42:18,3x2d38,5,5,"Okay... So, I'm sure this has come up before, but:

I have no idea if I'm transgender or maybe should just be diagnosed with transvestic fetishism. 

A lot of the time, it feels like dressing up (always in the house) is primarily sexual. I dress up as a woman, masturbate, then it's over. I'll do the same the next day, and so on, for maybe a month or so until the ""urge"" goes away. During this time I'll typically shave my whole body. Then, stupidly, I'll throw away all my clothes and breast forms and makeup. It gets expensive. I do all this, then find the urge coming back anywhere from 3-6 months. 

Even when I don't have an active urge, though, I find myself admiring women. It's sort of funny, because I have a dual train of thought going through my head: 1. Oh my god, she's gorgeous, I want to have sex with her and 2. Oh my god she's gorgeous, I'm so jealous of her I wish we could swap bodies. Very weird feeling. I'll usually get those pangs daily (though not always consciously).

So I guess I'm just confused. It feels like 70-80 percent of me thinks this is just a sexual thing. But the remaining 20-30 percent isn't so sure, and finds herself looking at /r/transtimelines wistfully or wishing that herbal pills actually did anything for breast growth. I got a blood test done at the behest of my therapist to see what my estrogen and testosterone levels were, it came back that I had normal T levels, and my estrogen was really high for a male. And frankly that's what it feels like, like there's a Jekyl and Hyde going on in my brain sometimes. (Sidenote: this was a few years ago when I was in the military... the urges died down and I moved, therefore the therapist and I didn't really get to discuss this for more than a few months)

Here's another thing that makes me think that it's not exactly sexual (or maybe it is, i'm no psychologist): when I was growing up, you know how your older sisters/cousins/whatever would dress you up as a girl? Well, I got very good at manipulating these girls into doing that ""against my will"" so I could keep my dignity, but I secretly loved it. In first grade I would play this game with this girl where we would go to the library and pullout the biggest books we could find and pretend we were casting spells to change bodies. I remember in the fourth grade, I went to the bathroom and tried to stick a toilet paper roll in my pants to get the ""flat"" look girls had. These things can't be sexual, right?

I tried once to get dressed up in front of a very good friend at her house and dance femininely, but I felt so awkward and weird that I didn't dress after that for about 2 years. Which makes me feel like I'm obviously not transgender. But man, there's a lot of evidence. I just don't know.

Is there like a litmus test? Something I can do? To help let me decide one way or the other. I know in the end only I can really *know* but it's so maddening and I need help.

I am born male, and I came out as pansexual a year ago. Both my parents were livid, but fortunately had amazing friends at the time. 

I can remember all the way back to when I was 8 years old, that whenever me and my friends was outside playing star wars - I always got to be princess Leia. Just like in the movies I got my friends to rescue me. It wasn´t until much later I connected two-and-two to my sexuality. 

Now at 17 years of age, soon 18, I´ve started to grow frustrated and bitter. It is the weirdest thing. It is not envy, it is straight up jealousy of women. Whenever I read twoxchromosomes here on reddit - I get so jealous that when I´m done reading that I actually become angry. Though not sure at what. 
I could be reading an article about the vagina, and the menstruation that comes along with it - and I am still triggered. It doesn´t matter the subject.

My ex is a male, though I am currently in an relationship with a female. Sometimes when we´re having sex, this jealousy and bitterness sneaks up on me. Even in the most intimate of moments, although not always. I am jealous of her vagina, her curves, her hair and everything feminine about her. I wish I could be as cute as her and be a real girl. 

I´ve crossdressed for something around 3 years secretively at home, although I have until recently wore exclusively girls clothes everyday. I changed my wardrobe from girls clothes to male clothes because I gave up on being pretty, and realized I would never be as cute as ""the real girls"". I´ll always be stuck looking like a male, awkwardly engrossed in girls clothes. Sorry if that offended anyone, but I am led to believe that this is where some of the bitterness comes from. The fact that I will never be born a female.   

At this point I don´t even know what my question is anymore. Whenever I am alone, and truly feel free to be whom I want to be, instead of the one who society has constructed me to be; I get these thoughts. The thoughts of a life in a woman´s mind, and body. Whenever I am put in a social situation these thoughts usually don´t spring to mind. 

If I was given the ability to go back in time and be born a female, I would say yes - but the thought about losing my current girlfriend makes me terrified. We were best friends for 9 months, and at certain point in time I kissed her accidentally while thinking about doing it; we´ve been together since and we´re inseparable. 

I would really appreciate if I got a little response, and if anyone has been in the same situation it would be nice to hear from you that I am not alone.

51,2015-12-29 08:29:19,3ymw4r,2,8,"This is going to be a bit long, but here it is:

A very close high school friend of mine is a trans woman who began transitioning about a year ago, she currently lives across the country from me (in the same city as one of our friends) and I'm very concerned about her mental health and safety. Like me, she is in her early twenties and graduated college last spring. As of right now she is unemployed, does not have stable housing (is staying with friends), and does not have a clear path out of this situation. According to my other friend, she has been getting by through the kindness of friends and by shacking up with strangers she's met via tinder and whatnot. Obviously, this is not a stable situation for her and my friend and I are incredibly concerned about this.

On top of this, my friend and I are very worried about her mental state. Last spring, she was committed to a psychiatric facility for what she described as a ""break from reality"", and my friend has stated that in person she appears to be manic, somewhat out of touch with reality, and generally not acting like herself. From my interactions with her online and over the phone, I tend to agree (based on admittedly limited information).

She has a college degree from a very prestigious school, has good work history, is very smart, and comes from an economically stable family. Transphobia aside (and that's a big aside), she is very well equipped to make a stable living for herself. My friend and I are both unemployed, so we can't give her financial support, and the responsibility to help her obviously lies with her family.

However, the problem is that (according to her) her family is totally unsupportive. Her mother is somewhat accepting, but has not accepted her trans identity; Her sister has totally rejected her trans identity; and her father has become substance-dependent and emotionally unstable because of his transphobic reaction to her coming out. As a result of her father's toxic reaction to her, her parents' marriage has been breaking down as well. 

But based on her shaky mental state, my friend and I are not entirely sure about the family story. She has had a tendency to lie in the past (including details about her family) as well, which adds to the problem. This also seems to be very out of character for her family, which by prior judgements was a stable, supportive, and progressive family (of course, abusive and intolerant family dynamics can hide beneath this veneer). This has made us question how much of the rift between her and her family has to do with their rejection of her, or her rejection of them.

We're really worried, and we want to talk to her family about the seriousness of her (tragically common) situation. And on the chance that the story about her family isn't entirely true, and they may not be as fucked as she's said, we want them to help her out (because she's their fucking child). 

I don't want to stir up the family situation any more, and put her or her family members at risk by contacting her parents about this directly (as they, mostly her father, seem to be the source of the problem). So, as imperfect as it may be, I want to talk to her sister about what the family situation is; and based on this information, make a judgement about whether or not to contact her parents). Obviously, I would want to have this conversation under complete confidentiality and I wouldn't reveal any details that might compromise my friends safety or mental well being (contact info, location, etc).

So, I'd come across the term ""aporagender"" while browsing Tumblr, and I fell into a rabbit hole of Genderqueer blogs and Wikipedia articles on the topic. Of course, I emerged no wiser and filled with more questions. However, I think there's something that could clear up a lot of my confusion, which is learning how the Genderqueer community defines the word ""gender.""

Before my research, I'd used the word interchangeably with sex, rather than a differentiation between masculinity and femininity as it's been apparently used for the past 40-some-odd years. I'm getting more pieces, but I'm having problems making them fit (which is probably a problem in itself, thinking about it). 

Example: I read an aporagendered person does not identify as male or female or anything in-between, but still feel gendered. By gendered, does this person perhaps mean they don't fit in with any social roles but their own, or they don't fit in with any sex?

Any comments on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!

**EDIT**: *I really appreciate the responses I got here. I've definitely learned some new things. One of the things I've learned is, in spite of most of the commenters saying there was no concrete and/or tangible ""genderqueer community,"" everyone's practically on the same page as far as defining gender. You guys are a lot more cohesive than you think, which was fun to accidentally discover.*

I'm so lost right now. I know we can't hold people up on pedestals but I've still never had this happen before so I have no response to it.

I am agender, pansexual, poly, queer. I live in a rural area and have experienced as much harassment as anyone. I am ridiculed every day that I leave my house or worse. I'm not here to talk about that though.

I am not comfortable around people who say things like ""die cis scum"". When I hear people simply turn around the kinds of words that have been hurled at me every day and aim them at cis people it brings me no relief or pleasure. That said, I don't generally say anything about it because I simply remove myself from situations in most cases where that kind of discussion is happening.

A few days ago a transwoman brought this kind of language into a space where I didn't expect it or feel it was appropriate. It is not a space about gender issues. So I said something, just about the fact that this kind of language isn't comfortable for me and that I didn't feel it was appropriate to throw that kind of speech around very publicly in a space that is about broader sexual issues with a lot of cis people in it.

I was extremely polite but made it clear that I didn't feel it was appropriate to do what she was doing (claiming that all cis people shouldn't be allowed to speak on a variety of issues many of which do affect cis people, basically wanting to throw all cis people out of a group that, again, is about broad sexuality). As soon as I said something I was viciously attacked by her and several other people and told I was in league with the oppressor.

Then my own identity was called into question, even though my identity is known and should not be a question. Several people ganged up on me at this point and told me I was just a cis person looking for attention and all kinds of other stuff.

I'm shocked and hurt than a transwoman would belittle/question my identity. I don't think I'm looking for advice, I just don't know who I can even talk to about this. One of my safest spaces (or so I thought) has been shattered, and by someone I just assumed would know better.

By the time I go I will have come out publicly as GQ. Most of the theater I go to is like storefront theater, where casual dress is totally fine. This feels like it would require something fancier.

I've never been good at fancy. When I identified as a man and I tried to dress up I always looked sort of frumpy. I'm afraid that trying to dress femme and fancy will produce the same results. But this could also just be anxiety talking. (My being overweight doesn't help either.)

I have a consultation with my PCP scheduled, but it seems like it will be unlikely that she'll understand. I have a consultation with my dentist scheduled too.




I'm considering discontinuing my IUD, which gives me levonorgestrel (a progestin with ""high androgenic activity"" according to not-scientific-appearing publications), because I think it might be causing my terrifying receding gumline. I don't actually need birth control because I don't have that kind of sex.

I like having hair. I don't want to go back to being depressed. **There is no certainty in anything and no guidance, it seems.** I'm worried. Do I go to an endocrinologist to talk about mood? I've never been to one. I had my thyroid checked out back in the crazy days and it was fine. If I went to one, would they just refer me back to a psychiatrist?

75,2015-12-17 16:20:03,3x89et,14,8,"Hi, I hope this is the place to seek this kind of advice, redirect me if necessary.
Few months ago I realized that I’m gender fluid. But I do have a problem, for over 18 years I lived as a male in a conservative christian family. I was only able to finally realize who I am, because at that point (2 years ago, I’m 20 now) I moved out, became atheist, and had the opportunity to think about anything LGBTQ from and different perspective. 

Unfortunately those 18 years of anti-gay propaganda left a huge scar on my mind, there is a large part of me that still says it’s all wrong, it’s not right, it’s a sin, it’s evil and that no matter what I read and say I was born with a penis, so I’m male and nothing else. That’s on top of bullying and self deprecation between ages of 12-16 when I guess I first started to realize I’m not *just* male, but forced myself to be as masculine as I could.

I don’t know how many of you are or were religious, but I no longer believe in the existence of any god. Even if there is something more out there, the last thing on it’s mind would be what I wear and how I style my hair. But while I had no problem breaking many other rules and commandments, I still fear that how I dress, style my hair and what pronouns I use is exactly the one reason I will be punished for eternity.

This also causes a lot of stress now, if I had to put numbers to it I’m male about 60% of the time, while female only 10%, the rest of the time I’m in between genders or I don’t feel like any. But when I do feel not-male, and especially when I feel feminine, I tend to hide it, forcing myself to stop playing with my hair and staying in my room until my gender changes again. I’m not hiding from others though, I have not made a scene out of coming out, but with the changes I made to my appearance, the way I conduct myself and how I speak I know that if not already one day most people will realize I’m a bit different, I also never refer to myself as a man or male, but as a person or a human.  I’m hiding this because of the “I was male first” mentality, and I feel like if I could rid myself of it, I would not only have the courage to go out more, but the proportions of what and how often I am, would be different as well.

Will those thoughts ever go away? Can I be what I wanted to become for so long, without hating myself? Any suggestion how to undo and combat all those years of brainwashing is welcome.

82,2015-12-18 07:00:57,3xbfb8,7,7,"Hi /r/genderqueer!

You all seem nice and supportive so I figured I'd make an account just to post here. :) Sort of a throwaway but I might keep it around.

So, to keep things short, I'm AFAB and realized I am transgender about a month ago (after over a year of self reflection, examination, experimenting with labels, and experimenting with my gender performance)! Yay! This made me really, really happy, probably the happiest I've been in years. I felt like I found the missing part of myself. The first time I declared, ""I am transgender"" to my therapist I cried tears of joy. :')

A day passes and I'm still pretty happy, but quickly become depressed within a week. My baseline has changed from ""meh"" to ""happy,"" though. I smile when I think about being trans.

Then, I realize.. okay, so I know I'm trans. And trans is an umbrella term.

I'm trans, but I'm trans*what*? I have no idea. Up to this point, I had only heard about binary trans identities. Nonbinary was a very .. out there concept to me. Am I a transman? I don't know. When I think about being male, it makes me feel nauseous, and suicidal.. for some reason. I have no idea why. There's some little yellow flower of happiness in there, but it's so buried I can't see it. 

As for my identity: I guess right now I'm going with neutral because I'm figuring things out. I don't feel female but might feel male. I am 100% certain I am not female. 

To sum it up, my therapist has been a great help to me for over two years, for reasons unrelated to gender. But.. she didn't know the difference between gender identity and sexuality, misgendered and deadnamed her transman intern while telling me about him, and I feel that the two of us are at a strange point where she may not be able to help me anymore.

So, to end this rambling: does anyone have any resources to help me figure out the trans*what* part? I would like to see a gender therapist, but I am a very broke, poor, college student. The only reason I could see my current therapist is because my tuition already paid the fees.

Any advice is appreciated!!

I picked up a thing of lipstick and mascara, plus some eye shadow. I figured it was a good way to experiment with femme presentation while ""dressing up"" for the movie (and doing so in a way that didn't flaunt [the new safety rules](http://www.dailydot.com/geek/star-wars-force-awakens-movie-theater-costume-policy-guide/) a lot of theaters have for the movie).

So I put on some of the makeup and went out wearing a t-shirt and a kilt. I was supposed to meet my friends for dinner but I got there early so I killed some time at a bookstore. I met them for dinner a while later, we had some really great pizza, I gave them their Christmas presents (which they really seemed to like) and then we meandered over to the theater. It was a really great night so far.

And then we stood in line.

A woman came out of a showing, probably an earlier showtime for Star Wars. She was older, very WASP-y, and was there with her husband. My friends and I were there minding our business and she came up to me and one of my friends (who identifies as male but also paints his nails and dyes his hair bright colors) and said with this sort of vacant smile, ""are you two in costume?""

My friend said we're not and tried to politely nudge her along but she was like... not taking the hint. And kept asking (in a fairly non-aggressive but nonetheless *insistent* way) why I was dressed the way I was.

I didn't really say anything, just shrugs and head shakes, and my friend did most of the talking. But man, she really didn't want to let it go. Her husband did finally pull her away.

I dunno. I know I should've brushed it off but it made me feel really uncomfortable. She wasn't even mean or confrontational. She was just very clueless and didn't know how to take a hint.

And it sucks because that night was one of the happiest I've had all year (especially after the movie, holy wow did I love TFA) and apart from that episode the evening was unambiguously good. But there was that *one thing* that made me super uncomfortable. Thankfully that friend sensed what was going on with me and kinda talked me down before the movie started.

I realize I'm just overreacting and that I should just brush this off. I think I'm just anxious about coming out in a couple months and freaking out about going out in public while presenting as femme (or at least more openly queer), and the incident at the movie theater just kinda foregrounded a lot of the stuff I'm anxious about (even if the incident itself was fairly tame).

Thanks for listening. Hope y'all have a good holiday, even if ""good"" just means surviving in one piece.

118,2015-12-27 07:49:47,3ydnna,3,8,"Thank you for reading this. I could use some help and any at all would be appreciated. And I’m sorry I don’t know more about this stuff and if I'm being offensive or stupid.


First, I'm a 29 year old straight male. I feel like an old person struggling to understand a changing society. Ten to fifteen years ago, maybe it was where I lived, you never heard about any of this gender stuff. You were straight, gay, trans, or had a fetish. That was it.


In the last five years, I started hearing more about different non-binary(?) genders, but it first reached me via hearing about tumblrinas on reddit and always came across with negative connotations. Like Mr. Garrison on south park, going gay, trans, and then gay again while still being trans. That sort of vibe, maybe a bad example.


The situations could be funny, yet it always felt mocking as if these people were making it up and the concept itself was ridiculous. I had no real opinion, except ""Yeah, some people might make stuff up for attention or focus on it too much, and maybe some of it is a cultural fad I don’t know, but I’m sure it’s also 100% legit and very real thing like being gay that deserves support and understanding."" It was always an uncomfortable mix with mostly just not understanding. 


I knew in my heart there was more to it. But I kind of avoided thinking about it or applying it to myself.


Then a show came out. Steven Universe. And my own universe shattered. I realized I was a Pearl. Yes, absolutely. The similarities are often literal. Love for giant, giant women and everything.


I'm a straight male and I'm into girls who look like girls. BUT I'm not attracted to women being submissive and males being dominant. Gender roles are completely backwards for me to the point of ""normal"" being extremely uncomfortable. Like, I want to be the girl in the relationship, if that even makes sense. I love baking, cleaning, decorating, homemaking, and teaching! I’m like a 1950s housewife and mom. And in the bedroom I want my hair pulled and to feel claimed, owned. I'm extremely emotional, empathetic, and I often give my male friends relationship advice (that has landed them in long term relationships) based on WHAT I WOULD WANT DONE TO MYSELF. I’m literally telling my male friends how to romance me. It’s weird how different they are. That should make me think, right?


I don’t have an urge to dress like a girl, but I keep myself shaved and I hate body hair on myself as hair for the most part is icky. Thankfully my hair is super blonde and so it looks like I don’t even have any. I want to look pretty, but not look exactly like a girl because that’s what I’m attracted to. 


Yet I’m extremely envious of girls because they get to have all the fun with makeup and clothes!! Guy stuff is so incredibly boring. So in past relationships I would take my GF shopping, do her makeup, and express and enjoy this vicariously through her. But because I don’t want to dress like a girl like I see other trans folk do, I feel my feminine feelings must be less legitimate. Or something. Maybe… I should try a little light makeup on myself...


I feel alone, isolated, confused, and very uncomfortable. I wonder if I'm doing this to myself. Like that I've warped myself somehow, and I'm making things hard for no reason. Like, I'm doing this to myself, I'm making this up. That all men maybe feel this way at some point, but it's their job to be the men. I should just be a dominant guy, the ""real man"" that most women want if I ever want to find someone (it’d be so much easier if I were gay, but I’m not!). Would I be faking it as a “real man”? Or just being who I naturally should be? Do I need to man up, because all men feel this way at some point, and that’s why the expression exists?


And I don't want others to think I'm submissive because I want to do less work, or have the other partner make all the decisions, it's not like that at all. I want an equal relationship, but I want to be the little spoon, the one on the bottom. If I were a woman I'd be a strong, independent woman. I’M STRONG IN THE REAL WAY and I wouldn’t hesitate to fight for freedom! But I'd still want my partner to be the dominant one. http://i.imgur.com/ZGNryqX.jpg


Even as I write this I'm thinking ""there's no way you genuinely can feel this way, this is all in your head, just man up, you are a man, no man or woman will respect you like this. You're making your life needlessly difficult."" Can I respect myself like this? I’m kind of half out of the closet, but I’m confused if I’m in the closet, do I even need to tell others? Or am I pretending to be in a closet?


WHAT AM I DOING!?


I'm so confused. What am I? Are there others like me? AND HOW DO YOU DATE LIKE THIS?! I created an “honest” OkCupid profile and going through profile after profile of women who want ""a tall, real man who knows how to treat a women"" yet are 90%+ is so incredibly depressing it makes me want to just bottle up all this and be that “man.” It fuels the whole ""See, you're doing this to yourself and self-sabotaging"" I'm just embarrassed when they visit my profile. If there is a girl out there who would fit as my other half, it must be like finding a needle in a haystack and I'm sure there are more people looking for these needles than there are needles.

Haaaaaaalllllppppppp! Any advice at all is greatly appreciated. Thank you!",genderqueer,What am I? What’s going on? Is this in my head? Help!,1451227787.0,"{'created_utc': 1451202587, 'id': '3ydnna', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 8, 'selftext': 'Thank you for reading this. I could use some help and any at all would be appreciated. And I’m sorry I don’t know more about this stuff and if I\'m being offensive or stupid.\n\n\nFirst, I\'m a 29 year old straight male. I feel like an old person struggling to understand a changing society. Ten to fifteen years ago, maybe it was where I lived, you never heard about any of this gender stuff. You were straight, gay, trans, or had a fetish. That was it.\n\n\nIn the last five years, I started hearing more about different non-binary(?) genders, but it first reached me via hearing about tumblrinas on reddit and always came across with negative connotations. Like Mr. Garrison on south park, going gay, trans, and then gay again while still being trans. That sort of vibe, maybe a bad example.\n\n\nThe situations could be funny, yet it always felt mocking as if these people were making it up and the concept itself was ridiculous. I had no real opinion, except ""Yeah, some people might make stuff up for attention or focus on it too much, and maybe some of it is a cultural fad I don’t know, but I’m sure it’s also 100% legit and very real thing like being gay that deserves support and understanding."" It was always an uncomfortable mix with mostly just not understanding. \n\n\nI knew in my heart there was more to it. But I kind of avoided thinking about it or applying it to myself.\n\n\nThen a show came out. Steven Universe. And my own universe shattered. I realized I was a Pearl. Yes, absolutely. The similarities are often literal. Love for giant, giant women and everything.\n\n\nI\'m a straight male and I\'m into girls who look like girls. BUT I\'m not attracted to women being submissive and males being dominant. Gender roles are completely backwards for me to the point of ""normal"" being extremely uncomfortable. Like, I want to be the girl in the relationship, if that even makes sense. I love baking, cleaning, decorating, homemaking, and teaching! I’m like a 1950s housewife and mom. And in the bedroom I want my hair pulled and to feel claimed, owned. I\'m extremely emotional, empathetic, and I often give my male friends relationship advice (that has landed them in long term relationships) based on WHAT I WOULD WANT DONE TO MYSELF. I’m literally telling my male friends how to romance me. It’s weird how different they are. That should make me think, right?\n\n\nI don’t have an urge to dress like a girl, but I keep myself shaved and I hate body hair on myself as hair for the most part is icky. Thankfully my hair is super blonde and so it looks like I don’t even have any. I want to look pretty, but not look exactly like a girl because that’s what I’m attracted to. \n\n\nYet I’m extremely envious of girls because they get to have all the fun with makeup and clothes!! Guy stuff is so incredibly boring. So in past relationships I would take my GF shopping, do her makeup, and express and enjoy this vicariously through her. But because I don’t want to dress like a girl like I see other trans folk do, I feel my feminine feelings must be less legitimate. Or something. Maybe… I should try a little light makeup on myself...\n\n\nI feel alone, isolated, confused, and very uncomfortable. I wonder if I\'m doing this to myself. Like that I\'ve warped myself somehow, and I\'m making things hard for no reason. Like, I\'m doing this to myself, I\'m making this up. That all men maybe feel this way at some point, but it\'s their job to be the men. I should just be a dominant guy, the ""real man"" that most women want if I ever want to find someone (it’d be so much easier if I were gay, but I’m not!). Would I be faking it as a “real man”? Or just being who I naturally should be? Do I need to man up, because all men feel this way at some point, and that’s why the expression exists?\n\n\nAnd I don\'t want others to think I\'m submissive because I want to do less work, or have the other partner make all the decisions, it\'s not like that at all. I want an equal relationship, but I want to be the little spoon, the one on the bottom. If I were a woman I\'d be a strong, independent woman. I’M STRONG IN THE REAL WAY and I wouldn’t hesitate to fight for freedom! But I\'d still want my partner to be the dominant one. http://i.imgur.com/ZGNryqX.jpg\n\n\nEven as I write this I\'m thinking ""there\'s no way you genuinely can feel this way, this is all in your head, just man up, you are a man, no man or woman will respect you like this. You\'re making your life needlessly difficult."" Can I respect myself like this? I’m kind of half out of the closet, but I’m confused if I’m in the closet, do I even need to tell others? Or am I pretending to be in a closet?\n\n\nWHAT AM I DOING!?\n\n\nI\'m so confused. What am I? Are there others like me? AND HOW DO YOU DATE LIKE THIS?! I created an “honest” OkCupid profile and going through profile after profile of women who want ""a tall, real man who knows how to treat a women"" yet are 90%+ is so incredibly depressing it makes me want to just bottle up all this and be that “man.” It fuels the whole ""See, you\'re doing this to yourself and self-sabotaging"" I\'m just embarrassed when they visit my profile. If there is a girl out there who would fit as my other half, it must be like finding a needle in a haystack and I\'m sure there are more people looking for these needles than there are needles. \n\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. I don’t have money or time for a therapist and I live in the middle of nowhere at the moment. I have to work through this on my own. I just want to know what I might be, or what I should do.\n\n\nHaaaaaaalllllppppppp! Any advice at all is greatly appreciated. Thank you!', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'What am I?

My 12 yr old came out to my wife and I last Christmas as being bisexual, saying she had known this for several years (she was 11 at the time)....she has since said that she identifies as genderfluid, male more often, and has asked to be called by a male name at home and by closest family and friends. She has recently started seeing a mental health therapist for issues of anxiety and anger management ( more anxiety than anger, her anger really just manifests with her little sister.) The therapist is also aware of her genderfluid identification, has worked with other young ppl in the same situation, and has given her some help in obtaining a free binder, and advised about the possibility of drugs to stop puberty. My daughter doesn't want to do any kind of drugs at this young age, so that is not proceeding.

She has said its not a phase, but I have since found out her best friend also identifies as genderfluid, and I'm not sure who was first to admit it to the other. I wonder if it's simply a confusion in coming into her sexuality at this point, and something she will grow out of.

The evidence mounts with every passing day and every bit of experimentation with girl mode and boy mode, but I don't wanna come to any conclusions yet.

I am DMAB but I have very androgenous features and body-type, and I already have long hair. I think I can pass in both girl mode and boy mode, with enough time and practice. I am trying to discover and face any internalised transphobia I can find, and so far, I've found little.

Overall, things seem stable on all fronts, right? Nothing too bad. But one thing that is distressing me deeply is this - Where do I fit in? 

I absolutely hate the idea of being called a cross-dresser. This is separate from my fears about passing as female - just the concept/prospect of being told I am a cross-dresser feels wrong to me, because it suggests that I am just a man wearing women's clothes. But, no, in girl mode, I am wearing women's clothes because I am a woman. Right? But them, am I also a man, when I am in boy mode?

I am bisexual, and I have never really worried about this sort of dichotomy there. If I am with a guy, I am in a ""gay relationship"", if I am with a girl, I am in a ""straight relationship."" But in both cases, I am still bi.

But here, if I am in girl mode, am I a woman? Or am I just genderfluid, no matter whether I am presenting as a man or a woman? Am I ever actually a woman, or ever actually a man?

Neither?

I don't know. I don't know! Please tell me what you think.

Ps. Does it even matter what the technicality is? In a same sex relationship, I am *functionally gay* even though I am bi. By the same logic, is it not enough that I am *functionally a woman* in girl mode? But, even if I can accept that, will other women accept that?

18,2015-12-29 06:36:50,3ymlig,4,3,"I had to wait to write this until I had a dysphoric moment; it's hard to describe to myself when I feel female, but I guess that's part of the confusion. I am a fifteen year old female. I am very aware of the difference between sex, gender, presentation, and sexuality (though the subcategories of some seem muddled), and I believe I might have fluctuating sexual dysphoria.

I'd never had a problem with the label of ""girl"" as a child because it didn't actually separate me from boys too much. Even learning about female sexual characteristics didn't make me think ""this isn't me"". (I wanted to hurry to late teens and didn't care what came with it beyond more privileges, I guess.) Once the first bits of puberty rolled in I started to have actual crushes on some people, only later realizing that while I was seeing the boys as potential partners, there were certain girls with which I would have loved to have been together, had that been an option. Okay, some challenges to sexuality, but gender seemed stable, or at least not an issue like many fully trans people had at that age.

Possibly before, but clearly around fourteen, I seemed to split. It was almost spiritual in nature; it wasn't like suddenly I had a masculine side revealed, it was as if both the masculine and feminine parts of me had crystallized into something more than just moods and interests. I had two different attitudes and outlooks on life, and I could swear when I looked in the mirror they each had a different face. I was already female-presenting at this point so the most I could do on the days where to seemed to switch into a masculine self was incorporate some androgynous elements to feel a bit less like I was in drag. I'd wonder sometimes why I even have female genitalia, and certainly the male equipment would be better there? and around this time I thought that it couldn't just be some woo I had created.

I started to take birth control this year due to pretty debilitating cramps and irregular cycles, which seemed to indicate my hormones were off (along with the feeling like a man more than the average female, but I wasn't going to say something like that when I had watched as my mom fill in ""heterosexual"" on the gyne patient sheet). Now that I have the estrogen dosages figured out somewhat, usually I'm comfortable in my body. But even if I've not missed a morning in weeks, I'll occasionally have flares of ""male-ness"", to the point of feeling more like a gay man than a woman when I'm with my boyfriend.

I am currently still female-presenting and haven't really told anyone how I feel. It'd be way too much of a hassle to switch to masculine-presenting, but while it'd leave out my feminine aspects and I wouldn't want to be sterile, I don't think I would have any more dysphoria than I do now if a total sex changes was more than hypothetical (that is to say, a fortunately low amount). More often it seems like the two sides are present together, for whatever reason, yet I still feel polarized at times. I haven't talked to my therapist because I don't know if he even handles such situations and so far the meetings have been with my mother present, so I don't have a professional opinion.

**Basically:** Does this seem abnormal in terms of typical development? Should I just continue to seem like a totally cis female and hope the hormones and feelings sort themselves out in the end, or would it be better to appear more androgynous and masculine as well to appeal to every bit of me at all times?",genderfluid,Questioning My Experiences,1451396210.0,"{'created_utc': 1451371010, 'id': '3ymlig', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 3, 'selftext': 'I had to wait to write this until I had a dysphoric moment; it\'s hard to describe to myself when I feel female, but I guess that\'s part of the confusion.
