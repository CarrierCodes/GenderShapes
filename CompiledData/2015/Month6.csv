My goal is for people to be unsure whether I am male or female. My hair is naturally thick wavy/curly, its just short at the moment. I'm also going to be getting glasses soon, most likely [these ones](https://www.etsy.com/listing/194401973/handmade-vintage-bamboo-glasses?ref=shop_home_active_1). My wardrobe is super simple at the moment, just unisex v-necks of various colors and slim black jeans. I was considering short hair with long bangs.... could that maybe work? I am rather unsure as to what route I should take, and there's not really anybody I can talk to about this.

So please and thank you, any advice you have for a fellow non-binary fellow? :)

When I was 11 for a period of 6 months or so I became intensely depressed with being a boy.
I wanted to wear cute clothes and skirts, I wanted to act girly.

Yet I was a boy, and despite wanting long hair my parents would always cut it.

I didn't tell anyone, because I thought it would pass. Not only that, but I reasoned that I wasn't properly dysphoric, that I was probably just going through some phase or something.

Life went on. Every few months the depression and longing came back. Every time I reasoned I probably wasn't properly dysphoric, and that it would be insulting to trans people if I even tried to come out with these feelings - afterall I felt I still probably wasnt dysphoric, I can't explain why I just thought my situation wasnt dire and actual trans people went through something a lot worse. My phrasing is terrible, I'm sorry, but having never recounted this to someone before it's a little hard to phrase.

At 14 I made a decision. My childhood was gone, I reasoned I was too old and thus would never be able to be brought up as a girl and thus could never fit in as one. Furthermore, the very fact that I felt uncertain about whether I would be able to pass (behavior-wise) seemed to justify to myself that clearly couldn't be dysphoric, otherwise I would know how to act girly. 

I guess to an extent, I couldn't shake the feeling that I would never be a 'real' girl. Anyway, there were 'boy' things I enjoyed too, like climbing trees and video games, so my 14yo self assumed I can't have been right.

I was in the top classes at school and felt like, for whatever reason, that this couldnt be happening to me. That there were other things in my life. That somehow, my path was already decided.

So I tried to ignore it. And for 3 years, until I was 17, it worked.

Well, Im 18. I've never managed to engage or sustain in romantic relationships. The depression and longing comes back every few weeks now and lasts for several days, yet I still can't seem to be convinced I'm dysphoric. I still can't seem to comprehend this is happening to me. That I could be a girl. Even if I was, surely it's too late? I would never fit in? 

Yet still every night I wish I had just been born as one.

I am a 15 year old male and throughout my life, I was fairly certain that I was cis. However, starting a few years ago, my certainty is wavering. Although people outside my mind may not know it, I have wonderings and feelings and perhaps even longings. 

I've wondered for years about what it would be like to be female, not burning desires, but a recurring thought I can't shake loose. I've sometimes gone into my sister's closet and tried on some of her clothes. Sometimes, it's for sexual reasons, but other times, I'll just sit there. Sit there in a dress or yoga pants or perhaps a swimsuit. Just chilling. To my surprise, it was nice to be able to chill in those clothes. I've thought ""maybe I should try crossdressing in public"" or ""maybe I should transition when I'm older"" (no way in h--l I'm even broaching that topic around my parents). or even ""maybe I *should* become a girl"". 

Even though I have these thoughts, I still don't feel as though I am trans. I just brush it off as just me being curious, as is my nature. I still am rather masculine, even though not like what I've come to expect as ""most boys"" (the only kinds of males I know in my school are either hyper-masculine sports-types or politically minded, accelerated classes intellegentsia (I would fall in the latter category)). I still enjoy many traditionally masculine things and eschew traditionally female ones. 

I don't feel like I am supposed to be a female. I don't feel like I already am one that's just trapped in the wrong body. I understand that I am a male, but think perhaps I should be female. If I were any female, I'd certainly be more tomboy than girly girl and I still find females attractive, but maybe I'm just a tomboy lesbian rather than a straight cis male. But maybe I'm not and I just have these strange curiosities.

**Background:** I've been questioning my gender and identity for a while now, the strongest was during senior year of high school. Over that summer, I read up on personal stories, news from the community, etc.. Then college starts, an I get my first girlfriend. She liked referring to me as her boyfriend, and I didn't have a problem with that, so I never brought it up. Then, near the end of the semester, I shaved my legs, something that I never did before, something that makes me feel really good, and more comfortable, and yes, feminine. And I talked with her about it before, and she kept saying things like, ""You don't have to,"" and ""it's not easy, y'know,"" to discourage me, but politely. But after I shaved, she liked it, and was really turned on. And she had the same reaction when I talked with her, very briefly, about questioning my gender. 

**Situation:** last night, I tried to articulate how I felt over text and I waited for her response in the morning. Come morning, she talks to me about it, and is very supportive, talking about letting me try on her clothes, and helping me do my makeup and nails when I'm female. And she was more than supportive, she was also really, really turned on. More turned on than by thinking of me as a guy, I think.

Until recently I actually had no idea there was a difference between gender and sex, and I thought gender roles were just something women did and men did and that was it, no straying from that path.

I'm noticing a lot of binary trans people in online trans communities saying things they would have heard not even two decades ago from cis people.

""Well you can't expect someone to ask for your/to use those pronouns."" 

""Well people/I just don't understand it so you can't blame them/me for saying the wrong thing. You need to understand where they are/I'm coming from."" 

Just bullshit like that. Stuff that quietly insinuates your identity is invalid or not worthy of respect. Using phrases like ""transtrender"" to describe nonbinary/genderqueer people. Continuing to use the wrong pronouns because oh it's so hard to remember to use they instead of he.

32,2015-06-05 19:21:19,38piu6,0,1,"So my whole life, I've struggled with gender.  When I was too young to buy my own clothes, I fought my parents tooth and nail about whether I'd get clothes from the boys or girls section.  I hated that my brother got cool toys like Batman shaving cream and I got American Girl dolls.  As a child, you're pretty willfull and lacking a sense of self consciousness, and some of the first memories I have of becoming self conscious stem from being told I wasn't acting the way I was supposed to for my assigned sex* - don't play upstairs in that boy's bedroom alone with him, wear this type of underwear, go to a different bathroom than your friends (who were boys), wax/bleach my mustache and your underarms, your bra strap is showing, etc.

Now, I say sex, because of course as a kid, your parents and teachers and well-meaning adults describe this stuff to you in ""scientific"" terms, right? They say, this is a girl, this a boy, you have girl parts, this makes you a girl.  End of story.   So I grew up thinking being a girl was like having blue eyes or brown eyes.  And also like telling all the blue-eyed people that they had to use a  separate bathroom, or wear certain clothes, play with certain toys.  The gender binary was as evil to me as racism, a separate but equal system that must be abolished if I was ever going to live comfortably.  

Enter many years of dragging my mother into the boys' section and shamefully trying on pants that never fit right while she looked embarrassed for me.  Why couldn't girls have t-shirts that were looser and without stupid frills? What made cool Oxfords for ""guys"" and stupid heels for ""girls""?  I put my hair up into a greasy pony tail because I didn't like it long and hated the act of brushing through all the knots after a shower, and wore guys' shoes 2 sizes too big because they didn't sell small enough ones in the stores near my house and the idea of buying clothes on the internet wasn't something 12-year-old me knew how to do.  As my guy friends got older, I started getting shunned by them because I wasn't just ""not pretty"" or ""not stylish"" - I was a disaster.  Everyone was telling me how to be a ""pretty girl"" but it felt impossible to be that thing, not only because it didn't appeal to me, but because it was also just not compatible with many of my natural features.  And everywhere I turned a different sort of aesthetic seemed to evade me - it was ""ugly"" to be ""too butch"" and I was filled with shame for experimenting, and the stores never had clothes that fit me anyway.

Finally, I gave up.  I wanted to feel good about myself, for once, and feel attractive, and I had no idea how to do that while staying authentic to myself.  The clothes in the guys' section continued to not fit properly, I continued to receive messages from my parents/schoolmates/media/etc. that masculinity in AFAB people was gross and undesirable.  So I wore dresses and heels and looked at myself in the mirror and felt like I was in drag, but suddenly people were telling me I was beautiful for it.  I was intensely unhappy, but I was before, too. 

Enter...learning about trans people.  Learning that ""gender identity"" was something that you felt innately, from inside, not something that was assigned to you like a race because you had certain arbitrary features in common with other people of your sex/gender.  Suddenly, my world exploded a little, and not in a good way.  I was intensely intrigued, but also angry, at first.  Yes, I had wanted all my life to be seen as a ""boy"" - if that meant being able to be considered attractive even with short hair and facial hair, being able to shop in the sections of the stores I liked most, be friends with the people I wanted to be friends with and not feel like some invisible line in the sand divided us.  But it angered me that I had to say I WAS one, to get everything I wanted.  Like a black person having to insist they were white to use the same water fountain.  And by this point, I had grown to take a certain pride in being a girl, in weathering sexism and misogyny and the patriarchy, even if I didn't ""feel"" like a girl anymore than I felt ""white"". Also, people were taking T to grow the facial hair and leg hair and hard chin and facial features that I had spent years loathing because people hated me so much for being different for it? As long as these things were part of ""transitioning"" to being a ""male"" they were attractive and desirable, something to strive for and post timeline pictures about.  If they just ""were"".....well good luck. 

Yes, this is where the radfemmy in me came out.  I asked a thousand embarrassing and politically unpopular questions about being trans to my increasingly inpatient queer friends.  ""How do you feel your gender identity? How?"" I would demand.  They would say, ""I don't know. Cis people don't know.  You only know if your trans."" Great.  So I'm a ""girl"" internally, and it has nothing to do with all my vagina or my ovaries or chromosomes or the only thing had ever defined being a girl for me.

Eventually, the anger around trans issues faded.  I saw trans people everywhere breaking down barriers for me as a gender nonconforming person - a non binary person rocking femininity and a beard,  a trans man rocking a button down and jeans and jacked arms and being 5'1"", a beautiful trans woman with a hard/large chin.  I saw that as curious as I was, it wasn't helpful to anyone - not even me - to question trans identities.  Trans people were on my side.  We were having to fight a lot of the same battles, and break down a lot of the same walls.

But my own confusion over my gender remains.  It remains tied up in years of shame I'm sure I'll never shed about certain natural features that aren't seen as womanly or beautiful, years of constructing my identity as a ""woman"" around only experiences of marginalization and what's in my pants.  I've picked up tricks around where to buy ""masculine"" clothes that fit better, and have in the last year cut my hair for the first time ever, and shed some of the more feminine things that I had forced myself to ""like"" and ""feel beautiful"" in.  But I still look in the mirror and see someone unattractive. My girlfriend didn't assume my gender identity at first, and would call me ""wildly attractive"" instead of gendered terms like ""handsome"" and ""beautiful"" and I liked it for awhile...but one day she looked at old pictures of me on Facebook when I was playing up the femme thing, and said that I was ""very pretty""  back then.  It felt like a punch to the gut, and so I said, ""Am I not pretty now?"" She's started calling me beautiful but now I cringe every time.  I feel like I'll never be comfortable in this world as I am, but that there's nothing to ""transition"" to or ""become"".  I don't know if I'm happier now dressing more masculine, because I also feel less ""sexy"" and ""desirable"" again.  I'm afraid I'll always feel ugly and out of place in my own body.

33,2015-06-05 21:10:03,38pyi0,2,17,"My sibling (FAAB) came out as genderqueer very recently. I guess I'm wondering how I can be the best sibling to them and how to help both my sibling and the rest of my family adjust to this smoothly.

I came out to them via drunk text a few months ago (I am cisgender but queer) and in return they came out to me. I accepted that without a second thought and I am 100% supportive of who my sibling is. Recently they came out to our parents and on facebook.

I have not come out to my parents and have no plans to do so in the near future so I am immensely proud of my sibling for having that courage. I know that my mother loves ~~her~~ them so much and is supportive but she is struggling with it. On the phone today she mentioned something along the lines of ""I don't have two daughters anymore"" and it is obvious that this was a huge surprise to her. I want to help my mother understand better and help her adjust to it so that my sibling can feel completely accepted in their own home.

My sibling has been depressed for at least the last year and I'm sure that struggling with their gender played a part in that. On the bright side they are on antidepressants and in therapy and it seems to really be helping.

So I guess I'm not sure how else I can help my sibling other than being there for them and making sure they know that I love and support them no matter what. I am still slipping up with pronouns occasionally but I'm trying my best.

And I also want to know how I can help my parents. They are immigrants from a very conservative part of the world and although they are very accepting of queer people I don't think they know how to handle having a queer child.

If it matters at all my sibling is still in high school for at least another year and will probably be living at home for at least the next 3-4 years.

I'm AFAB and I've been genderqueer for nearly my entire life without ever acknowledging it. I learned fairly early what a transgender person is, as opposed to cisgender. I never felt fully male, so passed off my discomfort and dysphoria as normal.

Fast forward, and I'm 18 years old, on the cusp of a new beginning, one I'm hoping will be as the real me. I only came out to myself and my friends in March, but I feel ready to tell my parents.  I've acquired some make clothing, a binder is on the way... And I'm doing research into packers for male days. I've changed my pronouns and officially go as my nickname for my birth name (it works both ways) and all I have left to do in this huge transition is tell my parents, and I'm so scared.

They even had trouble accepting that I was bisexual. Now mind you they were supportive and great about it, they just had a hard time wrapping their heads around it. They also mentioned in their shock that I shouldn't wave it in people's faces or attend pride because it was unnecessary flamboyancy. *Queue human and gay rights rage* But seriously... They aren't intolerant... Just a bit uneducated and uncomfortable with half naked people parading around in the streets. (Lol). But to my main point:

How do I come out to them? Should I do it in a creative or funny way and then educate them on what it means to be genderfluid? How much do I tell them? How do I explain how important it is for them to call me they/them? I'm just very vulnerable right now and I want to seek my dads help in dressing myself. I'm just so scared they'll reject my identity as a phase or worse, that it doesn't exist. If anyone has any advice...

So sorry if this post seems kinda out of place or something.

So basically this is what the experiment is: I went on Steam and changed my name to a somewhat female name ""A Random Vixen"" To see how my mind would react to people thinking of me as female. 

I guess you can kinda consider it exploring the more feminine (or as feminine as a tomboy can get heh) side of me where I've explored and discovered a lot of things I didn't know about myself: in video games. And honestly, it felt pretty awesome having people think of me as female. I even unleashed a side of me I haven't seen in a loooong time: the funny, joking crazy person that has seemed to have been locked away somewhere until I did this. 

I did the same thing in a couple other places that allowed username changes, and somehow I started to feel less stressed somehow. 

After all of that I decided to run a small experiment within the current one. That experiment was to go back to Steam and change my username back to my previous, masculine sounding name.

The results: Didn't like it. At all. That less serious side of me disappeared and was replaced with the same ole' dark side that's led me to some dark places in life. It just didn't feel... right I guess you could say. It didn't feel wrong, but it felt off...

I changed it back to A Random Vixen immediately, and all the stress I could feel building up in me just melted away.

I decided to keep my username on Steam as A Random Vixen and might work on re-making an account on another site to sorta fit my more feminine side, because I feel better with people seeing me as a female than a male.

Sorry if this was typed completely incoherently, it's almost 5 in the morning on my end (insomnia is fun hahah), and I hope the people of r/genderqueer don't mind me sharing my odd experiment.

“No I’m not asking you to hurt yourself”

And just continued on the track of that she would not watch as I ruined my life, that I needed to go see someone about this.

85,2015-06-13 14:36:14,39pjyx,10,10,"So, as a disclaimer this is going to be rambly. I just feel like I've got to get this off my chest because right now it's just too much and I'm upset and I can't really talk to anyone I know irl.

I'm afab and genderfluid, and finally I worked up the courage to tell my therapist about it, and she was very understanding and great, and she said that she takes me seriously and that I didn't have to worry about her thinking that it's just a phase or anything like that. Anyway, I told her that I regularly experience doubt regarding this. I'm really good at getting in my own head and messing with myself and I think the doubt comes from two things. One being that I've found ways to avoid dysphoria. I've learnt to think that I've got a healthy body, and that's really all I could ask for. And then I distract myself from thinking about it any further. I also think it's because I really would like to be cis, so therefore I constantly challenge myself and push myself into thinking that in reality I am female. It's just body insecurities etc... I also think that my father's words got to me. I tried telling him about genderfluidity and he said ""Well, it doesn't really matter what you feel like, does it? I mean you'll always be 100% female. It's just biology!"". I know he didn't mean to be mean, he's just kind of set in his ways, but it still felt like what I'm feeling isn't valid because I've got female genitalia and breasts... And then it got me thinking ""but he is right! I do have a female body... what if this feeling is invalid? What if gender is in fact just biology and these feeling are just part of my personality and that I'm prone to anxiety??""

Anyway, my therapist said that it was probably because I've lived my whole life in a society that only sees everything as binary and therefore I'm used to subconsiously thinking that way too. And that means that I have to come out to myself too, and learn to accept myself and get to know the part of me that I've been neglecting, and that it's a process and it takes time. She said that whatever I'm feeling, I should not have to feel like I'm a fraud or that I'm making things up, or that I'm not queer enough etc. 

I know this should make me feel great, but it doesn't. I did at first, but then it shifted. I took her words to heart, and today I decided that I wouldn't let myself put myself down by thinking ""you are weird and it's not real""-thoughts. At first it felt great. I went for a walk in the city, and I felt proud of myself for finally letting me be me and I even stopped slouching! However, that feeling didn't last, because as the day went on I felt less female than I've ever done before. I think it's because I've constantly pushed myself into thinking that it's just a phase and that I'm really female. Anyway, this is the farthest from female I've been and I feel like shit. The last couple of weeks I've started to feel uneasy when being called a girl and such, but I thought I was just imagining it. Anyway, today the feelings that I've been trying to hold back kind of pushed through and hit me with full force. I've started feeling more physical dysphoria again. Not very much, but more than before. Definitely wanting a more andro/male body build. And I also experience more social dysphoria. It makes me feel sad and hopeless that I know that no one will ever look at me and see something other than a female. And that everyone will assume that I am female. Always. 
I've been toying with the idea of picking a new name and introducing a it as a nickname. I didn't do anything about it though, because I thought I was just being silly and bored with my birth name. But now I feel really sad. Like I really don't want my name anymore. I want a neutral one, and since I'm swedish there aren't many neutral ones to choose from. Not that I like anyway. (srsly, apart from the two I've been thinking about, there's only kim, robin and elliot. And I really don't feel like they would fit me, and the rest of the swedish GN names all sound kind of made up. At least I think so...) As I said, I only like two. The first one is charlie, but that isn't really an option, because my cousins name is charlie. If it wasn't already taken I'd choose that one straight away, since I've liked that name since I was a small child. But since it's a no go my other option is Eli, which feels like an okay name. But not, like charlie, which feels just right... And also I'm afraid that people will think my name is Elin (which is a girls' name here) because it's pronouced exactly the same, except for the N at the end. And that makes me feel hopeless too, because since I'm unable to choose a name that I like, I have to keep getting called by my birthname and it makes me so sad and upset.

Anyway, into the nitty gritty. I was assigned a male at birth, and I find the female form more sexually appealing than a man's. But, and of course there has to be a but otherwise why would I be here,  I can't say that I feel that in a man, not wholy, nor do I feel like I am straight. In highschool I explored being transgender. I had a lot if female fridge and would ""begrudgingly"" let them give me make overs. Very soon I became increasingly melencholic, it's part of my being, but when it gets bad and turns into depression that's a different story. I felt like it was easier to be Gothic because I could get away with more effeminate clothing and make up, and instead of my super conservative and religious mother and step father, or my super traditional father and critical step mother thinking there was something wrong with me mentally, they just thought it was emotional, which was easier to coup with.

But I still wasn't attracted to men. I was attracted at women, I was shy so if course I had plenty of friends but was never in a relationship because even then I didn't quite know what I wanted. I dated for the first time as a 17 year old senor because the girl was just very forward and dominant. These days I don't like dominant, but I do like forward. Needless to say it didn't last long, but I got more bold and more social. I finally had sex when I was almost 19, had to wait until I was at least over the are of 18 right? Both parents would be proud of that if they believed it. And honestly I loved it, the beauty of the act, the intimacy. I'm an artist and a romantic, what can I say. But I learned then that I truly love the freehand form. It inspires me as well, there were plenty of times I would paint while watching a naked lover sleep, but it is mostly sexual attraction I realized. Because soon I started to club, which is where I got away from standard make sterotypes and saw ask the other faces of humanity. Especially feminine men. To which I took an instant liking.

I've never been with a man, the closest I've ever gotten was making out with our shirts off, most of my friends thought it was a stunt, but I thought he was beautiful, not handsome, beautiful, that's when I found that it wasn't the female form I was attracted to, it was the softness, glowing, the more ""effeminate"" nature that I was so attracted to. I found that I could have crushes and love men that fit in that niche I had created, and there are plenty in it. But transsexual women and Cross dressers are very attractive to me, but do are women, but not all women. I feel almost petty, but it is all about how they present themselves, how they take care of themselves. Things like weight and make up didn't matter so much to me as simply taking care of their appearance, and being genuine in their actions. Something I can say I don't do. But maybe this is of topic, I'm here for me, which sounds selfish, but I need to say this and hopefully find some insite and solice.

Now I get very strong urges to be a woman, though other times I feel almost genderless, and yet other times I want to be a man, a manly man. The gender less feeling may come from a confused sexuality as well as identity, but I wouldn't know. Maybe if anyone comments they will. I'm married now, to a woman, she knows how I fell and is fine with it which is great to know, but being as confused as I am, she is equally so. I do love her, we even have a perfect daughter who is 1 year old today actually. And all of that makes me happy. But that is a single aspect of my life, my identity as a whole has always been cracked, muddled, confused. When I have sexual urges, sometimes I imagine men, well mostly transgender women, there have been maybe a handful of men that I've ever known or even seen that I was attracted to as just men, but I also fantasies about women more so. So I feel bisexual, but again I've never been sexual with a man. And when it comes to my gender, I just don't know, I love my penis, I mean I totally love it, it's perfect and great. But sometimes I imagine having breasts and identifying as a woman would feel so great. Which in itself sounds like im transsexual. But other times I think, I'm meant to be a man, maybe those other thoughts are a testosterone deficiency or something. But I'm 27, well past the time in my life that my hormones would cause that big of a deal, and I'm conscious of my sexuality daily which I know is not standard.

I just don't know what to do anymore, and I need help and insite from the lgbt community that hopefully can relate to what I'm going through or have been through. I'm just at my wits end and need some peace, please. If you have any questions, I'm an open book, ask away if it will help.

I have a feeling this is going to be kind of long. So.

I honestly don't know whether I'm genderqueer anymore, or more, if I ever was.
I first started considering myself non-cis about this time last year, if not a few months more. I'd taken on the identity of demi-girl, which I later thought was acting as a stepping stone more or less as I was further exploring my identity.

And then… it seemed to get more progressive. At that time I was still basically a girl, expect kind of not. I still used she/her, still had long hair, didn't feel uncomfortable using the girls bathroom, etc. But then those kinds of things started to show up as I moved towards a more trans masculine identity. I broke down when my girlfriend called me a girl. I cut off my hair after being looked at as feminine. I started to experience dysphoria: anxiety about my chest, phantom limb feelings in my crotch area, and every period would make me suicidal.

Lately I've been entertaining the idea if going on low-dose testosterone. At first I was uncomfortable with some of the changes, but then they didn't seem as bad. But now…? I don't know. I have no idea if this is a phase or what. I mean, what if I was just doing this to fit in on tumblr or something like that? And the whole chest dysphoria thing is mostly just because of the way people see it as feminine. And there have been women who just don't like their periods, to the point where they feel disgust of the word 'woman'. And I've been known to have phases my whole life? Is this just another one?

Well, all started very recently, like 3 months ago. A oerson from my Facebook made a post saying that from that moment on, they wanted to people use neutral pronouns, shaved their head, etc. This got my attention, and since I got addicted to RuPaul's Drag Race, I started to see things differently.
I play online games since I was 10, and I used to use nicknames with my name (a obviously feminine name...) and didn't care, but about 2 years ago the harassment I was suffering for being a ""girl"" started to bother me, and more, I simply hated when my friends (whose were playing w/ me) yell at the chat that I'm a girl, so I changed my nickname to a neutral nickname and asked them to not call me by my name while playing, nor saying in the chat anything 'bout my gender.
But the inconfort only grow more and more, and I used to hate too when people refer to me as ""woman"" and stuff like this (out of the game, in real life too), and there is some time that I used to think ""wow, I want to be a boy so bad!"" like, if in the moment I was born I get the oportunity to being asked if I want to be a ""boy"" or a ""girl"" I surely would say ""boy"". And piecing all this together, I realized that I am genderqueer. 
But, by the other hand, my bedroom is pink, everything that I buy that has the option in pink, I buy in it, I love cute things, etc. So, somedays I want to be a girl, but then I learned that I can also be a boy who is feminine. 
But then I realized that I can also be agender, because there are days who I doesn't want to be any gender in specific, but there are days that I want to be a boy, etc...
Oh my god, I am so confused! I swear I've read a lot already, but the more I read about, more questions pop in my head... And some of them are: gender fluid and genderqueer are different things?

However, how I would cope with the inevitable reactions, mostly from the friends I was with, terrified me.

So, I'm back from Download and I have a nice long post to make. It was fun (and a bit wet), and I was half-dead by the end of it.

But anyway, an opportunity arose on day one, when there was just me and one very close friend at camp - the blame for me being 'out' at all lies squarely at her feet, and she's been great. With everything, her viewpoint has been 'do what you want and don't care about what people think' - she's probably bored of telling me that now, and if only I could embrace that, life would be so much easier. Anyway, she repeated that mantra to me when I told her what I was thinking of doing, and so eventually with everyone else away, I went and put the dress on. This was mid-afternoon, and I'd been drinking since about 08:30, so Dutch courage definitely helped too.

So, I sat down again, immediately feeling very self-conscious. But I then very quickly settled down again and we carried on chatting and had a bit of a giggle. I was however, still very much aware of the fact that I was wearing a dress, but didn't care. But anyway, slowly the others returned to camp (and generally looked at me quizzically), and I still had enough of a tipsy wit about me to give a half decent response to each - a truth, but just a part concealing the real truth. Although I'm ready now to answer a direct question, if asked, I'm not openly volunteering it, yet. I'm sure, much like I was before, that those peeps may have guessed that there is something to it, but none have said anything; for what it's worth, acceptance is not what I'm worried about - I have great friends - it's more a case of the more I step out and the more people 'know' rather than suspect, the harder it may get for me to control it, and having controlled it resolutely for a long, long time, I think it is that thought that scares me the most.

However, of the group that I was with, there is one person that I have been waiting for the right opportunity to come out to, and finally the chance arose a couple of nights back. He himself is straight-leaning bi, and an all-round good egg to boot. So we had a bit of a chat and his reaction was about as expected - ""you're still you."" As a bonus, in amongst the fogginess of mind that you get by having conversation being conducted while absolutely munted at a festival at 02:00, there were a couple of salient points that have stuck with me.

So I've just had an awesome week. There was the festival itself, which is just so much fun, but I also had personal success too - at so many points I caught myself smiling about the fact that I was further outside of binary box I've lived my life in than ever before. Even when I was just dressed in more standardised clothing, I was still wearing eyeliner and my nails were painted, and this just wasn't even something I was conscious of to the point it almost felt normal. Now if only that part would carry on to the real world.

The bigger picture though, is will this change anything going forward? After the first time I confronted my gender it took me a few weeks to settle back down, into the place where I've been for the last year. I have been comfortable enough there, but I'm just hoping I don't get a longing for more, or at least not before I'm ready to address it. But that is a story for another time...I'm good for now. :)

As a bonus, in amongst the fogginess of mind that you get by having conversation being conducted while absolutely munted at a festival at 02:00, there were a couple of salient points that have stuck with me.\n\nSo I\'ve just had an awesome week. There was the festival itself, which is just so much fun, but I also had personal success too - at so many points I caught myself smiling about the fact that I was further outside of binary box I\'ve lived my life in than ever before. Even when I was just dressed in more standardised clothing, I was still wearing eyeliner and my nails were painted, and this just wasn\'t even something I was conscious of to the point it almost felt normal. Now if only that part would carry on to the real world.\n\nThe bigger picture though, is will this change anything going forward? After the first time I confronted my gender it took me a few weeks to settle back down, into the place where I\'ve been for the last year. I have been comfortable enough there, but I\'m just hoping I don\'t get a longing for more, or at least not before I\'m ready to address it. But that is a story for another time...I\'m good for now. :)\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Festivals Are Great', 'created': 1434422343.0}"

130,2015-06-19 21:38:39,3ag5a9,12,15,"So I think I just feel like venting this. 

Im trying to come to terms with what it means for me to be non binary. Early on I had worried (and I still do) that I might not be a girl and that my trans identity is false. Well...

Im definitely trans. But I dont know what I am.

My gender identity is murky at best. I am AMAB and have lived most of my life believing that I was male because ignorance of trans identity coupled with a male body and societys expectations. I just thought I might be gay and had a weird kink for crossdressing and wanting to be a girl sexually.

Eventually I embraced the possibility that I was trans. And actually transition was the obvious choice. I wanted more than anything to be a girl, to look like a girl, to dress like a girl, to express myself as one, to have sex as one. The whole ""Do you want to do mundane things like grocery shop and taxes as a woman?"" Yes, duh absolutely.

But I struggled with feeling like one. Instead I spent a lot of time worrying that I was wrong, and that I was just a guy who wanted to be a girl.

Now I dont know what I feel.

My identity is hazy. I know Im not a guy. But I also know I may not be fully a girl either. I dont like masculinity. My expressiom leans all the way femme and sometimes dips back to slightly masculine. 

Physically I want a womans body. 8 months of hormones have gotten me closer to something Im truly happy with. I *love* the changes.

Still sometimes I feel that if there were no other option I might be ok with being a feminine guy. But I know I would still wish I was a girl.

I feel like I am non binary. And I want to be ok with that. Im Aly, I go by she/her. But am I woman?

140,2015-06-21 02:07:12,3akgnu,3,3,"Long story short, I have a friend I'm very close to, and we both have a romantic and sexual interest in one another, though our current situation doesn't really allow for a relationship (we live too far away from one another and both agreed long-distance was a bad idea right now). If it helps to know, I'm an AFAB agender person and my friend is a cis man.


Right now he still sees me as ""a girl"" *[shudders]* because I have yet to explain my situation to him. I just... don't know the right way to bring it up. That, and I'm also afraid of how he would react to it all.


The main things I'm worried about are these:


- I don't even know what his opinion/position on transgender and non-binary people is, or if he even knows what non-binary means in this context. I don't know how open-minded he'd be, or if he'd truly accept me.

- I'm afraid to bring up the fact that I'm considering hormones, voice training, etc. to bring myself more on the masculine side, because I fear he won't be attracted to me anymore, or wouldn't want anything to do with me anymore because of it. (As you can probably tell, he's very, very straight, though I do look somewhat masculine/androgynous already and he seems to like that. Though I'm agender, the things/ways I'm most comfortable in are ones typically associated with males and masculinity.)

- In his native language, my chosen name is male-only. I'm well aware that he will *never* call me by my name unless I really forced him to, and I don't want it to feel forced.

- I'm afraid he'll feel like I was lying to him and get angry because of it. It's only in the past few months that I really figured out my gender and stopped feeling ashamed of how I felt about myself, when we met I hadn't even started questioning anything about my gender identity, though I started soon after.


The irony in all this is that he's one of the people I feel most comfortable around overall, but I'm still too scared to bring this up...


I was recently talking to another close friend about these worries, and we both agreed that I need to tell him everything sooner or later. It'd feel dishonest to hide everything from him, and he needs to be aware of it so he can decide if, well... if I'm still worth his time or not. I'm scared, I really am. If I lost him, it'd break my heart. There's a part of me that feels like it'd be easier to just stay ""a girl"" and spend the rest of my life pretending to be one for his sake, but I've already spent twenty years faking it and I don't feel like I can live another twenty years like that. I fear that I will have to choose between being loved and being myself...


Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill again, but I'm just really scared of it all. What do you all recommend? Is there a way I can ""ease"" into it and gradually try to open up?

They were AFAB but identify as genderqueer and most everyone in the store loves them and is supportive.

We use headsets at work and sometimes people will ask if ""anyone sees her"" or something along those lines.

They are open about preferring they but I don't think I have ever heard them correct anybody. 
Maybe I am overthinking it and I know that everyone is different but they are pretty shy and I don't know that they would ever correct someone and I could make it worse by correcting someone.

153,2015-06-24 05:33:13,3ax610,5,5,"Sorry, I had to make a throwaway for this, because my main uses a username that I use on other sites, so I might get outed.

Anyway, I'm just so sick lately of being labelled according to my so called gender by society. I was assigned male at birth, but since I was born I felt like I had to meld to these ideal male standards, both in terms of physical appearance and expected behavior. It feels incredibly obvious that people treat me as a ""guy"" - not even limited to things like calling me ""sir"" or ""gentleman"", but also how people just treat me in general, like having a man perform a body search on me when I'm at the airport, female friends not making as much intimate physical contact with me (like holding hands) as they do towards other girls, and getting creeped out if I make physical contact with them, etc. I'm sure to people who don't really understand the complexities of gender, like /r/genderqueer does, people would think that I was a creep and making unwarranted sexual advances, but in these situations I honestly just want closeness in my friendships. Having to keep my distance from certain people physically also makes me feel like I have to keep my distance from them emotionally. And I think it's because people misinterpret and overgeneralize.

That all aside, it constantly feels like people are imposing a gender identity on me. I understand that this is the *norm*; people simply treat others based on their physical appearance with innocuous intentions. Most of the time, they'd be right, because most people identify with the sex they are born - so probably at least 9 times out of 10, if you went to a grown man and called him 'sir', he wouldn't mind. But I think I'm different. I have no idea on where my gender identity actually lies, but I can tell you without uncertainty that being constantly treated 'male' rubs me the wrong way more than a little mildly. It's not that I necessarily identify as female either right now, but maybe what I really want is for people to stop labelling me by gender so damn freaking often. I have certain ways to get myself out of situations where I'm labelled 'male'. For example, if I go to a department store, and a clerk calls me sir, I'll reply, ""You don't have to call me sir"". And then they'll just look at me a little weirdly, but generally oblige. But there seems to be absolutely nothing I can do *preemptively* to ensure that others don't label me by gender. Like, unless I pass as female or andro in terms of physical appearance (I don't because of things like facial hair), people will just call me 'sir' if they run into me. It's an automatic, almost Pavlovian conditioned response I get from people, although I have no idea what sort of reward they even get out of labelling others. Maybe it sounds more polite to say ""Excuse me sir"" than ""Excuse me""? No freaking idea.

Even if I do decide to accept maleness as part of my identity eventually, why make such a big deal about it to begin with? I'm East Asian, and people hardly bring that up when they talk to me. Like, the way someone would greet me formally is ""Hello, sir"", not ""Hello, Asian"" or even, ""Hello, person with dark brown eyes"". It almost seems arbitrary that we label others **primarily** by gender - pronouns, job professions, familial titles (aunt, uncle, etc). Maybe it's because humans are a sexual species, and without differentiating by gender, things like sexual orientation would be difficult to navigate. But why does it have to pervade so many aspects of human life? There's a thread called ""Why's everything so gendered?!"" which addresses a similar topic as I do here, but I wanted to tackle the entire, cumbersome concept of gender distinction. I want to challenge the dichotomy, just like many of you do in your daily lives. 

Going back to the body search example, I suppose it makes sense that having someone who presents as the same gender as you do search you is almost infinitely better than having someone who presents as the opposite gender - because in the vast majority of cases, people's presentations are consistent with their gender identity. You might have the occasional closeted trans man who feels uncomfortable when searched by a cis woman, but these are so few and far between that it's simply easier for everyone to assume that everyone who walks through those metal gates is cis. Of course there are a lot of institutional barriers when it comes to gender neutrality, some of which is based probably on misinterpretation of others' intentions, but a lot of it which is definitely based on real, societal issues - like men groping women on the subway. To be honest, I don't even fully understand what I want out of life. To ask for true gender blindness sounds a bit impractical and even unsafe, but when I get my credit card statement, do you REALLY have to affix a ""MR"" in the front of my name?

But what I dislike FAR more than the gender of my body, is the  social construct and hypocrisy around ""femaleness"". And today I got a full blast of it in the face. I work in a field where being prudish and squeamish gets you nowhere: Agriculture. You work in dirt and/or shit all day long, it's freaking hot and hard work so you get smelly and sweaty. Having a wet bra (and it gets wets FAST because having anything on top of it prevents it from drying out) means you're likely to get fungal infection under your breast or on your back, which is NOT fun.

Couple all of this with the fact that I am VERY sensitive to heat stroke for some reason, when it gets too hot I have NO problem ditching the shirt. I wear thick sports bra that squeeze the boobs down and shows absolutely NOTHING(because I hate to feel them move when I work), and if women can get practically naked and wear see-through clothings all the time without problem, I don't see why it would matter for me to work in a bra that hides absolutely everything but leaves my flabby hairy belly out. 

Apparently it bother someone though. Let's call him F. F lent me a small piece of land to do gardening in and gain experience for my future job(Veggie Farmer). In exchange, I help by tending to the cow in one of his stable for a few hours everyday. One especially hot day, I was tending to my field when I noticed he was nearby. I waved him hi, to be polite, before returning to my work. I'd had a heatstroke a mere few days before, so of course, belly was out.

I was a bit confused and hurt, but I understand some people have different vision of things and if it had stayed at that, I would gladly have just ignored him from now on should this happen again.

172,2015-06-27 13:18:05,3bauxb,8,18,"Okay, so, to set the scene: I live in a house with 4 other people, two of which are a gay couple and they of course have a butt-ton of LGBTQ friends. When the SCOTUS decision in favor of same-sex marriage came down, of course we had to party. A bunch of people were invited, many of whom were strangers to me but some of whom are mutual friends (but I still wasn't out to them, at least not blatantly).

Because of reasons that aren't really relevant, I wasn't around for the first half hour or so of festivities. So I don't know how this happened or what exactly was said. But apparently I got outed as ""gender neutral,"" which isn't quite right but, y'know, whatever, close enough. The night went no differently from the way I'd been expecting it to, for the most part. But I didn't even know I'd been outed until the conversation led in a direction where I played dumb about a comment someone made and, one roommate, realizing I was playing dumb, said, ""oh, yeah, we told them about the gender thing,"" and then something I forget along the lines of ""we thought it might make you more comfortable."" I haven't yet insisted on they/them pronouns but I've asked for no blatantly gendered terms like girl/lady/ma'am/etc. so I think what my roommate meant by this was that they told them with the intention of helping me avoid those things.

It's clear it wasn't a big deal to any of the people present, because, again, I might not have even known had it not been for that (and another incident where someone asked of my partner and I, ""oh, so you're boyfriend/girlfriend? oh wait, shit"" and was apologetic, haha.)

On the one hand, I feel like my roommates genuinely meant well and I don't think any harm came from outing me to this particular group of people. On the other hand, I don't know that I'm comfortable about being outed to people I barely know, especially because I *just* finally accepted I was non-binary about a month ago and am really, really early in the transitioning process (i.e. I got a short haircut and some sports bras and am getting a binder soon but I haven't even bought any more gender-neutral clothing yet and I'm not even quite sure if I'm doing HRT or any of that other stuff). And I don't even know for sure who knows and if that includes our mutual friends or not, because I wasn't exactly given a list.

Part of me feels like I would like full control over the coming out process, even if that means I have to deal with misgendering from people I'm not out to. That part of me is slightly peeved that this happened, because that control was taken away from me. But part of me feels like they did me a favor, because I'm still shy and skittish about this stuff and speaking up and the thought of coming out to people still makes the negativity committee in the back of my head go into overdrive. So I think it was useful to see that, hey, a bunch of people knew and it wasn't a big deal to anyone and no hateful bigotry happened and the world didn't end.

I'm just not sure how to process it, I guess. I don't know if I tell them not to do it again, because I don't know if the little bit that it bothered me is worth getting misgendered by friends of roommates (and they have people over *a lot* so it would be pretty frequent). I think I trust them to use good judgment in who they tell or not, since they're also LGBT and so have navigated the whole closet mess/""let's find out who's secretly a bigot!"" game. But I guess my main concern is that eventually they might tell someone who's not so okay with it, and then I have to deal with it, whereas if I'm the only one outing myself to people then I know exactly when and where I'm taking on that risk and the only thing I don't control in the coming out situation is the other person's reaction.

Sigh, IDK. My head's a bit of a mess right now. Thoughts?

EDIT: Thanks, all. I've given it some thought, and while I don't think I have a problem with them telling friends who come over, I'm going to ask that I'm notified who gets told and we're going to have to have a talk about what to do if anyone ever has a bigoted reaction (and if they're not willing to boot persistently bigoted people out of the house, they don't get to tell people anymore). I'm also going to ask that they limit it to friends who are coming over *only*, and not anyone else.

I had to really debate how I wanted to deal with it because I'm also bi, but I've known that for much longer and am much more ""settled"" in that identity so to speak so for that I seriously don't care who knows as long as they don't out me to my own family.

I met this girl a couple weeks ago, and we really hit it off.  I had mentioned my nail polish while texting between dates.  She was surprised, but and on our second date she had painted her nails to match.  Later on the date I mentioned that I shave my legs.  Again, she was surprised, but was OK with it.

Today she asked specifically if I cross-dress.  I told her that I did, and that I had wanted to talk to her about it sooner rather than later.  She wasn't sure what to make of it, but had a lot of questions, like: Are you bi-sexual, do you see yourself as a woman trapped in a man's body, would you want a sex change.

I think my answers were satisfactory (all no), and that my explanation that, to me, genderqueer is more that I like things that are more commonly associated with the female gender, but I still identify as male.  I pointed out that many things have been OK for women for a long time which are not OK for men.  Like wearing skirts vs. pants.

For me it's that I don't feel constrained by society's expectations regarding what I'm allowed to like.  I like wearing skirts (she doesn't), I like having smooth legs (so does she), I like my hair short (she has her's long).

So, recently, I've been feeling kinda weird. Not bad weird, but just weird. A few months ago, I wrestled with the idea of being agender, but decided to just drop it and let it roll around the old cranium for a bit. But here we are today, and I'm beginning to think I may be genderfluid/queer. I was hoping you all could help.

I don't exactly feel female. As I sit here typing this, I ask myself how I feel gender wise: the answer is usually ""just me"". That's fine and all, but I'm the type that finds a sense of security in labels. I'm frequently masculine presenting, but I don't feel, nor do I want to be male - I just don't dress or act like society's version of a woman. But at the same time, I also don't feel like a woman. I feel like I may just be mistaking my shifts between masculine and slightly less masculine as genders though. 


That was really vague and I should add more info, but it's late and I can feel myself getting less articulate. Reply now if you feel like it, and I'll reappear once I've woken up. Sorry :p

Edit: One thing I forgot to mention that seems to stick my mind - I prefer male pronouns. Maybe not prefer, but it's like I feel a stronger pull when someone uses he/him over she/her.

Growing up I was a tomboy who disliked girly things, nothing seemed unusual or dysphoric there. However I started growing breasts around age 9 and I remember figuring that out and crying all night and praying to anything that would listen to not let this happen to me. 

As I grew older and went further in sports I really started noticing how the girls and the boys were separated more and more as we got older. This separation was not just in the obvious ""separating girls and boys teams at age 13"", but in social stuff too. Suddenly I realised I could not interact with men the same way they interacted with each other, there was always a separation. And I found myself wanting to be male so I could have that friendship. And I wanted to be seen as a boy and related to as such by others. 

I started dressing in masculine/androgynous ways. I cut my hair short and messy. I was proud whenever I was mistaken for a boy. I was upset when people called attention to my ""real"" gender. 

I grew up and figured I put that behind me. I went forward with the notion of ""all being female means to me is that I have a vagina, other than that I am free to do what I please."" And it's been freeing. I now enjoy expressing femininity as well as masculinity, as our society defines these things anyway.

However, it never really went away. I'd still get so angry if someone drew attention to the fact I was a girl or woman, though I tried to brush it off as me being sensitive to feminist issues. But no, the dysphoria(?) would come in waves. 

Just tonight I was looking at a man wearing a button up shirt, and I felt such an overwhelming longing to look that natural in a shirt like that, to be accepted and viewed as he was, as a pretty average and sociable man. 

However, I still enjoy being a woman as well, and expressing myself as such.

My SO is incredibly straight. He's wonderful, but bringing up this subject has always been real sensitive to him. I think he doesn't understand that I still want to be a woman, and I don't want hormones or surgery.

But I also wonder if this really is that much of a big deal. I'd feel crappy if I outted myself this way only to realise that I really don't care enough to present as anything other than what I am, something I honestly feel sometimes. Also, I'm super curvy, big boobs and hips, so it'd be a lot of work to get myself to present masculine.

I have known for a while something's not quite ""right"" with me. I've had some ""I wish I was born a male"" -moments in the past as well but I just recently gave this a better thought. That was also the first time I experienced dysphoria.

When I feel bad because of my biological gender I want to cut my breasts off, hide under the blanket and never come out. I look in the mirror and see something I don't identify as.
But when the feeling subsides I feel stupid for even thinking about it. Sometimes I even think I'm making things up just because these are things people are talking about all over the internet. Which is stupid, of course, since my feelings are very real and painful.

I don't know what to make of this. I have my ""male moments"" but I certainly like my body when I feel more like a woman, since I'm very feminine. That's also the problem, since no matter how I dress or how much makeup I put on I can't trick my brain to actually believe that what I see in a mirror is a man. I know it shouldn't be the point but hearing all the ""it's what you think inside of your head that matters the most"" makes me feel like crap. 

So, I don't really know what I am. At least I'm not really trans since at times I love my body. I don't think I'm ""just a crossdresser"" since the dysphoria I experience is very powerful.

198,2015-06-30 20:46:10,3boc39,6,4,"I realized this is kind of long, but I needed to get this off my chest and also hopefully get some answers to my questions, and I felt like this is the only place where I can ask these kind of things.

So I wrote a post a few hours asking if there is anyone that also identify themselves as pangender. (I will delete it after posting this, because this post feels more relevant.) But now I kind of realize why there might not be any, because I was told that it is problematic, and cultural appropriation, which I hadn't thought of before, but now I can see why people would say that it is. 

I *really* don't want to offend anyone or be politically incorrect, and seeing as pangender is apparently problematic, I was wondering what my gender identity would be called instead?

(I just want to say beforehand, that I am sorry if I got it wrong when I tried to describe my view of any of the gender identities below. I've tried learning what everything is, since I've struggled with my identity for a while now. But I might have misunderstood some things, because no matter how many youtube videos I watch and blogs I read, people always describe the same things a bit differently.)

I thought for a while that I was genderfluid, but then I got the impression that it's mainly used by people who are fluid between male and female. And then I thought Genderflux, but that also seemed to be largely connected to the binary genders, mostly drifting between neutral and a binary gender. And then I thought of bigender, but I just don't feel like two genders. And I don't just feel like three either, so trigender isn't really who I am either. And then I thought of multigender, but the thing is I'm not *always* several genders at a time either. It shifts a lot. Sometimes I'm just one gender, but other times I'm five at the same time. And sometimes I feel like gender identities don't axist and then I thought, mayb I'm agender. But the next day I'd feel something else entirely...

I'm kind of upset, because I feel like I find security in having a label for myself. I know that others may not care, but I do. I want to know what I am, for my own sake. And trying to fit in to one of the identities I described above, made me feel like there was something off, and I constantly doubted myself, because one day I'd think ""I'm agender, I'm sure of it!"" And the next day I'd think ""Wait, that was wrong, I'm bigender!"" and so on and so forth. And the constant self doubt made me feel really bad about my self, because it made me think ""Am I just a fake?"" Because not even non binary people seem to believe that this is a thing, at least not from what I heard. One of my favourite youtubers have a video about gender identities, and in that video they say that you don't really have to bother to remember trigender, because they's never heard of someone being trigender, and it's just one of those ""be sure to include everyone""-identities, that no one has.. And that made me feel like shit, because I really look up to that person, and if they say that no one sees trigender as a real thing, then what would people think of the way I feel about my gender? And I'm also kind of afraid to post this, because I'm scared that people will react the same way and say things like ""that's not a thing"" or tell i'm trying to be a special snowflake or something.

I think that should be far enough down for the trigger warning, yeah?

Ok, so I don't know if there's some *disclaimer* about *trying things*, etc, etc, not a psychologist, I'm just a guy who's trying to figure stuff out.  So whatever that disclaimer is, imagine that here :P

Spoiler: Pay attention to your legs

Setting (that's right, this takes some setup.  At least until I got better at it):
Dark room if possible.  Otherwise, as close to silence as possible.

Ok, that's the setup.  Well, that was easy.  Hopefully.

Grab a chair.  Sit comfortably in said chair.  No fancy collapsing into it all draped all over everything, just park your ass.  Hands resting comfortably on your lap or armrests or wherever, feet shoulder-width apart in front of you.  Don't pull out a ruler or whatever, just close-enough it.

Close your eyes, and take a deep breath.  And I'm talking a *proper* deep breath... breathe in through the nose, try to breathe deep from the diaphragm.  A full relaxing breath in, and gently let it out over a few seconds.  At this same time, just *DROP* your shoulders.

Whatever troubles were on your mind, whatever worries were rolling over and over again through your head, abandon ALL of that, and focus on this ONE action.  Sense where your shoulders are... probably all hunched up from worry and stress... and just drop them.  It might help to toss your hands out to the side to flop listlessly at your sides.

Hey, didn't that feel better?  Try to remember to do that more often, you'll feel more relaxed :)

So, whatcha thinkin' of?

Feminine stuff?  Masculine stuff?  You remembering that local sporting event you're going to attend?  You picturing yourself wearing that cute dress you just got recently?

What are your legs doing?  Pay attention to your legs now.  What would be a more comfortable way to sit?  Your body is in a constant state of trying to come up with a more ""comfy"" position to be in.  What would be more comfortable for your legs?  Do you want to splay them out, like you're sitting on the couch, watching UFC and destroying a bag of chips?  Or do you want to cross your legs, and watch the latest romcom that's actually funny.  Like Bridesmaids!  Oohh, and maybe do my nails :)

What do your legs wanna do?  Again, no psychologist, disclaimer, blah, blah, but I figure that if you wanna splay 'em open and take up more space, you're more guy.  If you wanna cross 'em and take up less space, you're more girl.

Wanna push it one way or the other?  Oh look another imaginary disclaimer about... something something, don't hurt yourself somehow :P

Take that deep breath, drop your shoulders, and manually splay your legs apart or cross them together.  Change the setting.  Have some Behemoth ready to play, or some Britney Spears.  Change your clothes.  I'm in an apartment, so I've got some freedom to try these things, sorry if a lot of this isn't a possibility for others :/

I haven't worn a bra in at least two years. I stopped wearing one because it was uncomfortable and because my boobs pretty much stay up on their own.

I came to the personal revelation earlier this year that I am genderfluid, after experiencing dysphoria and a feeling I just couldn't place my finger on for a lifetime. Now... I'm graduating high school in 9 days and I'm planning on coming out to my parents then. My only problem is I don't know how to do it, how to adequately explain what this means and who I am, all the while fearing that they'll pass it off as a phase. So I guess I have a couple questions:
1. What are some creative ways I could come out?
2. What are some educational resources I could show them to help them realize that this isn't a phase and teach them what it means to be nonbinary?
3. Any other tips for coming out?

20,2015-06-09 14:16:12,395xko,5,5,"I always knew that I was not a typical girl. Incredibly tomboyish growing up, my family would tell me that I'd grow out of it, like the couple of aunts I have that were tomboys as children and incredibly feminine as adults. Except I'm almost 25 and still... me. 

I would say that growing up, I rejected the female stereotype completely. I never wore skirts or dresses, always wore baggy clothes, cut my hair shorter and shorter until I was just shaving my head. I didn't want to play with the other girls because they liked to play house. I found legos, video games, and power rangers waaay more interesting. The older I got, the more frustrated I'd get at my family imposing feminine things left and right. Make-up kits. Clothes I wouldn't wear in a million years. Attempting to fix my posture, walking, facial expressions, etc. They were trying to fit me in a box clearly not meant for me. 

As I've gotten older, there's been a shift in my perspective. I realized that I had a LOT of negative emotions associated with femininity that wasn't really deserved. I think somewhere along the way I realized I was being pretty anti-feminist by putting down my best friend for wanting to be more feminine. She, like a good friend, got all up in my face about it and motivated me to find a new perspective. I now understand that femininity is just as valid as masculinity.  And I let myself kinda flow in between my comfortable tomboyishness and a little more femininity.

The thing is, I act way more feminine than I perceive myself. I assume that I'm usually pretty gruff and straight to the point. I've taken to surveying people and most perceive me as fairly feminine these days. I don't know if it's purely personality but my hunch says it has a lot to do with my super curvy body, my grown out long curly hair and high voice. I used to hate those qualities about me but lately I just own them. I am what I have and what I think.

I've started to date a wonderfully honest trans woman and she has definitely rekindled the mystery of my own gender identity. She's typically more classically feminine which works great for her, but there's moments where I feel like she's treating me as a cis-gendered woman and I find myself in that weird place that feels not quite right. I have no body dysphoria whatsoever. I experience a great deal of social dysphoria, however. 

I've been in drag a couple of times, but it was just drag. it wasn't meant to be this moment of ""oh my god, I make an incredibly handsome man."" But it sure was. One night when no one was home I made myself a beard with make-up, put on a suit and tie and I was floored by how Amazing I looked. I've always looked more like my father than my mother and that was just... I was his grown-man-son in that moment. (a year later my dad subtly came out by mentioning his female name and months after that sent me a picture of him all dolled up. He still uses male pronouns and is closeted to everyone but me. Even weirder, we're both bisexual. I don't understand genetics. Anyways.)

Today I would say that I'm moderately feminine and moderately masculine and moderately something else altogether. So how do I present that to society? Physically i can look however i want, but when it comes to social dysphoria and explanations and labels and all that exhausting stuff I've admittedly been avoiding, what can I do? I've liked the two-spirit idea. Not exactly me, but it's the closest thing to what I feel. I don't switch from one to the other. I'm at a steady constant of both &amp; more.

30,2015-06-16 21:42:34,3a37yu,5,2,"Hey there! After simmering with the thought for about two years, I've discovered/ decided that I am gender fluid. 
Unfortunately, I still feel like I'm up river without a paddle at night. So please, if you have advice or maybe links to helpful websites that explain different paths, terms, and/or success story type things, that would be magnificent. Just help of any kind to help sift through my thoughts.

Feel free to stop reading now, I just want to share my story and vent. Hi, I'm 18 years old, and biologically female. I'm comfortable with that and I have no intrinsically motivated body dysphoria. I'm lucky to have small boobs that disappear in a sports bra. I'm very comfortable being biologically female and wouldn't have it any other way because I am literally a baby making machine and that is an amazingly special ability that I could never throw away. 
I enjoy being perceived as a delicate, beautiful female. But I also want to be seen as a handsome male by at least someone, it doesn't even have to be many people. But because I'm naturally feminine, no stranger is ever going to automatically assume I'm male without effort put in on my end to change my appearance. So, although I prefer long hair and a freshly made up face on myself, I've cut it short and stopped wearing makeup as often. I didn't recognize the true motivation behind my actions until after I did it. A few days ago, I realized I cut my hair because I reallyyyy like it when people mistake me for a guy. 

So it's not that I mind being a girl. I'm still very happy as one most days and I don't want to discourage people from seeing me as a beautiful woman. But I just want to open up the door for whoever wants, to see me as a handsome man as well. Then sometimes I feel strictly neither. I just don't know. 

I know this is truly how I feel and I should own it but I still feel conflicted, scared, weird, ashamed, etc. about my discovery because I'm easily influenced by the opinion of others and I feel like I'm just trying to complicate things. I haven't even told my family that I'm pansexual yet. I'm pretty sure my family wouldn't be angry at me if I told them everything, they would just think I'm confused and make fun of me in a way that's supposed to be loving but is really just hurtful.
I feel like no one is going to like me any more because they'll be attracted to one side of me but repelled by the other. Or, at least, I feel that people willing to accept my gender fluidity, and still want me in a romantic and sexual way, are going to be few and far between.

I should also throw in how amazingly blessed I am because my best friends are being nothing but supportive and loving. It was kind of just ""Yeah, you've been hinting at this. So what pronouns do you want to be called?"" I am so aware that so many people's problem is that they don't have a good support group and I am outrageously lucky to have best friends that will take news like that in stride and go with it like it's no big deal.

My parents aren't strictly christian, or something like that, and they are alright with me having had a boyfriend at some point.

However, I know my father won't react to this well. I once showed my parents, some years ago, some pictures of me in make-up and a dress, which was a small experiement how I would looke like with make-up.

My father didn't take well to this at all and began talking to my mom, as if I wasn't in the room, that he was concerned. Not that his son may be unhappy, but that his son might be ""like THAT"".

Recently, a film came on in which the main character was a transgender woman, and the actor did a good job portraying this. When my brother came downstair, he asked if it was a woman. My dad said no, and at the same time, I sternly said; yes she is. My father then turned to me and, annoyed, said that I shouldn't just say so, as ""opinions may differ"".

So, yeah, that. Then again, he could also, when he understands better, still accept me; I don't know. And I can't tell my mom, because my parents are a team, and telling my mom would be equivalent to telling my dad, essentially.

The only thing I know for sure is that I'm not a transguy and I'm pretty sure I'm at least partially a girl. The problem is I have no idea if I'm actually NB or if it's just in my head. I've been told that I have borderline tendencies (I haven't been diagnosed with BPD though) so that's kind of made me question everything I do and feel--do I really feel this way or is it just me wanting to be a special snowflake?

Aside from the body stuff, there have been times where I've felt out of place with girls and more comfortable with guys.

I'm sorry if this isn't making any sense.

Recently I made the decision to become gender-fluid, switching between my male and female to whatever feels right. On top of that, I'm also a very burly build, so feeling feminine as my female counterpart on the outside can be troubling for me. I don't think it's dysphoria, though it might be a mild case of it.

This led me to the conclusion to turn to HRT Pills for Male to Female. I gladly sacrifice my manliness as my male self to bolster my femininity as my female self.

My wife has been very very supportive in my decision, but after me and her decided on whether I should use HRT Pills, (Which was a thumbs up) She brought up another issue that she broke down about.

I believe she is confused and upset about these two different sides of me. I've given my female side a name separate from my birth-named male side. So to personal reasons I have to stay like this. What's bugging my wife is the fact I talk about the opposite like a different individual, even though both sides of me are the same with the same memories and experiences. My male and female sides do not fight with one another.

The first way we've fought against these confusion for her is for me to stop saying things like ""Would you like to watch a movie with ""girl name"" tomorrow?"" or ""I don't know, though ""male name"" might want to."" and instead something along the lines of ""Well, if you want I can cuddle with you as ""girl name"" tomorrow."" Which has helped a lot with her coping with it. 

Another issue she brought up is feeling like one side of me doesn't like her. Like for instance my male side had no interest in watching a movie with her one day. Then the next time she asked I was my female self and was more than happy to. She felt like my male side didn't want to do things with her. I told her that although they're two separate side of me, I'm all still present. It's not like my male side isn't aware of what my female side had done, and vice versa. Actually, it's almost like the inactive gender is still there, listening, watching, and experiencing what the active gender is doing.

Though I still feel like something is bugging her. She seems okay with the HRT pills and even having intercourse with this new female side of me.

And finally, I felt very strong feelings of both feminine and neutral gender vibes in myself, and embraced the fuck out of them!

For my whole life up until this point, I'm assigned male at birth and have been comfortable living in a male body with a male identity. However, recently, I've begun to explore a side of myself that always felt a little more feminine. I've never been into the stereotypical macho culture, and I've always gotten along better with women than with other guys, even though I have plenty of male friends.

Last week, I did a thought experiment before I went to bed one night. I laid in bed and imagined myself as a girl from head to toe. 100% female, voice included. I've always been attracted to women, so I pictured myself being held and kissed by another woman in this form. Something inside of me felt happy at that moment, and I slept fine that night.

When I woke up the next morning, I still felt good. I went to take a shower and saw my reflection in the mirror. I saw my all-natural male body, but in my eyes, I felt my female persona looking back at me. But I felt great about that blend of seeing my male face and body with a female voice inside my head. Like I was finally whole.

At this point, I've no interest in changing my body, taking hormones, or wearing women's clothing. I enjoy my body as it is (apart from some weight I need to lose), and I still prefer male pronouns.

I also desire to present in a feminine way (cross-dressing, long hair, make-up, etc). 

I dislike my masculine body and presentation. I feel gross and unattractive looking this way.  

However, I do *not* desire to have breasts or a sex change. I consider myself a man.

So clearly I have some dysphoria about my body and presentation. What makes me think that I might be gender fluid is the fact that the dsyphoria seems to wax and wane. In other words, some days it's there but just kind of simmering in the background. Other times the dsyphoria is so strong I have panic attacks, cry hard, or suffer severe depression all day long.   

Would a change in the intensity of the dysphoria, rather than an actual change in genders, be enough to qualify for gender fluid?

Or is the change in intensity of the dysphoria coming from me switching back and forth between different personas? The masculine persona obviously wouldn't feel much dysphoria, but the feminine persona obviously would be very stressed out.
