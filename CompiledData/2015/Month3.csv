6,2015-03-07 18:02:54,2y9bc4,10,6,"Hi r/trans!

I recently started a job as a barista at a cafe/bakery in Los Angeles County, and will address customers as ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" if I am ringing them up or if I need to catch their attention regarding their order. 

Sometimes I will encounter trans customers and there are moments I am unsure if I'm using the correct pronouns. 

With transwomen, I feel like it is easier to use the correct female pronoun since they tend to present themselves very feminine. 

With transmen and masculine-looking women, I find it a bit more confusing because I am afraid to use a female pronoun on a transman, or a male pronoun for someone who identifies as female. I myself am a woman who leans toward androgynous presentation, so being called ""he"" would make me feel pretty giddy on the inside, but of course that isn't the case for everyone.

Dropping pronouns for all customers seems like the easiest way to combat the problem, but it also doesn't feel very polite. 

Any thoughts? Am I getting worried over nothing? I want the customer to have a pleasant experience at our store, and I don't want accidental misgendering to end up dampening someone's mood.

I thought I knew what being trans meant but it's become very clear very quickly that I have no idea where to start. Telling me was a big step for him and I don't think he's ready to really discuss it yet. I've done some research and reading about it but it hasn't really given any insight as to the mindset or what he personally is going through, and I want to know more to support him as best I can. 


I know this is separate from his sexual orientation - he still likes girls etc. but he just desires to be one? So effectively with a lesbian girl? He mentioned something about always not being sure of himself or feeling complete because he has been suppressing and as much as I am trying to empathise it's just not happening; I just don't get it. He was quite vague so if anyone could explain better what he is thinking or going through that would be immensely helpful. I saw a couple yahoo posts where people were making statements such as ""your boyfriend never actually existed"" and whatnot and I'm not sure if that's what's happening here; because because regardless of any change wouldn't he still retain his personality??? 

Am I essentially dating a female? He's been going to the gym and been trying to get ripped and all that, he has a load of what are traditionally considered to be 'male' traits so it's very hard when I try to reconcile what I already know about him with the fact that he sees himself as female.  He isn't that fussed about the physical side, but more of the identity crisis thing if that makes sense.

51,2015-03-31 15:23:43,30xnbd,8,2,"This post is gonna be kinda longish, and has a bit of a story, so please try to follow along! 

This past summer(2014), I was living with some people who turned out to only have offered to let me move in because they have a fetish for transgender women. A few months into living there, my sister got in touch with me, and offered to let me move in with her. At the time, she was unaware that I'm Transgender. At this point, I was almost a month living full time, preparing to see a therapist/psychiatrist about starting HRT so I can start to transition in more than just how I dress. I came out to my sister, and she told me she was fine with it, but that I couldn't transition while I was living with her and her family. 

Out of desperation to get away from the people I was living with, I accepted her stipulations and made the move. For about a month, it didn't really both me. Possibly because I was more excited to get to see my niece and nephews every day, and spend time with them. As far as I'm aware, her husband and the kids aren't aware that I'm trans. 

I've gotten to a point where I can't stand presenting as a male, and being restricted in what I can and cannot wear(dresses, skirts, flats, etc.). She pesters me to cut my hair, but I just outright tell her no. I Cut it when I moved in to appease her, but I've begun growing it back out, and refuse to cut it again.

Here's where I need help; 
I want to move out of here, and somewhere that's more transgender, and overall LGBT, accepting.

A few months into living there, my sister got in touch with me, and offered to let me move in with her. At the time, she was unaware that I'm Transgender. At this point, I was almost a month living full time, preparing to see a therapist/psychiatrist about starting HRT so I can start to transition in more than just how I dress. I came out to my sister, and she told me she was fine with it, but that I couldn't transition while I was living with her and her family. \n\nOut of desperation to get away from the people I was living with, I accepted her stipulations and made the move. For about a month, it didn't really both me. Possibly because I was more excited to get to see my niece and nephews every day, and spend time with them. As far as I'm aware, her husband and the kids aren't aware that I'm trans. \n\nI've gotten to a point where I can't stand presenting as a male, and being restricted in what I can and cannot wear(dresses, skirts, flats, etc.). She pesters me to cut my hair, but I just outright tell her no. I Cut it when I moved in to appease her, but I've begun growing it back out, and refuse to cut it again.\n\nHere's where I need help; \nI want to move out of here, and somewhere that's more transgender, and overall LGBT, accepting.

53,2015-03-31 17:30:46,30y53h,0,1,"...and I feel mostly good about it. I know everyone's situation is different.  Sorry for the wall of text:

For now I'm going with gender neutral. I'm 28 and I have definitely always felt disgust at my breasts, but not so much below the waist. I'm a married lesbian and have been very masculine presenting for the vast majority of my life. My wife is incredibly supportive and isn't really surprised by this.

I kind of am. Honestly I feel less legitimate because it's not like I hate/hated being a woman. Feminism has helped me really love myself and my body and I was content with that until this recent questioning within the last year or so.  I would say that starting to seriously lift weights, I realized I'm never going to achieve the physique I truly want - big pecs, no breasts, broad shoulders, a gnarly beard. Growing up I always saw myself as a boy, and even now I still have to sort of like, remind myself that my body looks more like the women than the men on the cover of Men's Fitness right now. And that bothers me. I have done drag with a full on beard and I LOVED being a man for the few hours I've done so. I know it's not the same, I'm just talking about the feeling I got in fooling myself that I was a man and how good it felt.

I guess I feel somewhat selfish because I know it's a lot to place on my wife and family. I don't really feel that anxiety or disgust with my genitals the way some people do. On the one hand I kind of feel like I could continue to live as a woman, but on the other I really feel a deep longing for being able to shave my face and grow a beard. I know I need to stop comparing my own situation with others to ""legitimize"" my feelings as a gender questioning, possibly transman. Also we are trying for a baby and I just am facepalming the shit out of myself for this incredibly weird timing. I mean, I never really had a strong suspicion that I might be trans until recently. I feel like a fraud for it being less of a build-up the way it can be for others. Also a teammate started transitioning and seeing how happy he is, I just saw him and thought ""holy shit that's what I want."" 

When I think about the implications of all this, it dizzies me. I have literally no clue what the future holds for me and my body. Will I transition? Will I take testosterone? The idea of having top surgery excites me like you wouldn't believe. But I have a real fear of the unknown. There are so many resources available to me, and it's so much that I almost don't even want to begin.

I feel lost. I just don't know where to even start. The good thing is that my wife and my mom both know I'm questioning. My wife is taking it amazingly well. But I'm nervous that a possible transition would wreak havoc on our marriage. She's a lot less nervous than I am. I just don't want to risk any inkling of not being with her.

When I told my mom at first she took it kind of not so well, but then within the same conversation was/is very supportive. I think she doesn't really understand. She weirdly is more okay with my becoming a man than with my current state of neither. I think she just wants to be able to place me in a box she understands and I'm not in any box at all. But I know she'll love me no matter what, she's been 100% supportive of my being a lesbian and when I admitted I was questioning she said it makes sense and that she's always felt at heart I was a boy. But I think that's her naive way of misunderstanding masculinity among butch women as trans and it's hard to make her understand the difference. 

Lastly, I do feel sad at the idea of leaving womanhood behind. It's not like I ever was super feminine at all, but...it scares me to think how some of my best girl friends will think of me as not one of them anymore. I play for a women's rugby team and I'm sad to either give that up or eventually having to play with men...ouch!

Only I can tell you what my gender is, right? But what if I'm lying? What if I'm lying to myself? What if I just desperately want to feel like I'm part of something special and awesome (the genderqueer etc. community)? What if just hate my real gender so much that I now have a delusion that I'm not a man? This is what I've been feeling like recently. Gender, just like sexual orientation, is not a choice, right? Gender is who you are, and what you feel internally fits you. You don't choose it. But I feel like I might be trying to choose my gender. If I was honest about what gender I feel like, regardless of what I want to be, I would say that I feel no gender. I don't grasp the concept of feeling a gender. I certainly accept people who do feel a gender. But when I try to search in my mind/soul/whatever for a gender I see nothing. I don't really 'get' gender. Does this mean that I'm agender? I would love for that to be the case. But that's exactly my point. I want to be agender. I want to be anything but a man. When I think of myself as a man, I hate myself. I won't accept the male gender for myself. But what if I am just a man who hates that part of myself? What if my true gender is a man but I just wish it wasn't? Can I then choose to be not a man? Can I refuse to be a man?
I'm sorry for the ranting sort of. I'm just really confused and sad that I might be a man who just wants to be special. I hate it. I certainly hate the physical maleness of my body, but that's a different issue than gender. I wish I could choose, but I can't, right? How can I actually know? Do I have to be a man? Also the fact that being a cis man is the easiest and luckiest thing to be in our world makes me feel bad for rejecting that. Lots of people would love the privilege that I have, but I'm just trying to throw it away. 
Anyway I was just wondering if any of you lovely people could maybe provide some insight into this issue and maybe help me. Thank you so much.

I've never felt an association/identified with 'girl/woman/lady'.  When someone would call me that, I'd be surprised, and have to remind myself that that's what I was. I've never been feminine or girly in the slightest; I always preferred masculine hobbies/toys/clothes/etc. as a kid. I never wore dresses or skirts, or anything floral/pink. Also, my parents were always very gender neutral with my brother and I. If I wanted Lego (which I did), I'd get it. My brother and I would play together, and I'd never feel like I had to play with certain toys or wear certain clothes. I'm thankful to my parents for that. 

I don't wear makeup, very rarely do my nails, and have very short hair. I always wear [masculine attire](http://i.imgur.com/EVDreU0.jpg), and have been mistaken for a boy/man several times in my life. I've also been told I have an androgynous face. 

I think maybe one of the reasons I don't associate with being female/a woman, is because I've never been feminine. I've always been very tomboyish. All the things that 'women' are 'supposed to be', I'm not. 

Also, I'm asexual and don't want kids, so I really don't associate with my female body either. I don't mind it, but I don't feel connected to my genitals, either for sex or procreation, which might also contribute.

7,2015-03-02 18:17:30,2xoxeh,11,11,"Hello :)

I apologize in advance, this is more of a word-vomit for my benefit. I just need to get all my feelings out in words...

I found myself reading through r/genderqueer after a not-so-great conversation with my longterm girlfriend. I don't know how to explain to her that while I'm FAAB, I don't feel like I fit in as a woman. Or man. I ended up crying like a baby last night when she tried to understand me by asking questions about my feelings on my gender. The topic has come up on and off throughout our 4 year relationship, but I usually just end up brushing it under the carpet because I don't know how to explain it to her (a cis-woman). She's really worried about me, because it's obviously not getting any better.

Honestly, I feel lost. I like dressing as a man, I don't like my body's curves (luckily they're minimal), and I wish my voice were lower. BUT I wasn't one of those kids that knew from an early age that my body was wrong. I don't think I'm trans, but I wish there were a way to take a male body for a test drive. 

At the same time, I don't mind female pronouns, or my obviously feminine name. I avoid public bathrooms at all costs, because I'm afraid to use the men's room and I usually get the stink eye in the women's.

I guess in the end I'm just wondering if anyone else is/has felt this conflicted about themselves. And how do I explain my gender uncertainty to my girlfriend?

I ended up crying like a baby last night when she tried to understand me by asking questions about my feelings on my gender. The topic has come up on and off throughout our 4 year relationship, but I usually just end up brushing it under the carpet because I don't know how to explain it to her (a cis-woman). She's really worried about me, because it's obviously not getting any better.\n\nHonestly, I feel lost. I like dressing as a man, I don't like my body's curves (luckily they're minimal), and I wish my voice were lower. BUT I wasn't one of those kids that knew from an early age that my body was wrong. I don't think I'm trans, but I wish there were a way to take a male body for a test drive. \n\nAt the same time, I don't mind female pronouns, or my obviously feminine name. I avoid public bathrooms at all costs, because I'm afraid to use the men's room and I usually get the stink eye in the women's.\n\nI guess in the end I'm just wondering if anyone else is/has felt this conflicted about themselves. And how do I explain my gender uncertainty to my girlfriend? \n\nThanks to anyone who read this far! hah"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'new to reddit, new to genderqueer', 'created': 1425345450.0}"

I recently (like 6 months ago) realised that I am agender. this may sound bad but I feel like I'm some weirdo and freak. I'm worried others will think the same and this I'm just attention seeking too.  How can I accept that this is me? It's still an odd feeling knowing I'm not a boy or girl. How can I live as agender and be happy with myself?

**2) Who else here is out and why did you decide to come out? Should I come out?**

I'm struggling to decide if I should come out. I'm amab agender and I dress masculinely and people view me as a cis guy which i'm perfectly fine about. I even don't mind he/him pronouns, I just wish people could know I'm not a boy. I worry if I come out that people will judge me :?

**3) How will I ever get a boyfriend or girlfriend if I'm out as agender?**

I'm off to university and I'm imagine (proably wrongly) that it'll be this utopia where I (or anyone for that matter) can live openly as anyone they want. However I'm worried that people will think I'm abnormal and not date me because I'm agender and take the approach of ""eww i'm not dating them, they're not even a boy or girl"" even though I look masculine as if I were any other cis guy

**4) Lightening up my parents**

I told my parents *ten whole months* ago that I'm genderqueer and they - particularity my mother - haven't quite accepted that I'm not uncannily anomalous and want a sex change. She even kept asking essentially if I'm still GQ, that is until I gave in and told her I'm not just to get her to shut up. How can I get her to stop freaking out if I tell her again that I'm agender? It's taken her more time to accept that I'm genderqueer than it took me to realise that I'm agender.

I'll just jump right into this as to not waste your time

I'm a male and still in highschool and thus, still under my parent's care.

Now, they know about me being gay and whatnot (Mom is okaaay with it, dad is on the fence about it), my mom also knows that I'm striving for a more feminine body, but not wanting to transition or anything. My body shape is another story, but as the title suggests, I need some tips on what hair style to go for.

I have been growing out my hair so when I go to a stylist, they have more hair to mess with, but I still don't know what I should get. Personally, I would LOVE something like [this](http://imgur.com/a/FyEWJ) (Shortish hair and longer bangs, you get the idea) And yes I know they're models and mine might not be as perfect, but it's just to give you an idea. (Oh and my hair is  dark brown, I've thought about maybe coloring it/bleaching it)

But my parents (my dad especially) aren't the most accepting people in the world. My mother MIGHT be okay with it, but I doubt my dad would.

My questions are: 

1.) What hair should I go for as to avoid too much confrontation with my parents and others will still getting that girly hair I want?

2.)How can I find a stylist willing to do it? (I don't want to embarrass myself!) 

3.)Should I show them a picture of the hair I want? (I don't think I have the guts to show them a girl model) 

4.)A BIT off topic but, should I do my eyebrows? It'll look much better with the hair I want but I feel like people would pick on me at school (I don't really care what they have to say, but you have to admit, it is pretty annoying)

5.) Not really a question but ANY tips about this general topic would REALLY be appreciated!

So yeah... it needs to be kind of unisex but thrown more to the feminine side. I can also post pictures of my current hair/face if you would like. (The reason I didn't post this to a hair subreddit is because I feel like you people would understand more)

Sorry for the wall of text but that's the shortest I could keep it!

Also, if there's a better subreddit for this post PLEASE tell me!

How much function do you retain downstairs? I know that female hormones and AAs can really mess with your libido and cause some shrinkage. Have had that happen on AAs when I was on a higher dose. 

But I mean are you still capable, after feminizing to have good penetrative sex with your partner if you're feeling particularly masc?

There are days when I really love to dom someone (And penetrating someone is part of that experience for me, not sure how else to explain it) and even though I desire to be more femme in body I also don't want to lose a lot of masculine sexual function (this opinion might change for me once/if I start hormones). But I'd just like to see if I can get some info on what it might be like if I did. 

Any insight is appreciated. Feel free to PM me if you don't want to comment.

60,2015-03-10 00:03:53,2yi37x,4,31,"I went to my HRT follow-up appointment today with my doctor. 

*A little context:* She had given me T on an informed-consent basis 2 months ago (50mg/wk IM injection), even knowing that I'm nonbinary, despite the fact that she had never prescribed HRT before. She had gone to a trans medical conference to learn about trans medicine, specifically because I brought it up. She even asked for my preferred pronouns and preferred name at that time, but I told her to just go with what I have down because I don't care and that would be easier. 

So today, I went to the follow-up, and I was really nervous because I want to decrease my T dose so I can stay on it longer (I don't want to completely transition to male, so I'm going to have to stop at some point).

I've never been much of anything. I knew the gender assigned to me at birth, and I went along with it for most of my life.

I fucked up.  I fucked up hard.  I should have had top surgery instead of that first boob job.

Note: If I offend anyone with anything I say about gender, orientation, roles, etc, please chalk it up to ignorance.  I'm still working on figuring this stuff out.  

About me:  I'm a transmasculine individual, AFAB, still trying to figure out where I fall in terms of gender and how far I want to take myself in terms of transitioning.  Could be FtM.  Could be genderqueer.  Could be demiboy.  There's some fluidity there, but I pretty much always stay on the androgynous to masculine side.  Even in boy mode, I'm well aware that I'm pretty femme in presentation.  Think Visual Kei.  The point is, I've done something terrible to myself and feel completely trapped.

You see, as a female, I'm considered extremely attractive.  I'm a rather famous professional glamour model.  I did actively pursue this career for the financial benefits.  No one forced me into it.  I saw an opportunity and took it.  Who wouldn't, assured an income well into six figures a year?

I thought that would be enough.  A fat wallet, and (as I once remarked to a friend of mine, laughing bitterly all the while) all the men I could eat.  

Note, I'm pretty damned gay.  Let's just assume I'm solidly masculine for a minute.  I'm really really really gay.  To the point where straight cis guys have been freaked out by me and said I ""make them feel gay,"" even when nothing as overt as a strapon or roleplay is involved.  The people who are most into me long term are bi, non-binary, or (in a few cases) gay males.  I like men.  I like a great variety of them, as many cute ones as I can get my hands on, and I don't like them in a hetero way.  That's abundantly clear to me, and I can tell from responses that, to a degree, my partners are picking up what I'm throwing down.

And no, this is not simply a reaction to my career.  I lived as a man for a few years before I heavily pursued this job.  I would say the modeling career is more strange to who I truly am.  

I want to transition so much.  I'm hitting middle age, and while my career is showing no signs of slowing down yet, I'm abjectly miserable.  My entire life's work is predicated on being female.  But I am not female.  It's a lie I've been telling for far too many years.

The worst part is, I've had a lot of plastic surgery to enhance my female looks.  This was a calculated business move.  It's paid off very well, but in the mirror, I am the most hideous of monsters.  I used to be able to pass as male.  Now, with these breast implants?  Not a fucking chance.  Not even with the best of binders.  This augmented ass?  Yeah, well done.  Good luck with that.  The most clever men's suit in the world couldn't save me.  My face?  Don't get me started.  I'm very pleased with the aesthetic result, and it is fantastic surgical work, but this body is 100% at odds with who I am inside.  It looks worse now, than at the beginning of my life!  Worse still, because I asked for it, paid for it, suffered the procedures for it.

I feel like I'm suffocating.  I'm having a hard time working any more.  My residual income is fine, and I'm far from broke, but I am completely trapped by the persona I've created for myself.  What the hell can I do now?  What the hell will I do if I transition?  I could afford it, but what about afterwards?  Counselors don't get it.  Lovers don't get it.  Friends don't get it.  ""Oh, you're so and so.  The famous whatsit.""  Yeah, whatever.

I want to have my implants removed, my ass lipoed back off, cut my hair, move to a foreign country, and start all over, but that doesn't seem very practical, does it?

If anyone knows of a surgeon who has done top surgery after implants, (A cup breasts before very large implants) then that would be EXTREMELY useful info.  Other than that, I am not really sure what I'm asking for, other than the vouch that I'm not totally nuts.

I'm depressed.  I feel stuck.  I can't take it any more.  Not for any princely sum.  Kindness would be majorly appreciated.  Any ideas what to do next, so I don't freak the fuck out would also be appreciated.  I've got financial resources and an ok living situation.  The only thing that would be potentially difficult is escaping my own celebrity.

Thanks for listening.

I wake up one day and stumble to the bathroom, still half asleep,  wearing just a t-shirt and shorts. I meet my mother in the hallway, and she gives me a weird look and laughs. I ask her what's up. ""Nothing,"" she replies, ""it's totally fine. I mean, after all, I know that you're homosexual. You know I have no problem with that."" ""I... umm.. okay?

I can relate to trans folks' stories. I'm biologically a male, dress as male (for the most part, with a few flairs on) and identify with both male and female personalities.

I've thought ""how would it be if I were a girl"" ever since I was 6. It was always there. I used to like ""girly"" cartoons, like Sailor Moon and Sakura Card Captors. I felt it was pretty normal, until I was told those were for girls, and I was a boy, so I shouldn't like that. I also used to be a crybaby and pretend I was a girl. My parents told me to ""man up"". 

At 10, I started paying attention to high heels. Enter 13-years old me. I realized I liked girls (and hated boys, ended up kissing my brother at 11, it was awful). There was this class where we hugged the classmates, and I always felt good hugging the girls, never the boys. I also started cross-dressing with my mom's clothes, until she found out at 18.

I remember the day pretty well. She came to me and asked ""were you wearing my dress??"". Later on, my dad came to me and said ""look, I can't arrange a girlfriend for you, you have to do it, we could go to a hooker"". After that, I didn't do it anymore, also because I think my mom's clothes are too ugly.

I took an interest in fashion, makeup and nails. I'm not embarassed to talk about this very much, but other people feel that way... I had a girlfriend, but all she had to say about it was ""you might have been a woman in your past life"" and ""you're the man here! Act like one!""

Now I'm an adult, and gave some more thought about it. I experimented with having female alter-egos, and that brought some more light into things. Right now, I don't feel the urge to be a woman like most transgenders do... it's more like another side of me that melded with my current self. I ended up taking the best of both worlds and walking on that fine line. Girls I talk to love me because I can speak their language and ""get"" their feelings.

If I could start everything from zero, I'd choose to be a woman. But I realized the path I am taking is much easier for men.

And no, I don't like guys at all. Being harassed by bullies sexually at 12 and 16 was horrible.

I’d chalk it up to cis-centric and binarist messages everywhere, but I just plain don’t feel like I have a gender. But I'm autistic so I feel like I should label myself ""weird autistic female who doesn't know how to gender, still female tho"".

And I know that being agender is a thing but like… I feel that by not being sure about my gender it just means that I haven’t searched hard enough? Either that or I’m trying too hard and I’m really just a woman even though trying to straight up say or type “I’m a woman” makes me uncomfortable. Like, that probably just stems from pretending that I’m nonbinary, riiiiiiight? Okay, yeah that was sarcasm, even I can tell that’s a stretch.


I’ve been lurking in r/ftm and looking at chest binders and packers and I’ve bought some men’s shirts that i like wearing.

I’m considering the sports-bra type one from underworks, but my parents are leery of me “ordering any more underwear online” since I had to explain away my last couple binders (I’ve given those away, they didn’t fit right).

The crux of the issue is that I live most of my life happily as a cis-male who is predominantly heterosexual.

But I will also have weeks where I feel distinctly femme.  I will get dysmorphic at my body - I have broad shoulders, a beard, an abundance of body hair, a penis, all of which I wish was gone.

I'm gay but I'm romantically attracted to males and females. Sometimes my mind says things to me that I don't agree with and I don't feel like these thoughts are mine. When I think about my gender I feel like there's a weight on my chest pushing hard. When I first accepted that I was gay, I felt really happy and that it fit me perfectly.

There are reasons that I could just be male, but there are also reasons that I could be something else. I've seen guys and wanted to look like them on wear what they're wearing, I don't want to get rid of my body and facial hair completely, I like puberty and when I first saw chest/armpit hair I was excited, before this I had a low self esteem and when I thought of my desired body it was always male. I I had the choice I would still chose to be born male. 

I remember looking at some guys not long before my questioning and thinking ""I want to look like that"" so it's confusing me. I've liked the look of some of my masculine features before, like hair and Adam's apple. I used to always imagine myself with another man as male, but now it switches. Sometimes though I feel feminine in my mind. While questioning, I wore one of my mums bras and stuffed it with socks, when I looked in the mirror I didn't like what I saw I looked at felt uncomfortable. Sometimes I look at girls and think that they're really pretty, but I'm the same with guys. Sometimes I get images in my head of cutting open my genitals and I really don't like thinking about that. 

I don't identify with strongly men or women. I think male and female clothing look good. I feel best when I feel like I can be male, but even then there's this nagging feeling inside me. Sometimes I look down at my penis and think that it's so small and pathetic. I feel like my body is ugly, but I wouldn't prefer a female one and I still wouldn't like it. When I look in the mirror and think that I look good, there's always a voice that says ""no you don't"". I'm not sure how I feel about pronouns, both have some unpleasantness to them. I don't feel like I fit in with boys, but neither with girls, I prefer to be in a mixed group.

I have depression, anxiety and self esteem issues so I could just be that. My depression has never been about the fact that I'm a man, it's mostly about my looks and personality. I don't think I am a girl because of how I felt in the past. It's never made sense, before this I had a low self esteem and when I thought of my desired body it was always male.

I'm AFAB and identify mostly as a woman (socially), but I don't fit the (stereotypical) gender role of women perfectly so I feel like I don't fit the label ""woman"" perfectly.  Basically, even though I pretty much identify as a woman, I *also* think that gender roles are inherently limiting and kind of stupid because of that - if that makes any sense...

Could that mean that I am genderqueer?  Or am I just a confused, weird ciswoman and I shouldn't appropriate the term?


_________________

[As a background to my gender:  When I was young (maybe 7-13), I dressed like a tomboy, wore my brother's hand-me-down clothes, and often wished I were a boy (but not to a point of being miserable with myself or my own body).  In high school, I started to dress feminine out of social pressure and didn't mind it, but I was not super feminine.  Now, post-college, I dress both masculine and feminine.  I feel physically comfortable and cool in masculine clothes that fit me well, and I feel sometimes sexy but sometimes awkward in feminine clothes that fit me well.  

Socially, I am a lot more (stereotypically) feminine - I squee at baby animals, I relate better to women, I enjoy romantic comedies, I am empathetic and emotional, etc.  I'm not entirely stereotypically feminine, though:  I like video games, I like adrenaline sports, I am not interested in fashion or makeup, I can be very strong willed, etc..  But I'm definitely not (stereotypically) masculine either - like *at all* - I'm not athletic, I'm not aggressive or confident, Im not that into cars or sports or science, I have a very low libido, I am more socially anxious around men, etc.  

Physically, I'm really drawn to (both attracted to and wish I could better portray) androgyny.  I wish I had  both a female-bodied and a male-bodied version of myself that I could switch between whenever I wanted, and I wish that I was gendered as a woman in my female body and as a man in my male body.  More realistically, I think I'd like to be perceived in public as a guy sometimes, a woman sometimes, and an androgynous person who can't be gendered sometimes.  I don't have gender dysphoria that makes me miserable, but sometimes I wish I had a flat chest instead of breasts, sometimes I wish I had a slightly more androgynous face, and sometimes I wish I had no genitals... (I hate having a vagina not because it's a female part but because not being able to see what's going on in there terrifies me)].

Like, ""No one else thinks like this, why in the world are you?""\n\nMaybe gender fluid isn\'t the right label for me. I don\'t know. But I feel like if I do decide on a different label and try to take back the one I told people before, they\'ll judge me a lot. And they\'ll stop trusting me with what I label myself and just cast me off as some attention whore. \n\nGod, I can\'t wait to go to college. I just want to start over new.

106,2015-03-17 23:52:42,2zet8m,1,1,"...two steps back is how the saying goes. Or you have today, where I feel more like I've been playing Dance Dance Revolution.

So, I spent a long, long time questioning my gender, and then I eventually came out as 'probably' genderfluid to a good friend last summer. That I did that still surprises me occasionally even now, but mostly, having someone I can lean on if I need to is something I do feel thankful for.

Anyway, part of my questioning was in the way that the whole feeling behind my gender would come and go, and my appalling attempt at having a normal adolescence. There's the whole gender and orientation not being a choice thing, but I couldn't and can't help but wonder if that doesn't mean they're fixed. I didn't do the usual teen thing of throwaway relationships, etc, so in that regard I still now have no idea what I'm doing. So I'm loathe to disregard that as a factor as much as anything else.

So when I was in the process of spilling my deepest secrets, I came to the conclusion that I was at a fork in the road. I had begun to start thinking that a relationship is something I might like - I'd never been too fussed before - the whole gender thing playing a non-exclusive part in that. This wouldn't really be for the sex (which gets into a story which will be for another time), but just the closeness with someone, which I've never truly had but have had something close enough that I'm pretty sure I know I want more of it. I couldn't help but contemplate that if I were to finally go down this road properly, the gender questioning would lessen (and there have been extended periods in the past when it just hasn't been an issue).

But I also reasoned that this whole gender thing wouldn't really just go away, given what I knew about the nature of gender &amp; orientation. So I talked about the idea of going down the gender exploration route. I've not gone to any real extreme, but I have taken small steps to blur the lines a tiny bit. I'm quite distinctively AMAB, but being part of the alternative scene has given me the opportunity to add a touch of makeup to an otherwise masculine appearance. I don't think I'll ever publicly go much further than that, but that I've reached a point that I feel able to do it is somewhat uplifting.

So the latter option was the easier, at it was reliant on just myself, rather than getting anyone else involved. The limit of my experience in the former goes as far as two occasions where it didn't even get off the ground, and as I need to be able to do more than just be friends with someone, therein lies a difficultly.

Anyway, long story short (ironic, given the length of this post), there is a girl from work who I've for a while been potentially interested in, but the idea of actually being interested in someone in this way is almost a completely alien concept. Anyway, she's mentioned that she doesn't have as much of a social life as she would like, and I used this as an opportunity to suggest we go out for a drink sometime. She liked this idea, so I can definitely move forward, but I obviously don't know yet if this will be just drinks with a colleague/friend, or if it can develop into something more. Either way, I will be out of my comfort zone in a way, but relaxed too, as we do seem to get along and chat really easily.

Anyway, to bring this all back around, I realised that this line of thought threw me around and off the track I thought I was on. While the whole genderfluid thing that I think I have identified does throw me onto some part of the female spectrum (although I don't at all come across as effeminate or camp), I'm also too strongly tied to the male part; however, I've never felt truly attached to maleness and masculinity. 

As I began to contemplate the idea of what could lead to what with situation I've described - something I'm predisposed to do with just about everything that happens in my life - I realised that exactly what I had been ponderous about back in the conversation with my friend in the summer was possibly going to happen (i.e. swing more strongly towards male than I would do otherwise). It wasn't just a case of being comfortable being male, but actually feeling and wanting to be more masculine - something that never, ever happens as I'm already more than masculine enough for even the days when I'm feeling my most male. And with everything that has happened in the last year, it kinda caught me by surprise (and hence the DDR comment at the top).

So it's another wall of text I've put here, and once again, I'm not really looking for any specific responses, if there are any to give. But like last time, it's been useful to be able to type it all up and get it off my chest.

134,2015-03-21 16:27:34,2ztexh,7,9,"So, I have been confused for a long time now. I guess many of you can relate.

If i have to label myself it likely becomes 'intersex masculine androgynous androphile'.

I am intersex, having a condition called 48xxyy, which is mostly chromosomal (hence invisible), save for some not quite typically male curves.
I am masculine, I have no desire to be female (no offence) and was assigned male at birth. I am more or less comfortable with male, or at least from a binary perspective it is the most comfortable option for me.
I am androgynous, as I do play with my appearance and mix what others consider typically masculine and feminine (though I look at things void of gender).
I am androphile, as I am attracted to men. If you assume me male you could call it gay too.

My face, if I shave properly, is perfectly in the middle of masculine and feminine. You just can't tell. Depending on my clothes my body leaves you confused too. These are just my chromosomes and genetics and have little to do with how I choose to present myself.

I've been trying to answer the question if my ambiguous gender identity stems from being intersex and having an appearance which could go either way. Or could it be from my rebellion against the world? Could it be because I am actually comfortable being male but not with what society expects a male to be? And also, could my attraction to men (which took me years to accept) have somehow caused me to not consider myself male in some twisted way and an attempt to find an acceptable state of being?

Of course none of you can answer these questions for me and that is not what I ask.

It isn’t that I feel illegitimate to refer to myself as GQ, but because I am AFAB and used female pronouns, it felt safer. It even felt like an okay fit, since my identity and expression leaned prominently in the feminine arena. But I love my female body. I’ve only experienced body dysphoria once, and I’m enjoying the process of exploring what and how I express my gender spectrum.

That being said, it feels like my *baseline* pronouns if you will have shifted. Thinking of myself as she/her suddenly made me really uncomfortable. And yet, being referred to as they/them just seems so new and scary. I’m testing the waters with neutral pronouns, but I’m still feeling shaken by the shift. 

I worry about the backlash of exploring different pronouns only to find it didn’t work out for me. But talking with my partner, I also learned to remind myself that, first and foremost, I refer to myself as “I” and “me”, and instead of searching to what to call myself, the better way to phrase it is “what part(s) of me do I want others to acknowledge when addressing me?”
 
Initially, I was feeling limited and unsure what to call myself. My gender identity is, as we say, Facebook official and public, so it felt unnerving to change the GQ pronouns from she/her to they/them. The only problem is that neither pronoun group seems to fit… kind of like when you have this word to describe something: you know it's there, it's in the back of your mind, on the tip of your tongue, but you can't place it. 

So yeah, that’s my Wednesday morning. I wasn’t looking for anything more than just calming the growing panic by writing about it on here while talking to my partner at work. But if you have a similar story to share or maybe some advice, I’d love to hear about it.

I also want (and have wanted for a couple months now) to make my hair blue. Light blue around the (shorter) sides and a darker navy on the top where it's longer. Mom bought the bleach and the lighter blue a while ago (she was okay with doing it for me, buying the supplies, etc.; I just haven't asked her to do it yet) and I bought a navy from the same line when I decided I wanted two-toned. I bought some blue eyeliner/eyeshadow and stuff today and I wanna play with that.

I'm not really comfortable with calling myself feminine. I like my binder (but need a non-full-tank one because of my previous discussion with Underworks about sizing and fitting the right size over my body) even though it sort of just monoboob squishes. I wear a hoodie over it. The one time I forgot to take it off immediately when I got home/wear my hoodie while still wearing it, mom was like ""what bra are you wearing? it's doing weird things"" (since it was monoboobing hard that moment) and I just told her it was a sports bra. I just find boobs inconvenient. If I could wake up tomorrow and not have them with no surgery or whatever, I'd do it. 

I also kind of want to try wearing a binder under some of my more traditionally feminine clothing. IDK. I don't go in for dresses or skirts often. Mostly I wear hoodie ('cause comfy, lazy, easy, and warm) and jeans or whatever. 

I can't pin down what gender I am. I've always been pretty ""tomboy"" growing up - but that's all gender roles and shit, so that doesn't really help, now does it? I feel like GQ is just an umbrella that doesn't help me. I don't know if nonbinary describes me because I don't know if that requires I have a gender or what. I don't know if I'm agender. I don't know. I don't even know my (unrelated, I know) sexual or romantic orientations - demi is my best description for both of those.

http://gender.wikia.com/wiki/Transfeminine

interested in being able to ""pass"" as female (or at least come close enough) but some of the transitioning to being a trans woman is bothersome to me.

i guess i should just describe what i want and what i dont want, and maybe you guys can give me some tips on how to accomplish these things.

i do NOT want:

+ sterility or genital shrinkage / malfunction

+ UNSURE about boobs.

i do want:

+ better skin tone, tighter, smoother, smaller pores, women's skin basically

+ changing facial features to be feminine(already doing laser hair removal on face and going to start on my legs)

+ more feminine figure, wider hips

+ NO BODY HAIR

+ currently growing my hair out long.

pretty much out as a vague and generic ""trans"" to everyone, made a new facebook profile with my femme name.

however, the ""dysphoria"" for me isnt really there.  for me its mostly just an absence of how i feel when im being /me/ and feminine.  everything just feels so congruent and my emotional being lines up with the rest of me like it never has before.

people have told me i was beautiful and i didn't believe them, i thought i looked ugly.  one of my friends said ""wow, you really are a woman then.""

i dont really know what i want.  i just want to be able to be myself.  i dont mind having to go into ""boy mode"" for certain things, although it is a drag if i have to do it too much.  the prospect of ""full time"" is exciting and terrifying at the same time.  im trying to not over think this and kill my own vibe, i dont have to be making all these decisions, and i can change my mind.

im just getting comfortable with myself after years of denial

so that is why there are certain irreversible things that i am not willing to do.  i also do not trust surgery.  what can i do?

here are some pictures of me:

I'm AFAB, 30 yrs old, with lots of leg and armpit hair, and large-ish boobs for my frame. I live in a hot climate and don't like to wear much clothing. I started wearing bras about 7 years ago, but I still don't like them.

I am trying not to judge myself in composing this, as it’s been stressful already trying to piece out. I hope you will not prejudge me either while reading it. 

I feel a deep discontentment with my female body 95% of the time.

I think some aspects are quite amazing (like menstrual cycles and the potential to give birth!), but that doesn't detract from my general unease and disgust with femaleness to the degree that I feel pinned down by it (or trapped in it!).

I was born female. I am heterosexual. I don't know where I fit on the gender spectrum, but I have always been weary of the binary norms. Despite this, I am frustrated with myself for being uncomfortable with being female—something strictly biological. I think that I shouldn’t feel one way or another about it. It’s not some role forced onto me. It just is what it is. But I do not like my body, and it causes me great unease. 

When I look in the mirror, I can't accept what I see. I hate my hips and butt and breasts. My thighs just seem generally shapeless. Overall, I have a weaker composition than most men. I hate how ""soft"" I look. My facial features are soft as well and I am drawn to sharper, deeper features (otherwise more masculine ones). To be brutally honest, I am repulsed by what I see. I don’t think that generally speaking women are ugly or anything like that. I just don’t get why it’s in the mirror. 

I have had an obsession with men from a young age. I have always picked up on their privilege. To me, they seemed more free, more successful, funnier, braver, more outrageous, more lighthearted, and less complicated than women. I looked at men and I saw power and movement, joy and grounding. I looked at women and saw sacrifice, pain, accommodation and anxiety. Men just seemed like the half that had it figured out.

Obviously looking at that now, I realize there are so many things that have traditionally held women down and still do. I hate the expectation of some effervescent personality, of that need to feel accommodating, of acting stupid when you're not. Of women congregating over things like consumption and trends, instead of more enduring things. (Again, this is what's reflected in the media, but it's also experienced. I simply did not fit in with girls my age, nor do I feel I fit in with college-aged women today. I find their interactions surprisingly vapid, maybe even scripted, and dissatisfying.)

Does this make any sense? Is my disgust with gender norms bleeding into how I literally perceive the female figure? 

Is there someone out there who can help me piece this together? I would greatly appreciate input.

I have lived the majority of my 20+ years as a cis female who always felt a really ""off"" about gender, and who, as a child, experimented with gender fluidity (as least as much as my conservative parents would allow). 

As I read more and more in an attempt to better understand myself, I am realizing that I actually probably identify somewhere in the genderqueer/genderfluid/neutrois zone: some days I am male, some days I am female, but mostly I'm just a person-shaped creature who couldn't identify with either gender to save my life.

I actually really like myself, way more than I did when I was younger. And on my female-leaning days, I feel really gorgeous and amazing about how I present myself in public. HOWEVER, between those rare periods, the dysphoria is BAD. I try to be positive, but on my neutral days I feel so unstylish (my gender-neutral uniform is a men's polo and women's ""mom-jeans"", light makeup and no hair styling, not exactly eyecatching attire), and on my male days, it hurts to get out of bed because I know I will have to spend the rest of my day managing/hiding/trying to ignore curves I wish I didn't have.

Also, I should note that I have zero sense of style (see ""mom-jeans"" above), but at the same time I really, really crave a style that would be suitable for me, that I could manipulate slightly to control and increase/decrease the masculinity/femininity when needed, but ultimately which just generally says ""I am not trying to ascribe to either gender.""

10,2015-03-16 15:39:07,2z8ow0,6,15,"So I changed gender this morning (From M to F) and it hit me a lot harder than I expected. I've always tried (or wanted to rather) to some extent suppress how I feel and  ultimately act, you know, as society and others expects me to.  
&amp;nbsp;


Some days? Yeah I feel like a guy and everything feels great. I feel confident and can walk around dressed as a guy like I normally am. Other days? I feel super feminine, envious of other womens curves and what they get to wear. Some days it goes so far that I can't stand my male genitals but again, it changes from time to time (obviously).  
&amp;nbsp;

Now I am not short or androgynous by any means. I'm tall, 6'7 to be exact, and have a strong build; the world dictates that I act like a guy and be masculine, moreso because of this. And really I HATE it. I wish I was shorter and slimmer, shorter moreso, so that I could realistically pass when I feel female and such but thats not the case. Part of me feels like Im trying to suppress it, hoping that it'll eventually go away (I know it wont, lets be realistic here) or I'll change because even passing as female is totally impossible. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm out to one friend of mine right now. I don't see her often but shes really involved and accepting in this kind of thing. It's still really wierd with somebody knowing, I'm still pulling the whole feigning indifference thing. You know, acting like it doesnt matter, being passive or whatever to avoid some sort of embarrassment. It's habit by this point because embarrassment terrifies me and I've always worked to avoid that.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways I don't really know what to do. I am relieved to finally understand whats going on with me, or start understanding it rather, but its created a whole new set of issues. How do I deal with my shifting gender at my height and build? I am fine when I am male, but when female it seems hopeless. I want to feel comfortable whether im a girl or a guy. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am really new to this so I just kind of ranted what is on my mind. If I offended I apologize I don't really know how to go about stating things yet.

I've always tried (or wanted to rather) to some extent suppress how I feel and  ultimately act, you know, as society and others expects me to.  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nSome days? Yeah I feel like a guy and everything feels great. I feel confident and can walk around dressed as a guy like I normally am. Other days? I feel super feminine, envious of other womens curves and what they get to wear. Some days it goes so far that I can't stand my male genitals but again, it changes from time to time (obviously).  \n&amp;nbsp;\n\nNow I am not short or androgynous by any means. I'm tall, 6'7 to be exact, and have a strong build; the world dictates that I act like a guy and be masculine, moreso because of this. And really I HATE it. I wish I was shorter and slimmer, shorter moreso, so that I could realistically pass when I feel female and such but thats not the case. Part of me feels like Im trying to suppress it, hoping that it'll eventually go away (I know it wont, lets be realistic here) or I'll change because even passing as female is totally impossible. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI'm out to one friend of mine right now. I don't see her often but shes really involved and accepting in this kind of thing. It's still really wierd with somebody knowing, I'm still pulling the whole feigning indifference thing. You know, acting like it doesnt matter, being passive or whatever to avoid some sort of embarrassment. It's habit by this point because embarrassment terrifies me and I've always worked to avoid that.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnyways I don't really know what to do. I am relieved to finally understand whats going on with me, or start understanding it rather, but its created a whole new set of issues. How do I deal with my shifting gender at my height and build? I am fine when I am male, but when female it seems hopeless. I want to feel comfortable whether im a girl or a guy. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nI am really new to this so I just kind of ranted what is on my mind. If I offended I apologize I don't really know how to go about stating things yet.

18,2015-03-22 07:04:04,2zvvg8,0,0,"Hello everyone! I am a 29 year old dominant bi sexual male. I do, however, have slight switch tendencies from time to time but dominant even in those situations as well. I am looking for a either submissive females or submissive males (including feminine boys.) I'm looking for something specific; a sequence of events that lead to an intriguing RP(however what I primarily seek lies along the realm of just a submissive partner in general.) Keep in mind, I am looking for before hand planning(""Porn Hunting"") for inspiration. Consists of the submissive listening to my desires and helping me to find pornographic images, similar to my wants/kinks, as well as theirs and also to inspire an RP moment. I have a passion for details both about myself and about others, so I love to know clothes details, bodily details, make up etc. Role Play may be anything and everything, so any other ideas you may have feel free to come to me with, along with pictures. However what I primarily seek and have a special place for is: Transformation Gender Play but other than that I am open minded to all types of sexual situations of course. If this is your cup of tea, read forward. 

I am seeking a scene that revolves around two male best friends; roommates. What happens is that one of us(or both of us) magically transforms from male to female. The twist is that the transformation is not triggered by some sort of magical potion, but it is triggered on our own guilty pleasure: Viewing porn pictures. It's a bit of a interactive twist that I want to try; incorporating porn pictures in the mix and actually looking at them together. Furthermore, the point of this ""porn hunting"" is that it will also help you see what I look for as well. The progression of how we ""bro out"" to porn is first by gawking at and literally picking the pictures apart and then slowly gradually noticing things in the porn that make us both realize in ""self discovery/epitome fashion"" together that ""hey, maybe being a chick is a sweet deal."" In other words, the appeal of power and money (free drinks, club life etc) is what ""tricks us""....That will be how we justify wanting to be a chick without sounding ""gay"" so to speak. It's a bit of a mix between orientation play, denial and simply a ""twisted bromance."" Also, one thing to take note is the manipulation flow. The ""vexed porn"" will poison your mind with this self-discovery first and then the way it will infect my mind is by you ""selling/manipulating"" the idea you just discovered and preach it to me as you porn hunt.

As I mentioned before, what I want us to have initially is a ""bromance/jock"" type of dynamic together. What that means is, I want more of a laid back conversation flow/style; I believe the slang term is ""chat speak."" I know it seems a bit rudimentary but oddly it is something that pleases me(I don't usually talk this way in real life.) I want there to be more of a laid back style of talking with one another; call each other ""bro, dude, man."" I want us to make jokes with each other, laugh, say lol. I want there to be also a hint of orientation banter/homoerotic jokes even borderline flirtation but in a denial sort of sense(if that makes ANY sense lol.) Don't be TOO much of an ass or be too mean. Remember we are best friends. Show some sense of warmth. Now, in terms of what I want you to pay attention for when we ""gawk at bitches"" so to speak is that I want you to verbally gawk at the women with me; pick apart the photo, describe the photo and what you enjoy in colorful ""eye candy"" detail. I don't mean just to say ""check those legs and heels on that babe"" but instead describe the heels, what color heels, what kind, and how her legs look, the skin tone etc. Also, keep in mind if I zone in on a specific part of the pic that is your cue to describe specifically that part with me. I want you to describe the pic as if it is not in front of us, pick apart and visualize the photo of what you enjoy(and even dislike) in true ""bro"" fashion. It's a way for you to not only learn my tastes but also to get into the style of inadvertently pleasing your ""bud"" with our ""circle jerk"" sort of porn session. Think of it also as an interactive approach to training you to learn my tastes and wants as potentially my switch/submissive.

In terms of ""kinks"" and ""fetishes"" I would have to say it's ever evolving and quite an open book. However as of right now, my interests are: orgasm control/edging/teasing/denial, roleplay writing(obviously lol) and most importantly just the mental aspect of being dominant and in control. What I mean by ""mental aspect"" of control I mean I'm not going to pound my chest and be like ""Me Joshua, you be my bitch"" because that is obviously not me and in poor taste on my part. I just wanted to make it known that's what I am intrigued in. However, for me, I don't particularly believe being dominant is all about the physical side of being dominant. To me it's far more deeper and on a more mental level than just say ""tying someone up."" Don't get me wrong I have nothing against doing that either but you get my drift. On a side note, in terms of ""vanilla"" kinks, I do have a huge weakness for legs(high heels, stockings, etc) and eyes. Consider my ""legs and eyes"" as my ""tits and ass"" that most typical men gawk at. And lastly, the more simplest kink would be my addiction to porn photos on the web(pictures.) I may be a romantic type but I am a guy after all; all men have this addiction regardless lol

I'm pretty new to reddit but I came here because the community is really appealing, and it seems that people really great advice on here.

I'm DMAB and I've struggled with dysphoria for a really long time, but always brushed it off as a phase or something and kind of pushed it under the rug. Long story short, I think I accept my gender identity, but I'd really like to *do* something about it. I have no idea where to start.

I feel as if I'm disadvantaged because of my build. 6'2"" 240 lbs, but very little muscle and still fit medium shirts. I can grow a thick stubble/modest beard relatively quickly which is really unfortunate and I grow hair on my chest and stomach too. :[ 

Can anyone give me a list of fundamental starting points to work on to ideally learn to pass or at least be comfortable with my female side? I'm 22 but I have the stereotype ultra-christian household so my hands are tied in some respects. Anything to help at least get me started would be amazing!!

Has anyone here gone on HRT? I'm mostly masculine identified (AFAB) but I have the occasional neutral or even more feminine day. For me, it's very much about physical dysphoria. I absolutely do have social dysphoria, but it keeps me from leaving home most days, so that just leaves me to exist with my body dysphoria.

Most of the time, I really want a ""male"" body. When I think of myself having a deep voice and muscles and a penis I feel happy. But on my neutral or female days, I'm alright with the body I currently have. I'm afraid that if I go ahead with HRT, I may later regret it and miss my old body. There are some things that would be permanently changed if I took T, and I feel a sentimental attachment to certain things (my voice, my boobs, etc.) despite them causing me severe dysphoria most of the time. Plus, if I were to take T I would want to eventually get top surgery, as a relatively thin person with F cup breasts, binding longterm would not be worth it for me to keep them in the end.
