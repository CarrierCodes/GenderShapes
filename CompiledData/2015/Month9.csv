When I was 13/14 (The general age for sexual confusion, puberty and hormones and all that. Blah) I used to dress myself up as a boy, it started out as a joking around sort of thing with my friend. But I loved doing it, we made a profile on that old website 'Tagged' where we would live out this other persona, and while I think it was little more than a bit of fun for my friend. For me it was something more.

Ever since then I just sort of ignored all the feelings I had back then. It was easy for me to brush it all off as 'Curiosity', because I was so young. Occasionally I would get the urge to crossdress again, but I never did.

But a few days ago I watched a music video for the song Sky Limits by Yohio. Yohio is a very feminine/androgynous male. I suddenly realised that I found that very attractive, that I liked thinking 'I can't tell if they're a boy or a girl'. Thats when I started to really dwell on my feelings of wanting to dress as a boy.

But I don't want to BE a boy. I know in my head and heart that I'm happy with my gender being female, but I also like to dress as a boy?

I'm so confused.

One moment I think I could be androgynous, the next I think that I may be gender fluid? And others I think that I'm just a girl who likes to dress as a boy sometimes.

I'm a little more stable on my sexuality, I'm pretty confident in saying I'm pansexual.

Last night someone tried to fuck my ankle up, this resulted in me having to go to A&amp;E.  Loads of blood, lots of pain.  

So as they are disinfecting it in the waiting room and putting a bandage on to stop blood flow, I mention that I'm trans and that I would prefer to be called by the right name.  No biggie, right?

Waiting room staff were lovely, looked after me very well.  I'm brought into the triage area, nurse was very lovely and very kind to me.  Added the notes to my file about pronouns etc...

So back out into the waiting room to wait to be seen by an actual doctor.

Roll on an hour...  I'm called by one of the nurses, she helps me limp into the room I was going to be seen in, not able to put any weight on my foot.  

This is where shit goes bad.  Excuse the language, but the doctor was a straight up *cunt* and I suspect something about it had to with the fact I'm trans.  

To start, she kept using the wrong pronouns.  Then, she started telling me a story about a trans person she had previously worked with, the tone was not nice.  She refered to her as a man, and admitted she didn't enjoy working with ""him"" (her.).  She was very openly hostile to me, I requested she call me by my name and to this I got a sigh and she just stopped using any name to refer to me or talk to me.  

I had to get 19 stitches and 12 paper stutres, and I was in absolute agony.  This is where things continue to get worse.  

The doctor accused me of self-inflicting the injuries.  She accused the cuts of being self-harm because of my history of ""mental instability"" (I was on anti-depresseants for 2 years when I was younger.) as well as the soft tissue damage.  Like yeah, right, I smashed a hammer into my foot and dragged nails across my foot.  Totally.  

So I ended up leaving with no pain meds, hell of a lot of stiches and just being told to keep weight off it.

I'm a staunch supporter of equal rights, but I recognize that I'm pretty ignorant about the day-to-day details of a trans person's life.

I'm probably going to be dumb and ask something that at least some of you will find ignorant or offensive.  I really don't mean to, please don't attack me for it.  I swear I'm here to learn and expand my mind.

I haven't historically really thought much about the possibility of dating someone who is trans, but I recently ran across a profile of a trans guy on a dating site and I really like how he talked about himself, I felt he was attractive, and he seemed like someone I would be interested in getting to know more.  (For the record, I completely recognize that he may have no interest in me.  I just want to be a little less ignorant before I even reach out to him to get to know him.)

I have only ever dated/been intimate with cis gay men.  I am definitely open to the idea of dating a trans guy, but I want to understand what that might mean.  From his pictures, he's clearly had top surgery (he has some shirtless pictures), but obviously I have no idea whether or not he has had bottom surgery.  My understanding is that it isn't appropriate to ask, and in the hypothetical of dating someone, I wouldn't even have any idea of when it becomes appropriate to discuss that.

The thing is, I have only ever been with guys that have penises.  I don't know how I would react to being with a guy that doesn't have one.  I would feel truly terrible if I started dating someone, we reached a point of getting emotionally invested, and then it turns out to be a problem.  I don't want to waste his time or hurt his feelings if this is something that's too much for me, but I don't know how to figure out if that would be the case.

How have transguys here dealt with inexperienced partners in the past?  Are there any cis gay men that have dealt with this here that could give me some insight?  Anyone have some useful advice?

In essence, the thought of dating someone transgender makes me realize that I don't fully understand my own sexuality.  I'm gay...but I don't know if that means I'm attracted to the male gender or the male sex.  I've never been in a position to challenge that because every person I have been with has been a cis male.

I'm still not sure if I'm actually genderqueer, or if it's some other non-cis thing, or if I'm just a cis guy who just doesn't like the way men are expected to act and look.

When people describe me as a girl, when they refer to me as she or call me ma'am, it sounds...wrong. It doesn't make me dysphoric, it just sounds inaccurate. 'He' is definitely not any better, and I'm not sure about 'they'- not really used to it. 

I've been kinda-sorta experimenting with a more masculine presentation, but it hasn't really expanded beyond wearing men's clothing. Problem is that I'm tiny, with decent curves and overall incredibly feminine features. No one will ever take me as anything other than a girl. Never.

Whenever I see men's clothing, I get really- I don't know if it's dysphoria, but I get incredibly disappointed and sad I can't wear those clothes because a. they don't work with my hips/shoulders/height and b. socially, I cannot wear a suit to a formal event. I just can't. It kind of makes me resent my body for not working with those clothes. And I wish I could wear them, because I really like suits. But wanting to wear men's clothes doesn't make me trans.

Frankly, I wouldn't mind looking like a male model. I wouldn't mind being a guy. But I'm a girl, I'm a female, and I'm also okay with that.

So basically, I have no idea if I'm trans or just gender non-conforming. And since I don't actually want to change my body, it kind of feels gross for me to appropriate the genderqueer label when all I want to do is be able to wear a well-fitted suit to something and not get any stares, or go to the men's restroom without it being weird. I want to be able to back and forth as much as I want.

Does anyone have any advice?

I'm 19, gender-fluid, and AMAB.

I have been looking at names. So many names. And after scouring the census and trawling various dark caverns of the internet, I came up a blank. 

I liked Taylor, but I have an ex named Taylor. Dakota is the name of a younger brother of my best friend. Emory is the name of a rather unfortunate tinder date. Rowan is what I would have been called had I been born female, but this is my choice, not theirs. 

When I'm in ""girlmode"" I tend to be pretty shy. My image of myself is of this girl brushing her hair over her ear while looking down and blushing (Which I apparently do a lot in girlmode.) I really like the name ""Lexi"" for that me. I also like ""Alexis"" for the less cute but still feminine me.

In ""guymode"" I look like an Alex. I've always liked the name Alexi/Alexei. I (although I will totally accept the inaccuracy and pretentiousness of this) love the meaning of Alexander. ""defender of man""

I spend most of my time neutral, so I want a name that is androgynous, and not super common. I liked both Alex and Lexi, but I can't ask people to use different names based on something invisible that sometimes changes up to 3 times a day. 

A*lex*. *Lex*i. A*lex*i. A*lex*is. A*lex*ander. *Lex*.

The people there lead me in the right direction, even if I didn't get an immediate answer. But the most important thing is, they helped me on the right path until the point I am 100 percent confident in what my sexuality is, and I can finally explain it to people instead of just shrugging. 

However, still after a few years I am shrugging about my gender. 

I have NO idea where I am on the scale. Not even a hint.

I am biologically female, with a very heavy male expression. Until very recently, I just thought I was heavy in the masculine side, but attached to my little bit a femininity. So I decided gender-fluid with heavy male gender expression. Letting people call me both he/she.

However, something changed: I suddenly have had heavy urges to explore my feminine side.

And what's weirder? I'm admiring the clothes, and wanting to try them on, but......I can't bring myself to do it.

I online roleplay as a hobby, and while my characters are usually ""comfortably feminine"" none of them were overly girly until recently. Suddenly, I really like playing very feminine females. In video games, I am exploring more feminine clothes options and more girly facial expressions.

So I came to the conclusion: I am exploring my gender identity through my hobbies rather than my identity.

Weird right? Someone who craves exploring their feminine side, but is not comfortable doing it.

And then to top it all off, I came to this conclusion that throws EVERYTHING into a curl ball.

**I wouldn't mind exploring my more feminine side if I was biologically male.**

I have no idea where my brain is going with my gender, how to even explain myself comfortably to family and friends. I have very accepting people around me when it comes to sex/gender, so it has nothing to do with that.

I know no one probably has the magic answers, but maybe directions to a town that might be able to help me? I am so lost and confused with myself...

61,2015-09-11 18:44:20,3kkppi,21,9,"My partner encountered something at work the other day that she wanted my opinion on.  During group introductions, everyone was asked to give their name and which pronouns they use.  One ostensibly cis woman said that she used she/her pronouns, but that if people wanted they could use they/them pronouns for her because ""it's a good way of practicing"".  My partner didn't say anything at the time, but thought it was kind of weird and potentially problematic, because some people could interpret it as a reinforcement of the idea that 'preferred' pronouns are optional, but being cis, she wanted to get my input.  My initial reaction when she told me about this was also that something about it wasn't quite right, but I'm having a hard time articulating why it rubs me the wrong way.  I have a couple of half-formed thoughts, and I welcome anyone else's opinions on the matter.

* It feels condescending somehow, as if gender-neutral pronouns are some sort of burden for cis people to use, and that they need to practice on someone for whom there is no negative consequence if they forget to use 'they'.  I get that not everyone is used to using they/them pronouns, and that it does require some practice, but for a cis person to say ""you can practice on me"" just feels off.
* I don't know where she got this idea, which makes me wonder whether she actually consulted anyone who uses they/them pronouns on whether this makes sense or not
* It feels kind of like she's making this all about herself and trying to score ally points while potentially not being very well-informed about how to be a good ally to trans/NB people
* If, on the other hand, she was given this advice by someone who actually is trans/NB, does that make it all okay even if it seems wrong to other trans/NB people?
* It's possible that she is questioning her identity and this feels like a safe way for her to try on different pronouns while she's figuring it out, although she seemed to suggest that this was not the case, but she could just not be ready to come out yet

During group introductions, everyone was asked to give their name and which pronouns they use.  One ostensibly cis woman said that she used she/her pronouns, but that if people wanted they could use they/them pronouns for her because ""it\'s a good way of practicing"".  My partner didn\'t say anything at the time, but thought it was kind of weird and potentially problematic, because some people could interpret it as a reinforcement of the idea that \'preferred\' pronouns are optional, but being cis, she wanted to get my input.  My initial reaction when she told me about this was also that something about it wasn\'t quite right, but I\'m having a hard time articulating why it rubs me the wrong way.  I have a couple of half-formed thoughts, and I welcome anyone else\'s opinions on the matter.\n\n* It feels condescending somehow, as if gender-neutral pronouns are some sort of burden for cis people to use, and that they need to practice on someone for whom there is no negative consequence if they forget to use \'they\'.  I get that not everyone is used to using they/them pronouns, and that it does require some practice, but for a cis person to say ""you can practice on me"" just feels off.\n* I don\'t know where she got this idea, which makes me wonder whether she actually consulted anyone who uses they/them pronouns on whether this makes sense or not\n* It feels kind of like she\'s making this all about herself and trying to score ally points while potentially not being very well-informed about how to be a good ally to trans/NB people\n* If, on the other hand, she was given this advice by someone who actually is trans/NB, does that make it all okay even if it seems wrong to other trans/NB people?\n* It\'s possible that she is questioning her identity and this feels like a safe way for her to try on different pronouns while she\'s figuring it out, although she seemed to suggest that this was not the case, but she could just not be ready to come out yet\n* I wasn\'t actually present for this, and am hearing everything second-hand, and so it\'s possible that I\'m only reading it as inappropriate because my partner described it that way\n\nI actually [commented](https://np.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/2g3u7m/cis_friend_suggested_allies_use_gender_neutral/ckfevc8) on a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/2g3u7m/cis_friend_suggested_allies_use_gender_neutral/) about a similar situation about a year ago, but there are enough subtle differences and a lack of knowledge about this woman\'s motivations for doing this that I\'m less sure about how to feel about this situation.

So far I'm still confused on what I am, but thankfully things have been less stressful than they were in the beginning. I decided to try something that would make me feel less ""masculine"" I guess you could say. I pretty much shaved 80% of my body hair off (admittedly I've always hated the stuff, what purpose does it have anyway?). Legs, arms, stomach (thank whatever god is in the sky for my lack of chest hair), all shaved completely. Don't regret it at all. Actually, I feel a lot better without it. My gender shifts became pretty rare afterwards, almost to the point I don't notice 'em at all if they did happen. 

It's been a month since my last gender shift, which is around the time I started this whole shaving thing. Felt male pretty much since. Though occasionally It'll switch for a few minutes or an hour and then go back to ""normal"" the rest of the week. 

Overall I'm a lot happier now.

I still haven't ruled out the possibility of me being somewhere in the trans* umbrella, but right now I'm just gonna rejoice in the fact I can wake up in the morning and look at myself in the mirror without feeling horrible.

So yeah, that's what I've been up to for the past month or 2. Thanks for reading and have a good day/night/whatever time it is you're reading this. :)

I am a 19 year old (AMAB) and I have struggled with my gender since I was a small kid. It's been something on my mind for the span of my existence and especially for the past 5 years it's been a source of major confusion and anxiety.  

I have gone through periods of my life thinking I was mtf transgender, but upon doing so I've always felt like something was a bit off. You see, I have never particularly disliked my male body; naturally, I have a feminine body for someone born a male, so that may be of some help in the dysphoria department of things. The same goes for my male genitalia. While I find my testicles to be a major annoyance, I am quite content with my penis. Furthermore, I find my male self quite attractive, and my self-esteem has developed quite healthy.

All of this has left me confused, but after a lot of deep thought and blocking out all outside influences from my head on the subject, I have come to realize what I want.  

Basically, in plainest words, picture a cis girl with male genitalia and no breasts. That's what I want and what I think will make me happy and to put this to rest for once in my life.  

So realizing this has been a relief to me, as I feel like I can finally put my life-long confusion stage to rest and move on, but alas I have now found a new hurdle. How to go about getting what I want.  

Basically, I would love to get an orchi and be done with testosterone and then get estrogen, but I am concerned about breasts growth. I come from a family of women with very large breasts (all of my immediate female relatives are DD's despite also being skinny). So if the information that I've gathered is accurate, there's a good chance I'll be left with C cups (of course YMMV always but statistically speaking I'll probably be on the larger side of things). Also, another concern is breast cancer, as my grandmother had it several times within her life, and I don't want to increase my chances.  

Another option is just getting an orchi, but that leaves me susceptible to depression and osteoporosis (and loss of libido, but I would actually like that), not to mention finding a willing doctor.

Once again, I'm left not knowing what I should do and I'm scared I am never going to resolve this thing. It's been a burden all throughout my childhood and now into my adulthood and I just want a resolution.

I can deal with stuff so much better, and actually look forward to things that will happen in the future, instead of concentrating on how to survive the present and dreading what might come next. 

I've posted some of my correspondence with my doctors here before and am doing so again, in case it helps someone in a similar situation. T is not for everyone. However, I've seen so few narratives that talk about using it for primarily mental, instead of physical, benefit, so I wanted to put this out there.

&gt; SUMMARY: I decreased testosterone dose back to one pump and am very happy with results. Total testosterone is [number], is this unusually high for my dose? [unrelated health issue question]

&gt; Dr. [endo] -

&gt; It's been a month since I started testosterone (August 13) and I wanted to update you how things were going, and ask questions about my latest bloodwork (sent in separate message). I realize this has turned out to be very long, but as your first openly nonbinary patient I want to give you as much info as I can in case it helps patients of yours in the future.

&gt; A week after I started, I (with your go-ahead) increased my gel dose to two pumps. While on that dose, I felt out of balance - better than no T for sure, but instead of calm and happy I felt agitated and irritable. After five days I dropped back down to one pump and the happy calmness returned immediately, so I've been sticking with this dose since. 

&gt; I found the blog of someone who has been taking my same gel dose for over two years (http://janitorqueer.com/tag/testosterone/ for relevant posts). They have had only slight physical changes in that time. I know everyone's body reacts differently, but it's slightly disappointing to know that this dose may not give me appreciable physical changes. However, it does what I originally wanted it to do, which is fix my mental functioning.

&gt; I have not seen many obvious physical changes. I've had slight genital growth, with most of it occurring during the five days of increased dose. Voice has not lowered noticeably, though throat has been feeling weird. During an unrelated doctor visit, my blood pressure was slightly elevated (nothing worrisome; just that I almost always have ""perfect"" blood pressure). I'm getting more pimples, especially on my right shoulder where I apply the gel. If it gets bothersome I'll just switch to my left shoulder. I got sick with a sore throat a few weeks in (tested negative for strep), which I have heard might be common when people start T. Sex drive has increased noticeably but not dramatically (except when I was on two pumps, no surprise there). Honestly the worst side-effect has been constipation. It was a real problem on two pumps, but at one pump it is manageable with judicious consumption of coffee.

&gt; In terms of mental effects, T is the absolute best ""antidepressant"" I've ever taken. It's like night and day. Instead of spending all my mental energy coping with life and just barely treading water, I've been able to spend it LIVING. I simultaneously have more mental energy, and also need to spend less of it to deal with unpleasant things. I'm going through a very stressful period at work/school and while it hasn't been enjoyable, I'm able to be productive, whereas I would have been completely debilitated by something like this pre-T. I have also felt much less dysphoric, both in general and towards triggers that in the past would have really bugged me. These factors have pretty much convinced me that my hypothesis of my brain expecting a certain hormone mixture was correct, and also that my gender is masculine-of-center but still non-binary (as opposed to fully FtM; if I were completely male, I think I'd be less okay with possibly not getting the physical changes). To sum up, I am very happy with the results of a dose of one pump per day.

&gt; [bloodwork timing details]

&gt; DHEA-sulfate is still elevated [more than twice “female” levels] and erratic, as it has been for quite some time. Estradiol is [number in “female” range] pg/mL, down from around [number*1.5 but still in “female” range] pre-T, but that may have to do with time of cycle. [unrelated health issue stuff]

&gt; The testosterone test surprised me. My total testosterone increased from [“female” levels] in July to [more than 10 times that] now (solidly in the male range?). This blood drawing was taken ~1.5 hours after I applied the T (near peak blood levels for the day), so that may have something to do with it. Also, this panel doesn't seem to be exactly the same test as was done end of July (that one was [code] and calculates bioavailable T; this one was [different code] and calculates free T), but I hope the numbers we need are in there. Given my ""super-low dose"" are any of these numbers worrying and/or interesting?

&gt; I'll schedule a follow-up once my insurance is ironed out. Until then, feedback regarding [unrelated health issue] and T levels is appreciated.

I have a fear that if I express myself too femininely, the people I am most attracted to will start becoming less attracted to me.  I also am not super attached to details about my appearance.

I think part of this fear is irrational, because past partners have tended to react positively when I've crossed gender norms.

123,2015-09-20 23:46:01,3lqkul,10,11,"Hi, so this is a bit of a rant I guess. A bit of venting. I've been with my husband for 7 years, and we got married a couple of weeks ago amidst my gender struggles. I love him dearly and know that he loves me, but I'm getting seriously frustrated with his lack of empathy, compassion or attempts at understanding my gender struggles.

Up until the last year or so, I'd never really known that nonbinary genders exist so I was never able to articulate my gender to him. I always assumed that being trans was a thing that other, more confident people were. People who it was obvious for from childhood. Any and all attempts by me to say ""no, I'm not female"" have been met with replies ""don't be silly, of course you are"" from all parties.

But now I know, now I understand. I'm finally equipped with the knowledge and vocabulary to explain the internal struggle that has been plaguing me for years.

To him, a straight cisgender man, me being a nonbinary gender is a phase that came out of the blue, and he is really struggling to understand. Don't get me wrong, he's an amazing man. He's kind, caring, funny, open-minded (at least when it comes to other people), and we have an awesome bond. He is an amazing dad, a caring partner, a wonderful human being who wouldn't hurt a soul. But there is just that one thing that is grating at me - his insistence that this is a phase.

Him saying things in response to serious discussions I've tried to have, such as:
""I'm still going to call you my wife,""
""If we were out in public and you were presenting male and tried to hold my hand or kiss me, I would feel embarrassed.""
""From my point of view, you went to your friend's house one day and came back insisting you were a boy.""
""Your name is Hannah, and you are a woman, so I'm going to call you Hannah and I'm not going to stop referring to you as she because it's weird.""
""This gender thing is just another one of your little ideas that you will forget about in a few months.""

It's getting to me. I don't know how to explain it to him any clearer: I have always felt this way. I have proof from multiple friends that it's not the first time I've felt this way; in the past I have told people that I am not female, but no one has ever taken it seriously. I just didn't know how to explain it until now. I will not be changing my body or taking hormones if you don't want me to, because I want to have another child some day, it's convenient, and I know you are a straight man who finds my female body attractive. But it doesn't stop me from wanting to tear off my boobs or strap them down. It doesn't stop me from needing to be talked to and talked about using the correct phrases, words and pronouns. It doesn't stop me from wishing beyond anything that I wasn't so damn curvy, that I could grow a beard, that I didn't hate what I see every time I look in the mirror, and it doesn't stop my gender from being nonbinary.

A bit of venting. I\'ve been with my husband for 7 years, and we got married a couple of weeks ago amidst my gender struggles. I love him dearly and know that he loves me, but I\'m getting seriously frustrated with his lack of empathy, compassion or attempts at understanding my gender struggles.\n\nUp until the last year or so, I\'d never really known that nonbinary genders exist so I was never able to articulate my gender to him. I always assumed that being trans was a thing that other, more confident people were. People who it was obvious for from childhood. Any and all attempts by me to say ""no, I\'m not female"" have been met with replies ""don\'t be silly, of course you are"" from all parties.\n\nBut now I know, now I understand. I\'m finally equipped with the knowledge and vocabulary to explain the internal struggle that has been plaguing me for years.\n\nTo him, a straight cisgender man, me being a nonbinary gender is a phase that came out of the blue, and he is really struggling to understand. Don\'t get me wrong, he\'s an amazing man. He\'s kind, caring, funny, open-minded (at least when it comes to other people), and we have an awesome bond. He is an amazing dad, a caring partner, a wonderful human being who wouldn\'t hurt a soul. But there is just that one thing that is grating at me - his insistence that this is a phase.\n\nHim saying things in response to serious discussions I\'ve tried to have, such as:\n""I\'m still going to call you my wife,""\n""If we were out in public and you were presenting male and tried to hold my hand or kiss me, I would feel embarrassed.""\n""From my point of view, you went to your friend\'s house one day and came back insisting you were a boy.""\n""Your name is Hannah, and you are a woman, so I\'m going to call you Hannah and I\'m not going to stop referring to you as she because it\'s weird.""\n""This gender thing is just another one of your little ideas that you will forget about in a few months.""\n\nIt\'s getting to me. I don\'t know how to explain it to him any clearer: I have always felt this way. I have proof from multiple friends that it\'s not the first time I\'ve felt this way; in the past I have told people that I am not female, but no one has ever taken it seriously. I just didn\'t know how to explain it until now. I will not be changing my body or taking hormones if you don\'t want me to, because I want to have another child some day, it\'s convenient, and I know you are a straight man who finds my female body attractive. But it doesn\'t stop me from wanting to tear off my boobs or strap them down. It doesn\'t stop me from needing to be talked to and talked about using the correct phrases, words and pronouns. It doesn\'t stop me from wishing beyond anything that I wasn\'t so damn curvy, that I could grow a beard, that I didn\'t hate what I see every time I look in the mirror, and it doesn\'t stop my gender from being nonbinary. Possibly even a trans man. Because my body and my brain do not match.\n\nAll I\'m asking is for you to try and be more empathetic, try not to belittle me or my brain just because you don\'t understand, and PLEASE stop rolling your eyes every time I fill out a form using Mx instead of Mrs or Ms.\n\nRant over.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Partner (husband) struggling to accept me', 'created': 1442817961.0}"

So I'm going to try and keep this short (ETA, NOT SHORT), but I've been questioning my gender identity for a few months now. I'm AFAB, 19 and Bisexual. I volunteer at a LGBTQA+ community and have been exposed to so many different kinds of people and it's helped me learn a lot about myself, but I have yet to bring this up with my GF/GQ friends for fear of offending them. Being in this community also makes me worry I'm just jumping on a bandwagon and trying to be ""trendy"". Help.

I dress fairly androgynously, though with 32C's, shoulder length hair and other feminine features, most people just call me a tomboy and I leave it at that. It's not that I don't like womens clothes, I've never tried to bind (I like my girls), it's just that I feel more comfortable wearing neutral clothing. I only wear dresses to formal events, any other day it's jeans/shorts/sometimes skirts and a t-shirt. I despise low cut tops, but mens shirts are hard for me to fit into without altering (have to buy large and tailor small for chest and shoulder reasons) so I mainly just buy neutral girls clothes. I bought my first pair of guys jeans the other week and am waiting for it to be cool enough outside to wear them, but I wear them in private and they make me happy. I also have a few pairs of boxers that I wear when lounging around the house (the loose fit is comfortable, but I prefer girls panties when actually getting ready for the day because boxers get scrunched up in fitted jeans) and I love them. I've thought of cutting my hair short to better fit my personality, but I'm also really attached to the curls and refuse to chop more off than I have to. In short, I'm fairly noticeably female and have no desire to change my body to conform to an androgynous lifestyle, but because of this, everything I wear looks feminine, or at best tomboy. This discrepancy is one of the #1 reasons I question my identity. Am I just a female who likes dressing a certain way, or am I genderfluid who doesn't want to change their body to conform with a stereotype?

Now to my childhood bit. I'll say it now, me being a girl was a big problem. My father was out of my life by 7, and dead by 9. I was a daddys girl, but that stopped at a really young age. My mother grew up in an abusive household where her brother was more valued for being a boy and she was disposable because she was a girl. She carried this attitude on, along with the abuse, to my childhood. My brother was adored, my sister took an incredible amount of verbal abuse. Dad did nothing to stop it. When they moved out when I was 5, I was the next plaything. My little girl cuteness only saved me from so much, and I was only allowed to be female while my dad was still around. When my mother and I lived alone, any behavior that my mother didn't like was strongly rebuked verbally and physically. I learned to behave as she wanted me to, which included a lot of stereotypical male behavior. I didn't voluntarily wear a dress from 7 to 18 ( I say voluntarily because she would literally make me wear dresses in public as punishment and at 15 she bought handfuls of dresses that I feigned interest in because I knew anything else would get me beat) I now own four dresses that I really like, but it still takes a lot for me to wear them. I'm warming up to skirts, but they have to be knee length and loose.

But anyway, childhood. I had two step-nephews close to my age. One was 6 years older, one a year younger and I grew up with them as if they were brothers. The oldest was very macho, the youngest was more feminine. The eldest protected me, I protected the youngest. I would wear their clothes, rough-house with them and played sports with them. I remember one easter wearing a guys button-up and corduroy pants. I grew thinking I was one of the guys and this was in turn re-enforced through my mother. Basically, I was a substitute-guy for the majority of my childhood. That changed at puberty. Then, my mother tried to make me female and I really had no choice in the matter. I wore more feminine clothes in public and was made to wear makeup and ill-fitting bras. I was also repeatedly told being a girl was still a very bad thing and that I would be raped by every man I met. I'm still working through this. I learned to fear and despise being a woman in an entirely new and different way. I was taken out of school at ten so I never got to explore my sexuality except through romance books and porn which were all very hetero-normative. It wasn't until seeing a bisexual character in a tv show at 15 that I was finally able to pinpoint why I liked both genders and that it was ok. Of course, telling my mother brought on more abuse and I never got to actually date outside of the man I would currently be engaged to if it werent for our long-distance situation. Basically, I was locked up and abused for my entire life until I ran away at 18 and found my community where I actually was able to learn about myself and find out that it was ok being different. I am still working through the misogyny I grew up with, but I know what was done was wrong and that being female is ok. And yet, I still am more comfortable being masculine and largely reject feminine things...except for that part of that actually really likes being feminine and fuck it's confusing.

Like, I sometimes like to dress up, but it takes a lot of courage. I know part of this is the dysphoria I was forced to grow up with, but I am also trying to accept where I am now and that is that I actually like being able to be either male or female depending on my mood. My boyfriend says dating me is basically dating a guy in a womans body and he loves my male and female sides equally. He encourages it actually and was the one to coax me to buying a pair of guys jeans. He's a very strange man, but in a good way. Very supportive.

This went way longer than I thought it would, but it's helped. I feel less scared and more certain, but I still have my reservations. I guess I'm still trying to figure out if this just makes me a female with non-stereotypical behavior, a special snowflake, or an honest Genderfluid with issues. Can anyone here help me figure this out?

I am genderqueer and I will continue to fight gender stereotypes and the likes, but some things have been bothering me for quite some time and I would like to talk about it.

What if we're wrong?

By that I mean, I feel like a lot about the genderqueer theory is make believe. It's a movement that praises individuality and free-expression, the embrace of the true self and the acceptance of people like us.

I have yet to find many reliable scientific source about the subject, and I find the people in the movement (including myself and my close friends) are just jerking each other off.

Pronouns, identity, gender neutrality, safe spaces... I question the true validity of those things. I could go on in details if needed.

It seems like everyone in the movement agrees with each other without asking questions. I tend to be left a bit out because of my unsure (but maybe justified?) questions.

I started to notice patterns in the members of our community. Man-hating geeky transbians, sex-thirsty cis-dudes in dresses, crustpunk lesbians who loooove astrology (why astrology of all things, by the way? Seems unrelated...)

The patterns I've noticed aren't founded in statistics, just something I've noticed on my own so I assume they are to be taken with a grain of salt. But this leads to a question: Are we just all copying each other?

I don't think that I am questioning the validity of the queerness of people as much as I am questioning the inner-circle's capacity for individual thought.

With that comes, the validity of opinions in the queer spaces.
It feels like everyone I've come across have had a really strong opinion against things that really shouldn't matter at all when it comes to the grand schemes of things. For example, why is calling yourself an egalitarianist such a bad thing when it's basically the same as what we believe as a whole?

I guess what I am asking really is this:

Does queer theory hold any grounds in scientific and/or social studies and/or genetics?
Is the lack of free-thought from genderqueers just an impression from my personal experiences and circles or is it real and/or experienced by other people?
Am I just being stupid?

Thanks for reading. Please keep in mind... I just want to have a discussion. I'm not here to troll, make people uncomfortable or anything.

182,2015-09-29 03:54:17,3msihb,7,19,"I don't feel like I belong in the ""man"" category, but I don't feel any more kinship with ""woman."" So, for the last three or so years, I've been trying on how it feels to call myself genderqueer. It seems to fit well enough, mostly. But I'm getting to the point where I am considering starting HRT and possibly a getting very substantial breast reduction, and before I make any drastic changes, I want to be as sure as I can be that I'm not doing this for the wrong reasons, since I know I have a few other issues that might get tangled into this.

I say I don't feel like a man or a woman, but I will admit having felt the same about basically every other group of people I've met. Since I was about 11 or so, I've never felt a sense of belonging or kinship with a group, despite desperately trying to find a place that I fit in. I know that I have pretty severe social anxiety that can make me very awkward in many social situations--maybe I've just been too wrapped up in how frightening social situations are to feel connected with a group, or maybe I've just been putting everyone off. Regardless, I'm having a difficult time shaking off the doubt that maybe I've blown up the whole thing in my head into some kind of ""special snowflake"" situation.

My second concern is that maybe the underlying reason I'm so uncomfortable with being considered a ""woman"" is because I associate it with weakness and vulnerability. I've been subject to the usual North American WASP socialization, and I know that I've struggled for quite a few years to throw off tons of internalized misogyny. On top of that, I've been sexually abused several times by ""friends"" that I had previously trusted, and it's hard to shake off the nagging thought that if I hadn't had this stupid body with its huge breasts and curved hips, that maybe I wouldn't be a target.

The next question, then, is do these reasons even matter? Even knowing these biases, I still look at myself and imagine how great it would feel if people would call me ""they"" or ""sir"" or stop staring at my breasts before my face or how much more like myself I'd feel if a woman's voice wouldn't come out every time I speak. But is that just delusion talking? In ten, twenty, thirty years, am I going to look down at myself and be disgusted at the scars on my chest and the body hair, and feel like a freak when a stranger on the telephone mistakes my low voice for a male one?

I just don't know. I don't know whether what I'm feeling is really dysphoria or just a peculiar alignment of other problems, or if this is going to go away in a few months or a few years. Maybe one day I'll wake up and be happy in my skin and slide perfectly into the woman-shaped hole society has made for me. Or maybe I'll just keep feeling like this forever, eternally out of place in society and my family and even my own body.

I think what I really need is to talk to a therapist about this, but writing this out helps a little.

Lately my levels of dysphoria have been happening more and lasting longer, but only one way, even I'm forced to present male due to family/job but my brain is in full ""girl mode"". 

My main point is that lately I have been considering seeing a therapist related to gender identity issues, and possibly going on hrt to help develop a more feminine body, to  help with dysphoric days. I don't have genital dysphoric issues at all, if I were to ever decide full transition, I would keep what I have. Even presenting as and identifying as male when I enjoy and am comfortable with that, I still prefer a more lithe and androgenised appearance, so I think the changes physically from hrt would be welcome even to the male parts of myself. 


I guess what I really am saying is that I don't know if I need to take further steps or not. But just the act of writing this out has brought many emotions to the surface. 

Feedback welcome, will be crossposting on r\Trans

I'll try to summarize as best as I can!

My child was born female. Always a very very girly child, loved dresses, makeup, fashion. Was even a very girly cheerleader last year. Always an A+ student and in tons of sports. early spring of 2015 all her grades dropped and she quit every sport. In May 2015 (OMG has it only been 4 months??) my 12yr old daughter needed a haircut. Her face is very nicely framed with a pixie cut so I pushed for a pixie cut, she really didn't want it because she said she liked her long pretty hair. Well she finally agreed the cut was nice and got it. About a week later she sits me down and tells me shes pansexual and is gender fluid. She said she learned that word from a website and the only research she had done was reading one paragraph online about it but it sounded correct so she self diagnosed. 

So immediately got her a therapist. She met with the therapist privately a couple times then we met together. I was totally shocked to find out the therapist was coaching her on how to transition to a boy full time. Got to the bottom of it all, turns out my daughter had presented it as shes been transgender her whole life and wants to be a boy and got her haircut as a boy as her first transition step. News to me and a total and utter shock and didn't match the story she told me. 

She told me she still identified as gender fluid and wanted to be called Spencer, as it's a gender neutral name. wanting to support her an show love and acceptance I agreed. 

So school starts in August and she tells all her teachers she is now a boy and goes by Spencer. So all the teachers have a meeting and call in me to join them. They are all super supportive (which is amazing) but I jusst feel things are moving way too fast, and still don't make since. Her story changes and I feel like different people are getting different stories. The teachers are asking me how I want to proceed and I just don't know. I want the brakes put on! I want to give this time and figure out what's going on with my child. Where do I turn? who do I ask for help?

One of the biggest things I keep coming back to is how I'm not comfortable with who I am, physically. I often find myself thinking ""holy shit, I'm a real person, this is what I look like, I had no idea!"" and am constantly surprised that I never look how I feel and it often is very both distressing and disorientating. To give you a bit of an idea, I've got the build of Jared Leto meets Christian Bale, but often feel more along the lines of a Ruby Rose. I find myself feeling less and less masculine everyday and more androgynous or feminine, often fluctuating between the two; although rarely I still do feel masculine and am at least comfortable in my body when I feel that way.

I've heavily thought about transitioning as I just feel I would be so much happier and more comfortable with both who I am physically and as a person, but at the same time I'm absolutely terrified of both commitment and somehow just fucking it up. I know for those days I do feel Masculine, if I were to transition MtF, it would be so much easier to look more on the masculine side of androgyny (if that makes sense?) and would still feel rather satisfied with myself. 

I know this is a rather silly question to ask since it's about personal feelings, but, would that be a decent thing to do? Or is there an easier way to simply get by?

31,2015-09-19 06:18:51,3lj1nf,0,3,"I've stopped analyzing myself and tried to start accepting myself. Analyzing has lead me to doubt myself. It's harmful to me and not helpful to anyone else. Only through failing to be 'textbook' did I realize I could be 'poem' instead. I could be book and text, but only if I had space. Space to have my own narrative. Space to be ambiguous and ever changing. 

I came out as a trans man and realized it was a mistake. After coming out to everyone on Facebook, I had an empty semester to kill starting in the middle of winter. I had gone through genderqueer and non-binary, but I had a long period when I was exploring my identity where I felt mostly male, discovered I looked less awkward and felt better with a masculine gender presentation, and was considering some form of physical transitioning to alleviate dysphoria about my shape and voice. When I first came out as non-binary to my mother she dismissed they as a pronoun. Several of the feminist adult women in my life told me that I was confusing gender roles and personality with actual gender. Having been a feminist most of my life, it was frustrating. As I shifted in a more masculine direction I realized I might want to take testosterone. I began listening to Tumblr ""truscum"" who traded their open-mindedness for security in their own opinions, and I needed security in something. Because I wanted a penis, I was, by their definition, a trans man. I tried to silence my inner ambiguity and failed.

I had gone through genderqueer and non-binary, but I had a long period when I was exploring my identity where I felt mostly male, discovered I looked less awkward and felt better with a masculine gender presentation, and was considering some form of physical transitioning to alleviate dysphoria about my shape and voice. When I first came out as non-binary to my mother she dismissed they as a pronoun. Several of the feminist adult women in my life told me that I was confusing gender roles and personality with actual gender. Having been a feminist most of my life, it was frustrating. As I shifted in a more masculine direction I realized I might want to take testosterone.

36,2015-09-21 17:25:00,3ltu6o,3,4,"So I'm going to try and keep this short (ETA, NOT SHORT), but I've been questioning my gender identity for a few months now. I'm AFAB, 19 and Bisexual. I volunteer at a LGBTQA+ community and have been exposed to so many different kinds of people and it's helped me learn a lot about myself, but I have yet to bring this up with my GF/GQ friends for fear of offending them. Being in this community also makes me worry I'm just jumping on a bandwagon and trying to be ""trendy"". Help.

I dress fairly androgynously, though with 32C's, shoulder length hair and other feminine features, most people just call me a tomboy and I leave it at that. It's not that I don't like womens clothes, I've never tried to bind (I like my girls), it's just that I feel more comfortable wearing neutral clothing. I only wear dresses to formal events, any other day it's jeans/shorts/sometimes skirts and a t-shirt. I despise low cut tops, but mens shirts are hard for me to fit into without altering (have to buy large and tailor small for chest and shoulder reasons) so I mainly just buy neutral girls clothes. I bought my first pair of guys jeans the other week and am waiting for it to be cool enough outside to wear them, but I wear them in private and they make me happy. I also have a few pairs of boxers that I wear when lounging around the house (the loose fit is comfortable, but I prefer girls panties when actually getting ready for the day because boxers get scrunched up in fitted jeans) and I love them. I've thought of cutting my hair short to better fit my personality, but I'm also really attached to the curls and refuse to chop more off than I have to. In short, I'm fairly noticeably female and have no desire to change my body to conform to an androgynous lifestyle, but because of this, everything I wear looks feminine, or at best tomboy. This discrepancy is one of the #1 reasons I question my identity. Am I just a female who likes dressing a certain way, or am I genderfluid who doesn't want to change their body to conform with a stereotype? 

Now to my childhood bit. I'll say it now, me being a girl was a big problem. My father was out of my life by 7, and dead by 9. I was a daddys girl, but that stopped at a really young age. My mother grew up in an abusive household where her brother was more valued for being a boy and she was disposable because she was a girl. She carried this attitude on, along with the abuse, to my childhood. My brother was adored, my sister took an incredible amount of verbal abuse. Dad did nothing to stop it. When they moved out when I was 5, I was the next plaything. My little girl cuteness only saved me from so much, and I was only allowed to be female while my dad was still around. When my mother and I lived alone, any behavior that my mother didn't like was strongly rebuked verbally and physically. I learned to behave as she wanted me to, which included a lot of stereotypical male behavior. I didn't voluntarily wear a dress from 7 to 18 ( I say voluntarily because she would literally make me wear dresses in public as punishment and at 15 she bought handfuls of dresses that I feigned interest in because I knew anything else would get me beat) I now own four dresses that I really like, but it still takes a lot for me to wear them. I'm warming up to skirts, but they have to be knee length and loose. 

But anyway, childhood. I had two step-nephews close to my age. One was 6 years older, one a year younger and I grew up with them as if they were brothers. The oldest was very macho, the youngest was more feminine. The eldest protected me, I protected the youngest. I would wear their clothes, rough-house with them and played sports with them. I remember one easter wearing a guys button-up and corduroy pants. I grew thinking I was one of the guys and this was in turn re-enforced through my mother. Basically, I was a substitute-guy for the majority of my childhood. That changed at puberty. Then, my mother tried to make me female and I really had no choice in the matter. I wore more feminine clothes in public and was made to wear makeup and ill-fitting bras. I was also repeatedly told being a girl was still a very bad thing and that I would be raped by every man I met. I'm still working through this. I learned to fear and despise being a woman in an entirely new and different way. I was taken out of school at ten so I never got to explore my sexuality except through romance books and porn which were all very hetero-normative. It wasn't until seeing a bisexual character in a tv show at 15 that I was finally able to pinpoint why I liked both genders and that it was ok. Of course, telling my mother brought on more abuse and I never got to actually date outside of the man I would currently be engaged to if it werent for our long-distance situation. Basically, I was locked up and abused for my entire life until I ran away at 18 and found my community where I actually was able to learn about myself and find out that it was ok being different. I am still working through the misogyny I grew up with, but I know what was done was wrong and that being female is ok. And yet, I still am more comfortable being masculine and largely reject feminine things...except for that part of that actually *really* likes being feminine and fuck it's confusing.

Like, I sometimes like to dress up, but it takes a lot of courage. I know part of this is the dysphoria I was forced to grow up with, but I am also trying to accept where I am now and that is that I *actually like being able to be either male or female depending on my mood*. My boyfriend says dating me is basically dating a guy in a womans body and he loves my male and female sides equally. He encourages it actually and was the one to coax me to buying a pair of guys jeans. He's a very strange man, but in a good way. Very supportive. 

This went way longer than I thought it would, but it's helped. I feel less scared and more certain, but I still have my reservations. I guess I'm still trying to figure out if this just makes me a female with non-stereotypical behavior, a special snowflake, or an honest Genderfluid with issues.

45,2015-09-28 18:47:25,3mqe63,2,5,"Hi everyone,

About a year or so ago, I posted a request here for people to consider participating in a research study. I was interested in how experiences of being discriminated against, internalized transphobia, and worries about potential discrimination might impact mental health (for example, depression and thoughts of suicide). I also wanted to know how support from family and friends might help to protect against depression. A number of you requested that when I completed the project I post back on here what I found. So I’m writing with an update on that study and wanted to share the findings here. 

In short, what we found (perhaps unsurprisingly to many of you) is that experiences of being discriminated against, feelings related to internalized transphobia, and worries/concerns about the potential for discrimination were all related to higher levels of depression. Depression in turn was strongly related to greater suicidality. An interesting finding, I think, is that internalized transphobia was also directly related to suicidality, even after accounting for depression. In other words, while experiences of discrimination and worries about discrimination only related to depression and not suicide when examined at the same time, internalized transphobia related to both. This is important because it demonstrates just how much of an impact negative feelings about one’s own gender identity can have. Another interesting finding was that support from friends was associated with lower levels of depression, but support from family was not related to anything. However, I think that particular finding may have been related to how we measured family support, so I’m not sure that we can draw many conclusions from that right now. 

For those of you who took the survey, you may also remember answering questions about drug use and alcohol use: for the most part, drug and alcohol use were not particularly relevant to either your experiences or to mental health. And finally, we compared the results across different trans subgroups. It’s hard to draw definitive conclusions without larger numbers of participants, but based on what we did have, it doesn’t seem as though these findings were different between groups.

If anyone has any questions at all about any of this or has any comments, please feel free to post here or get in touch with me directly at etebbe2@unl.edu.

",genderfluid,Follow up on research study participation request - findings!,1443491245.0,"{'created_utc': 1443466045, 'id': '3mqe63', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Hi everyone,\n\nAbout a year or so ago, I posted a request here for people to consider participating in a research study. I was interested in how experiences of being discriminated against, internalized transphobia, and worries about potential discrimination might impact mental health (for example, depression and thoughts of suicide). I also wanted to know how support from family and friends might help to protect against depression. A number of you requested that when I completed the project I post back on here what I found. So I’m writing with an update on that study and wanted to share the findings here. \n\nIn short, what we found (perhaps unsurprisingly to many of you) is that experiences of being discriminated against, feelings related to internalized transphobia, and worries/concerns about the potential for discrimination were all related to higher levels of depression. Depression in turn was strongly related to greater suicidality. An interesting finding, I think, is that internalized transphobia was also directly related to suicidality, even after accounting for depression. In other words, while experiences of discrimination and worries about discrimination only related to depression and not suicide when examined at the same time, internalized transphobia related to both. This is important because it demonstrates just how much of an impact negative feelings about one’s own gender identity can have. Another interesting finding was that support from friends was associated with lower levels of depression, but support from family was not related to anything. However, I think that particular finding may have been related to how we measured family support, so I’m not sure that we can draw many conclusions from that right now. \n\nFor those of you who took the survey, you may also remember answering questions about drug use and alcohol use: for the most part, drug and alcohol use were not particularly relevant to either your experiences or to mental health.
