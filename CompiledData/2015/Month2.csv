A friend of mine in the local community is taking some pretty heavy flak for their work helping address some horrible misogynistic bullshit at a university the work at. They are being bashed in the media and worse over violently misgendered (they identify as a nonbinary transperson, and some transphobic assholes make that grounds for attack). This as left them obviously upset and dysphoric. 

I myself being a transgirl combat the dysphoria I feel by doing gender affirming things like wearing something pretty or doing my makeup really well, but this has raised the question for me so I thought I'd ask this community: as a person who is nonbinary what do you do to help you cope? What kind of self-care do you employ to easy any dysphoric feelings?

Also I'd like to know for future use if there is anything I can do to better support nonbinary people and help be affirming to them? Obviously I use pronouns as requested, but I'd love to know any way I can support my NB community better. 

Thanks for reading!

I'm 19 years old right now, FAAB, but I always knew something was different about me. I could probably ramble on about the different phases I went through up until now, of being confused about myself and thinking my masculine affinities were just tomboyish hobbies... But a few months ago, I finally mustered up the courage to get a shorter haircut (albeit it's still kinda feminine because the stylist was being stubborn with me), and something clicked in me. It was as if a puzzle piece fell into place, and I realized why I connected with the trans* population as heavily as I did. 

So here I am. I went through a lot of time thinking I was just an ally, so I'm sorta superficially/politically educated on what it means to be trans*, but I'm still confused on the personal level. ESPECIALLY because I don't have genital dysphoria right now -- just chest. Would I classify as transgender, and/or FtM, and/or something else...?

I'm also quite fearful of passing and coming out in the future heh, as I'm sure most folks are. I've but a tiny yet curvy 5'4"" frame lol... And I have NO idea how to come out to my friends. I'm supposed to move in with two of them this Summer, so I can only hope they'd be accepting of me.

Another issue is that I can't afford to take any sorts of transitioning steps on my own, even if it means buying new clothes.

10,2015-02-05 04:25:55,2uu6fr,17,25,"I'm writing this post to get something off of my chest that's been a psychological burden for over 20 years.

First, a quick biography. I am, and have always been biologically, socially and instinctually male. I'm into ""boy"" things like technology, programming and gaming. I wear ""boy"" clothes. I'm not gay, I like girls wear a goatee... You get the idea, pretty basic Western Society Male™. I'm posting this anonymously because, for all intents and purposes, that's how things are going to remain.

But this would be a pretty dumb thing to post if there wasn't a hook, so, here it is: I've come to the conclusion that I suffer from Gender Dysphoria. There, I said it. It is, and has been (at least subconsciously,) for as long as it matters, my belief that I should have been born a girl.

I've always hated the fact that I'm a male, though I didn't always know it so specifically. For a long time, I thought I hated that I was human at all. Over time I was able to realise that this view was over-broad as, as a male, I only have the one perspective to go on.

At first the signs of my disphoria were slight, and easy to miss. Things like enjoying the times I could gender swap the stuffed animal character I played with my sister, or playing the girl character with friends, or ""Man... wouldn't it be simply BEST to have Ranma's curse..."".

As I progressed through puberty, I began to figure out what these things meant. I Wished I was a girl. It made sense to me then. But I kept it to myself. After all, I wasn't into boys and I didn't want to send that signal and it wasn't like I could DO anything about it. But did I ever wish... Birthday's, shooting stars, long tunnels with held breath... any excuse. I fantasised with friends about becoming genetic microbiologists and inventing clever new ways to cause mutations. He wanted wings. I wanted to change my Y to an X. Then came the video games. My created or selected characters, almost always the women and girls. Occasionally someone would ask why, and I'd trot out the party line ""If you're gonna stare at a characters ass all day... heh heh"" but inside, I knew the reason. It was a projection. A projection of what I wished I could be.

On more than one occasion I allowed my roleplayed woman characters to bleed out of the games. Pretending that there was, in fact, a woman on the other side, my side, of the monitor. More than once did that virtual relationship go beyond platonic. Only once was I discovered. The damage caused by the shattering of that illusion sours my ability to role play to this very day.

The years rolled on. I got married and had some kids, a career, friends... Yet none of them knows of the secret Me on the inside. How could they? This secret me is a person even I myself cannot accept. I admire trans/non-binary people. I admire their ability to accept and adopt their psychological gender in spite of the biological gender that was rolled for them. I admire the courage needed to publicly transition, and the strength to live with it. For I do not have these traits. How can I identify as a thing that I am not? I am not a woman. I've never been a woman. I have not, and can never fully experience life as a woman. And I hate myself for it.

I hate my male genitals.
I hate my male frame.
I hate the clothes I'm ""allowed"" to wear.

… No is ok. There are plenty of people that would pay to see me this way. Pfff …

To be honest I’m glad that she cope it relatively well. Even when all the questions are understandable, they are on the other hand very difficult to answer. Sometimes I have the feeling to be dissected like an experiment.

&gt; How many guys did you already had? 

*several.*

&gt; In our relationship? 

*no, before.*

&gt; Do you prefer one side more? 

*I prefer your side :) but somethimes I need the male world, the glamour, glitter, rainbows and unicorns.*

… and then there are questions I can not answer like:

&gt; How often do you want to “go out”? 

At the moment daily but I can not tell you in real life because it would break your heart so I say something like: 

*You tell me how often it is ok for you?* 
&gt; “Once every two weeks” 

and my stomach cringes.

&gt; Is it a phase? 

*It is some kind of a repeating phase.*

I’m 39 years old. Always been courious since 17. Grown up in the outback with financial problems my whole life. Some gays have committed suicide in my area becouse of bullying. I have no desire to hide anymore or to trick my fiancee. We are together since 1,5 years. I love her very much and love the sex we have. but I didn’t know until two months ago how much I miss this other life. I don’t like parking places and toilets, cheating on my fiance with guys that look like shit. This girl have some class. :) 

My fiancee has entrusted to a friend this topic, hoping to find some answers. A guy she's been once talking by e-mail and is actually in a relationship. He explained her that she must have understanding and that it is a part of me. bla bla bla aso... seemed pretty fine. 

The next day he has hit on her whether she would not like to have a real man. I could break this mother$%&amp;§ twice his nose. -.-

......................................................

So one week is over. We've been talking much I was once out ... on a monday. It was soooo boring because no one was in the two clubs where I've been. So I started to make [selfies](http://i.imgur.com/8Koi0Zu.jpg). ^ ^ It was one of the happiest days in my life. 

Before my coming out I was searching and storing transsexual porn. 
Now it's shoes and makeup.

My fiancee and I figured many points out. 

*I love my genitalia. No, I'm not gonna grow myself a pair of tits. ... not now :) Yes, I still want to marry you and I love you very much. I'm between two worlds and I feel great there* She understands that at the moment I want to live it out and go out more often. ... she made my eyebrows and bought my some cheap eyeshadow. :) ... clever girl... now she wants my expesive powder and lipliner. I only agreed if I can borrow her kimono. We have a deal.

Sometimes I have the feeling to be dissected like an experiment.\n\n&gt; How many guys did you already had? \n\n*several.*\n\n&gt; In our relationship? \n\n*no, before.*\n\n&gt; Do you prefer one side more? \n\n*I prefer your side :) but somethimes I need the male world, the glamour, glitter, rainbows and unicorns.*\n\n… and then there are questions I can not answer like:\n\n&gt; How often do you want to “go out”? \n\nAt the moment daily but I can not tell you in real life because it would break your heart so I say something like: \n\n*You tell me how often it is ok for you?* \n&gt; “Once every two weeks” \n\nand my stomach cringes.\n\n&gt; Is it a phase? \n\n*It is some kind of a repeating phase.*\n\nI’m 39 years old. Always been courious since 17. Grown up in the outback with financial problems my whole life. Some gays have committed suicide in my area becouse of bullying. I have no desire to hide anymore or to trick my fiancee. We are together since 1,5 years. I love her very much and love the sex we have. but I didn’t know until two months ago how much I miss this other life. I don’t like parking places and toilets, cheating on my fiance with guys that look like shit. This girl have some class. :) \n\nMy fiancee has entrusted to a friend this topic, hoping to find some answers. A guy she's been once talking by e-mail and is actually in a relationship. He explained her that she must have understanding and that it is a part of me. bla bla bla aso... seemed pretty fine. \n\nThe next day he has hit on her whether she would not like to have a real man. I could break this mother$%&amp;§ twice his nose. -.-\n\n......................................................\n\nSo one week is over. We've been talking much I was once out ... on a monday.

19,2015-02-08 07:27:15,2v6ae1,2,4,"[To start, I am very sorry for the incredibly long post-- there is a tl;dr at the bottom]

I am not sure if this is the right sub to post on,  but if it isn't some kind of redirection would be greatly appreciated.

Hi there, I am a straight cisfemale, and am dating a person who is biologically male and views himself (herself?) as a woman. We have been together for a little over a year now, and they recently told me about how they feel in that regard (though I had some suspicions about it before).  

Now I am pretty new to all of this and I want to be supportive, but I am a straight woman, and not physically attracted to women at all. Obviously the personality of a person is the most important thing in a relationship, but you can't discount someone's physical appearance. If my SO were to change his* appearance to look more feminine, I don't know how I would feel about that. I am very attracted to him* as he* is now, and I am not sure the feeling would stay if he* does decide to become more feminine.

I told them that they should see some kind of counselor for a number of reasons, however aside from it being expensive, a major excuse for not going is that they are feeling overwhelmed with work, school, and have no time for themselves (which is all the more reason to go to some kind of counselor. I know they are depressed, and I honestly am not qualified to give any kind of advice. Plus I'd rather they learn some kind of ""coping"" mechanism from said counselor).

As an aside, the more he* thinks about change, the more ""aggravated"" he* becomes (for lack of a better word). Though it might not be on purpose, he* has snapped at me before for little things (driving too cautiously, inviting him* on errands then getting upset that he accepted the invitation to do errands when he* has so little free time. Just a lot of little things that if they happened once every so often, it wouldn't matter, but they do build up over time, especially as the frequency increases). And when he* realizes what he's* done, he* apologizes and insists he* doesn't mean to be so hurtful. It's rough, because I feel like I go out of my way to do so many nice things for him*, and that is the response I get. It is shitty getting jerked around like that.

Our relationship is already a little rocky as it is, and though I do love him* it is becoming harder and harder for me to find reasons to stay together (especially due to the above). I really do try to be understanding and helpful and someone he* can lean on. But he* doesn't tell me why he* is upset, hell, he* hardly tells me why his* day at work was shitty. It is so hard to be caring if he* doesn't let me in. 

I know that if my SO does decide to go take the plunge and go through with being a transperson, unfortunately it is highly likely that they will be disowned by their family.

I don't want to be a factor in weather or not he* physically changes himself* . I want him* to be happy with who he* is (but if that does happen, I don't know if I can be with him* . I want him* to find someone who 100% loves and supports him* for who he, or she, is). My SO has told me that I am a large factor in decision making, and I don't want that to be the case. 

The way I see it is that my SO really has three options: 

1. Go to counseling and get many things mentally ironed out. 

1. Don't go through with anything (or don't even try) and be unhappy. 

1. Go through with it and possibly lose me. (I do want to be supportive of him/her, but I don't know if I could stay with someone I wasn't physically attracted to. I think they are a wonderful person, but honestly I don't know if I am strong enough to do it.)

**Started using he pronoun, as that is what he currently goes with. Plus they/their is hard to keep track of.
_______________

**TL;DR: It took my SO so long to come out to me because they didn't know how I'd act. and honestly I still don't really know what to think. I have told them that they should go to some sort of councilor to talk about how they are feeling (because like many people in the LGBTQ community, my SO is also depressed) and is accidentally taking out their aggravation on me.**

23,2015-02-10 04:12:20,2vds44,7,3,"Throwaway account here.  But this question has been on my mind for a few weeks now and I was hoping someone far more informed than I am could answer it.

I assume most people here are pretty against the idea of gender roles:  Men gotta be stone cold, emotionless car repairmen and women have to be more submissive, prettied-up sandwich makers.  These roles and assumptions about people based on their sex is harmful, wrong, and toxic for reasons obvious enough not to be explained in this text post.

Where this comes into play with transsexualism is my question.  If, for example, I was born male, but I love feeling pretty, find being submissive more suiting to my personality and am sexually attracted to other males, I may feel like I am a woman trapped in a man's body and may consider transitioning.

My question is:  Is this perpetuating gender roles?  Should we look at a flamboyant, submissive, gay male as someone who is a ""woman"" because those are ""women things""?  Are designating these traits as those of a specific gender encouraging the roles many of us despise?  Why can't we accept that a male may very well be submissive, pretty and attracted to males?  Is this a result of gender roles and transitioning that male into a women trying to get him to fit our binary criteria of how we see the sexes?

I truly hope this question does not offend anybody.  That was not at all my intention.

30,2015-02-12 16:18:51,2vnw27,0,6,"Hi r/trans! I'm doing my thesis for my master's in public health on gender nonbinary people's experiences in the health care system (because the medical/health system is super binary, and there is little to no research on how that affects nonbinary people), and I've got an online survey that needs responses! If you're someone who is not a man or a woman and you've ever wanted to rant or rave about your health care experiences, this is your time to shine! If you know some nonbinary people who might be interested, please share this with them!

IN PARTICULAR, given the responses I've gotten so far, I really really need responses from nonbinary people who are people of color and/or designated male at birth (DMAB).

The survey is an online, mostly open-ended/qualitative survey, so most of the questions allow you to type as much as you want. Think of it as an online, typed interview.

What do you get out of doing this? Primarily, the chance to ultimately share your experience in the healthcare system with healthcare providers, policymakers and researchers, and hopefully affect the way that they think about the gender binary in healthcare. Secondarily, you get my undying love for helping me finish my thesis. Also, you have the chance to enter a lottery to win one of 2 $50 giftcards to amazon.com (I really wish that I could pay everyone who took the survey, but unfortunately I don't have the funding for that).

Who can take the survey? Anyone who is 18 or over, a US resident, and identifies as somehow outside of the man/woman binary. Again, I particularly need respondents who are people of color and/or designated male at birth.

Here is the survey link, feel free to share it far and wide! https://yalesurvey.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_en58ujewB485VKB Thank you all so much!

37,2015-02-16 23:39:37,2w4s6c,3,2,"Hello, I am 19 years old probably MtF transgender. My problem lies in rather silly and maybe even unimportant detail, but it kinda eats my confidence away.

First of all, I am going to give you as short version of my story as possible, but it is still sensitive matter to me and I easily wander of the purpose to express my feelings, so I am sorry, if I start to ramble non sense.

Here we go:
I have now suffered 8 years of depression and I have finally suppressed it at least to levels where it only has minor effects to my daily basis life. I had multiple suicide attempts along the way, but as I loved my family way too much, I always pussied out of guaranteed plans, like jumping off building or shooting myself. I only took toxins and pills, but they didn't prove to be fatal in the amounts I took them and to my parents I just seemed sick.

I lived 6 years without anyone noticing my depression nor my suicidal behavior. Until once I had made a cocktail, which would certainly take me out, but then I end up crying in my mom's arms as I felt like that they deserved a chance to try to help me, since they also loved me. I couldn't speak to hear a word, but she understood somehow and there started my process towards salvation. 

In the beginning I couldn't even tell the therapist that I wasn't okay, but obviously we both knew that was a filthy lie and we kept meeting these awkward meetings for a month until I was able to crack my armor an tell her something. 

Through out the 2,5 years I have attended the therapy with multiple therapists unfortunately. I have opened up and I have gain clarity of my own actions and who I am. Those 8 years I had not lived as I wanted. I had taken this notion that I need to live for others and their set goals as mine were not important and non-achievable . I had been following same things same goals for 8 years, without once considering, if I liked these they were just things which made everyone around me happy and proud. This obviously was exhausting and it was probably reason why I run out of juice in 6 years.

Those 8 years I had suppressed my feeling completely and I had forgotten my dream, the cause of all this. It was on 5th grade when I realized that I would love to be girl. I judged it as a silly dream and I didn't give it much time to develop as I only seem to receive negative feedback from my peers and media around that time. Not that I directly ever approached anyone with my dream.
It also wasn't such a big deal since I never really pursuit my own dreams and more just went along others, as I was shy and emphatic and understanding.

I made a promise that, if my family died one day or everyone would disappear I would pursue it. There on forward I started to walk in the armor whose purpose was to make others happy. I somehow was able to erase the memory of that moment and my dream until I remembered last Christmas after really dark chapter in my healing process. It wasn't that the person was forgotten completely I still did things and actions which were more geared towards girls and enjoyed them and I felt a bit outcast among my male friends for no apparent reason, but I couldn't connect these to being girl or wanting to be a girl and I also heavily over expressed my manliness to suppress the real me, I guess, since I didn't really get anything out of it.

It took me almost an year to accept and come terms with it. Mostly since I didn't even have anyone to discuss it with, since my therapist had just switched. I have now talked with my therapist and we have good relationship now and we decided to apply to treatment as it works a bit weird in Finland.


The problem that I face now is that, since these 8 years have made my personality quite washed out to be honest, I feel like blank page, with few words on it. I do not really get this sensation that I am girl, but more like I want to be girl and with that comes notion that can I ever look or act like a girl, if I only want to be girl, but thinking my background would this be normal as I do not really know anything even about myself. All I know that my favorite color is teal and I love cooking.

Although there is alot ""proof"" of transgender-ism in my past, but I do not remember these moments in my head, so I do not know how I perceived myself back then. I used to like more ""girly colored"" cloths like red and light blue, majority of my friends use to be girls and I used to opt. to hang out with them. I had a surgery to my foreskin as it got infected, the only reason it would get infected is that if you do not wash or touch it, which could indicate that I was uncomfortable with my genitalia when I was little also, first time I touch myself was somewhere in 6th-7th grade. I also never really felt comfortable with my body was I fat or in shape what so ever.  This all was before I got depressed and wore my armor to hide everything even from me.

The thing is that all this creates anxiety over the fact that, if no one will believe me, if I can never act like girl or pass a girl even if I managed to obtain the looks. My family won't be taking me with open arms and I know that for fact.



So the question is that. What do you think of my situation and do you think I am or I could be transgender still, even if I do not really identify as a girl that much, especially around the peers around me since I feel like I can't throw away the act, but more want to be girl and be treated as a girl. 

I would appreciate all the feedback and thank you for reading this long story of mine. I thank you bottom of my heart. &lt;3.

A magazine made for girls, like it said something like ""for girls, by girls"". Sometimes I am tempted to buy such things. Also I love buying hygienic products, body lotion, hair products etc. I am probably one of the most hygienic persons in my area, I\'d almost call myself overhygienic.\n\n\n\nI want to be a handsome boy but also a cute girl. But none of those works for me, because I am chubby and I have bad selfconfidence and all. \n\n\n\nWhen I wear a dress I feel like a guy trying to look feminine.\n\n\n\nIt feels like I am a man, like I am born a man, in a female body, and I want to be both genders. I know I don\'t want my female body at all, but I do want to be girly and I do act very feminine at times. But I also really want to be this handsome guy, I especially imagine myself rapping hopelessly to asian rap songs on stage in front of many people. What even am I... I am so confused about myself. Is it normal to feel like I\'m born in the wrong body, that I am a guy, but want to be both?

If i felt like I am a shade of grey between genders - and that my ideal body is still fairly female but much harder and more muscular than average- bordering on masculine. 

Does this make me some degree of transgender? If I needed hormones or other medical therapy to achieve the body I think I should be in - does that suggest I am transgender? 

Looking forward to questions and opinions :)

22 y/o female here.

I've been questioning both my sexuality and gender identity for a while. I'd say I'm much more attracted to men, but not quite hetero. I don't think I'd actually date another woman though.

But I haven't dated in general since early high school due to PTSD and social anxiety that stems from it. Like I can't leave my house alone, and I haven't had ANY friends since I dropped out of school at 16. Absolutely no calls, text, visits, nothing, for like 5-6 years now. I stopped seeing my therapist (for anxiety) because of anxiety too.

So... it's unlikely I will spend my life with ANYBODY, let alone another lady I'd like. So I don't think it's necessary I tell my family I'm bi. But... should I, anyway? They are open-minded and liberal, so they'd accept it. But I don't want their opinion of me to change.

And about being genderqueer: do everyday cis people even really understand it? I don't even understand it within myself, but I know I'm non-binary. In my past relationships I felt like a woman, I liked the female role in the relationship and in sex. But I have dreams of being male.

Even male/male scenarios sometimes. It's like I have half a man's brain.

Since I was a teenager I've had hormone problems, it gives me facial hair and irregular cycles. Not sure if that is possibly influencing my brain chemistry, or if something messed up somewhere... Or if I've always been both... Docs couldn't find what was wrong.

So lately I've been in a sort of a pickle, some youtube peeps that I've watch for years ( Gigi gorgeous for example ) have came out as transgender. I know Gigi came out a while back &amp; her transition is going fabulously. but my problem is a question that made me wonder where my path was heading. The people that I adore to watch started off as slowly becoming more feminine. more androgynous. Everything about them just screamed girl each step forward. So, I felt as if I was heading down that same path.

What if I was transgender &amp; I just didn't know it or ignored it? Yes I've imagined being a girl &amp; if I was given the option at birth I would choose it. But I came to the conclusion that I don't think I am transgender, maybe 70% female. But not all there. I don't know what that's called or how to express that tho. All I know is I just feel  fine as how I am and being different is what I like. The thought that I might be something &amp; I just didn't know it scared me a lil. Because I fear wasting time being unhappy &amp; not fully satisfied.

So anyways, I asked myself, if don't want to transition &amp; I don't mind being a boy. Why am I still a little unhappy? I realized I just didn't like my masculine features, I don't have any chest or back hair ( I'm 18 btw ) &amp; the thought of growing hair there in a few years scares me. I was wondering if there is a way in HTR that can allow me to look &amp; feel a little more feminine? Softer skin, less hair, lil feminine  body adjustments. Is there a way to gain this without fully transitioning? Like a good balance? I don't want boobs &amp; very much like being androgynous.

I just want to feel less manly yah know? I just don't know where to start. Sorry for the whole back story. I really appreciate your time &amp; thank you!! &lt;3

A friend of mine in the local community is taking some pretty heavy flak for their work helping address some horrible misogynistic bullshit at a university the work at. They are being bashed in the media and worse over violently misgendered (they identify as a nonbinary transperson, and some transphobic assholes make that grounds for attack). This as left them obviously upset and dysphoric. 

I myself being a transgirl combat the dysphoria I feel by doing gender affirming things like wearing something pretty or doing my makeup really well, but this has raised the question for me so I thought I'd ask you folks: as a person who is nonbinary what do you do to help you cope? What kind of self-care do you employ to easy any dysphoric feelings?

Also I'd like to know for future use if there is anything I can do to better support nonbinary people and help be affirming to them? Obviously I use pronouns as requested, but I'd love to know any way I can support my NB community better. 

Thanks for reading!

I'm a long time lurker and decided to post for some advice.  
  
I'm currently dating an awesome girl, we get along really well and everything seems peachy!  
She is very open minded and intelligent, but has shown some signs that she is looking for a rather traditional relationship with a cis man. Which I am not.  
I'm comfortable with my male body, but I am rather androgynous and I sometimes feel feminine.  
She did say that she wouldn't like it if I wore girly clothes, but we only touched on these topics in a joking manner as of now.   
  
Do you have any ideas how I could go about telling her how I feel about my gender? if she is only embracing my male half, that would be a dealbreaker.  
So naturally, I don't want to shock her by bursting out with all these thoughts. Who knows, maybe she would be down to try something new to her. 
I bet some of you have more experience than me in explaining what genderqueer means, so help me out here!

5,2015-02-01 21:25:25,2ug2cl,4,11,"OK! ~~This won't be a long story~~, but I wanted somewhere to at least write this down. I'm in a super great mood, and I feel RIGHT for once. It's new for me, as I'm sure for a lot of us starting out.

Last night, after lying in bed restless for an hour, thinking about transness, I made that kind of decision where you never formed all the constituent parts in your brain beforehand, but you act quickly as though you know exactly what you want to do. I looked up ""gender therapy"" and found this helpful page of info and resources. (http://www.hemingways.org/GIDinfo/therapy.htm if anyone is looking for an international list of gender therapy providers)

I found a doctor fifteen minutes away! I thought I'd have to drive an hour and a half away. This bolstered my confidence a ton. And doing this simple research, and not being so afraid all the goddamn time, helped me formulate clear thoughts and ideas of what I wanted. I even suddenly remembered long-ago memories of wishing to god (and after I stopped believing at a very early age, the need for wishes still persisted - so I literally asked my ceiling every night haha). I remember wearing towels like a skirt, and how HAPPY I was. I didn't know I was imagining being a ""girl"" I never had a chance to conceptualize it. So, I internalized every nasty bit of rhetoric and idea behind queerness, and transness, and... went many many years of my life being utterly contemptuous of my surroundings.

ANYWAYS, a year ago I ""came out"" as trans, then kinda recoiled, then the feeling came back vengefully. This was last night. There isn't a shred of doubt anymore. So, I initiated the second such conversation with my mother this morning. She was absolutely accepting, asked to be in therapy with me (to which I said maybe... but I do want her there at some point) and asked about my sexuality, because I've only dated men. I'm ace, but she has no distinction between romance and sexual attraction - the latter which doesn't dictate my relationships. She has no idea what to expect in the next few years, and neither do I. She really wants me to be happy, and I could tell she was putting the pieces together in her head for the first time. The first time I told her about all this amid a breakdown, of course, and so she took me less seriously. When we were talking, it's like suddenly we had an answer to my behavior and periphery problems (depression, general anxiety, developing agoraphobia).

Ok, I think that's plenty off my chest. Thank you for reading and thanks to the community for facilitating this sort of sharing. Without it and spaces like it, I wouldn't have known any of this.

SO GRATEFUL to all the trans queens out there. You are my inspiration. You keep me alive. Stay fabulous and beautiful. SPECIAL THANKS to Laverne Cox what a wonderful wonderful human being.

2 months ago, I was fine being male and had no problem with it. I think girls are really pretty, most of the time when I see one I think that they look pretty/beautiful, this confused me because I thought I was gay. 

After looking at them, sometimes id think ""I wish I could be pretty"". This is what started my questioning, when I think about my confusion, my heart beats faster and sometimes I feel a stomach ache. 

tbh I don't think I want to be a girl, it does seem appealing at times, and the masculine parts of me don't bother me (I think), I have hair on my body and it doesn't bother me really it just sometimes looks... odd

I think I'm fine with how my body is, even tho I have some extra weight. I don't really like facial hair tho, well only the prickliness after shaving is what bothers me. With my clothes, I wear t shirt and jeans all the time, but they do sometimes feel uncomfortable I get used to it eventually. I think I'm fine with my penis, I'm a but conscious about the size and it can feel uncomfortable and annoying at times. I get embarrassed when someone points out something like ""you have a moustache""  

I'm not like most guys in terms of how I act and what I do, I'm not a typical ""bro"" and I'm a little flamboyant. I'm terms of personality, I'm definitely in the middle of masculine and feminine. 

Even tho I feel this way, I still feel as if something's wrong, I have no idea what. Any help is really appreciated

Hi, I'm DMAB, just turned 18 last month. I've had depression and anxiety for about 6ish years (idk might as well throw that in if it's important). Also please forgive me if I use some terms or say things wrong because I am new to all of this. For the last few months I've felt really... off? I realized a bit before reading/watching an anime/manga Hourou Musuko (which I really recommend) and reading/watching it helped me sort of figure out that most of the time (70%?) I feel ""male"", 10% I feel somewhere in the middle (but very confused), and then the other 20% definitely more ""female"". But I don't know if the ""male"" is just how I usually feel, not necessarily ""male"".

I'm just confused.

I am not necessarily upset with my current body, but I'm pretty hairy and have a strong jawline, so that's kind of ehh. I don't mind my genitals or whatnot. But sometimes I wish I could wear cute clothes (I'm really jealous of the options girls have for clothes), and I wish I could present as female and be female sometimes. I don't know.

I understand that I can be one or the other or both or neither. And I know I don't have to have a definitive answer to it.

I've only come out to two people (both of whom I only met like two weeks ago but they are both really cool and one is non-binary, so that help with making me feel more comfortable with telling them).

I feel like... how I currently am, presenting as male, I'm just okay with it. There are times when I know I would feel better as a girl and want to be a girl, but almost never I'm like ""YEAH LETS BE A DUDE"". I'm just okay with being born ""male"".

Given that one of the functions of this sub is to create a support network for each other, how do you feel about requesting and offering art support?

I can't be the only person who is sometimes better at giving support through my drawings than through my words. An example of this is when my pal Sixthsomatic was going through a rough time recently and needed some positive art in her life, so I drew [this](http://i.imgur.com/23vgEZM.jpg) for her (posted with permission). Obviously it's not perfect (the hands are atrocious, haha) and I'm no pro artist, but she liked it and that's what matters.

So what do you think? Are you interested in making art for or receiving art from other folks on r/genderqueer as a part of our support network? Also, would any of you like to be drawn? I can't promise brilliance or a short timeline, but I'm getting back into art and would love to dedicate some time to drawing the wonderful folks in my community.

EDIT: Looks like there's some interest! As I've said to a couple folks in this thread, if you want to be drawn, just let me know which picture(s) I should use as reference, and what kind of style/clothing you prefer. PM me if you would rather not share that info here. We are a diverse community and I would love to draw all of you!

34,2015-02-05 23:00:13,2ux8km,0,1,"Wagwan friends, I hope this is allowed here. Over the past couple of months I've been combing the web for studies, sources and articles on LGBT+ phenomena for a new reddit project, but I need your help!

My project is focused on education and information, it will be a sub which focuses on the study of LGBT+ phenomena on a scientific level, broken down into the relevant categories, and hopefully if all goes to plan, it will grow to become the single best one-stop-shop for LGBT+ education and information in the world. 


I believe every person, LGBT+ or otherwise, deserves access to quality, unbiased information on LGBT+ phenomena and things like HIV from an LGBT+ perspective. I believe governments and schools around the world are drastically failing the people with this and much more can be done. I believe until people have a real education and understanding of LGBT+ phenomena, true equality will always be a pipe dream. I believe this is the next step for LGBT+ people and is massively over due.


I believe knowledge is power and I believe in empowerment through education. I believe the studies and sources scattered around the internet need to be collectivised into a one-stop-shop to provide a coherent consensus and curriculum for LGBT+ or non-LGBT+ persons to access and gain the education denied to them in schools, libraries and elsewhere. I believe the format of reddit subreddits are perfectly suited for collectivising and organising the material. 

I am asking everyone in the community to come together and share any studies, sources, articles and any other resources you can think of which have helped you personally, elevated your understanding in some way or otherwise stuck in your mind. 


I'm sure you'll agree awareness and understanding in the general public isn't as good as it could be, so I need your help to provide the best studies, sources, articles and other resources on non-binary, gender queer and gender fluidity for my project! 


I'm hoping everyone can come together and chip in their piece, and together we can build the biggest and best database of LGBT+ information in the world! Which everyone can benefit from and enjoy. 


 In doing so I want to provide a trapdoor for those who live in repressive regimes in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Russia, South America  and elsewhere to get access to the quality education and information they are entitled to and deserve. 

I doing so I want to deliver the smoking gun to myths, ignorance and prejudice in the form of an easily accessible database of facts and legitimate studies and sources which can be used in debate to prove or disprove something outright. I want this to be a community project which belongs to the community. The sub is for the whole world, everyone is a share holder.


The sub will be dedicated to strict quality control. I want it to have a reputation for being unbiased, no-nonsense, politically neutral and trust worthy when it comes to accessing quality, valid studies, sources and articles from legitimate bodies and websites. 

Subsequently, I am also looking for expert users to mod this sub; people who study genetics, biology, neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and similar relevant fields. 


I am looking for homosexual, bisexual, transgender, gender queer, asexual and intersex users who are experts in their chosen field in order to ensure strict quality control and have one or two of each mod the sub respectively, and I need the mods to have the expertise to be able to comb through everything we have collected and flag the dodgy or outdated material to ensure strict quality control. 

You don't need to be an expert or student of such STEM fields; people who are learned in psychology, sociology, psychiatry and counselling as well as political activism are also needed. Sexual health experts are also wanted. If you think you know your stuff about anything like this please don't hesitate to apply. Students are welcome, you don't need to be fully qualified. 

I simply do not have the expertise or the qualifications to ensure quality control myself, and I know there are a few users here who know their stuff about such things. I really hope they come forward and volunteer to mod my new project because without expert users to ensure quality material my sub simply won't work. If you would like to mod, please PM me or email with a few paragraphs about yourself and I will contact you once the sub is up and running. 


I want everything. Give me everything. Don't worry if you're not sure if it's trust worthy or legitimate because we can sort that out later. Just give me everything, please! 

You can share them here or if you can email them to me at LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com 

Please tell your friends and get their suggestions also! 

Please note; my laptop is still busted until the end of the month, so I am allowing a period of one month or so for users to submit material before I start to build the sub. 


Once the sub is up and running and the mods chosen, the mods will then comb through the material and remove anything that isn't sufficiently valid. 


Once mods have cross referenced and the material archived into the relevant category, the sub will then be open to the public to read and share. Once the basic foundation has been laid, the sub will then be dedicated to hosting new studies or sources as they are released. I want it to be *the* go to place to find the latest developments in study of all LGBT+ phenomena. 


My vision is a digital library of quality, informative and interesting material people can browse through for hours on end. My vision is a one stop shop for a quality education on LGBT+ phenomena which will undercut repressive regimes and transform the quality of LGBT+ debate online. My vision is whenever someone comes out, the first thing people think of is ""you have to check out this sub!"". 

My vision is a sub which catapults education and understanding of LGBT* phenomena and lasts, hosting new studies and sources as they are released. Please help me make my vision a reality. I can't do it without your help! 


There will also be a section for asylum seekers and kids sent to conversion camps or conversion therapy and other similar things. Like I said everyone is a share holder and this is a community project and everyone's input is welcome and needed 


Oh and I also need names for the sub. Please suggest names! Any other suggestions for how the sub will work and what it could be about are also very welcome. 

Please note I will also cross post this to other LGBT subs. 

email: LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com

Over the past couple of months I\'ve been combing the web for studies, sources and articles on LGBT+ phenomena for a new reddit project, but I need your help!\n\nMy project is focused on education and information, it will be a sub which focuses on the study of LGBT+ phenomena on a scientific level, broken down into the relevant categories, and hopefully if all goes to plan, it will grow to become the single best one-stop-shop for LGBT+ education and information in the world. \n\n\nI believe every person, LGBT+ or otherwise, deserves access to quality, unbiased information on LGBT+ phenomena and things like HIV from an LGBT+ perspective. I believe governments and schools around the world are drastically failing the people with this and much more can be done. I believe until people have a real education and understanding of LGBT+ phenomena, true equality will always be a pipe dream. I believe this is the next step for LGBT+ people and is massively over due.\n\n\nI believe knowledge is power and I believe in empowerment through education. I believe the studies and sources scattered around the internet need to be collectivised into a one-stop-shop to provide a coherent consensus and curriculum for LGBT+ or non-LGBT+ persons to access and gain the education denied to them in schools, libraries and elsewhere. I believe the format of reddit subreddits are perfectly suited for collectivising and organising the material. \n\nI am asking everyone in the community to come together and share any studies, sources, articles and any other resources you can think of which have helped you personally, elevated your understanding in some way or otherwise stuck in your mind. \n\n\nI\'m sure you\'ll agree awareness and understanding in the general public isn\'t as good as it could be, so I need your help to provide the best studies, sources, articles and other resources on non-binary, gender queer and gender fluidity for my project! \n\n\nI\'m hoping everyone can come together and chip in their piece, and together we can build the biggest and best database of LGBT+ information in the world! Which everyone can benefit from and enjoy. \n\n\n In doing so I want to provide a trapdoor for those who live in repressive regimes in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Russia, South America  and elsewhere to get access to the quality education and information they are entitled to and deserve. \n\nI doing so I want to deliver the smoking gun to myths, ignorance and prejudice in the form of an easily accessible database of facts and legitimate studies and sources which can be used in debate to prove or disprove something outright. I want this to be a community project which belongs to the community. The sub is for the whole world, everyone is a share holder.\n\n\nThe sub will be dedicated to strict quality control. I want it to have a reputation for being unbiased, no-nonsense, politically neutral and trust worthy when it comes to accessing quality, valid studies, sources and articles from legitimate bodies and websites. \n\nSubsequently, I am also looking for expert users to mod this sub; people who study genetics, biology, neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, and similar relevant fields. \n\n\nI am looking for homosexual, bisexual, transgender, gender queer, asexual and intersex users who are experts in their chosen field in order to ensure strict quality control and have one or two of each mod the sub respectively, and I need the mods to have the expertise to be able to comb through everything we have collected and flag the dodgy or outdated material to ensure strict quality control. \n\nYou don\'t need to be an expert or student of such STEM fields; people who are learned in psychology, sociology, psychiatry and counselling as well as political activism are also needed. Sexual health experts are also wanted. If you think you know your stuff about anything like this please don\'t hesitate to apply. Students are welcome, you don\'t need to be fully qualified. \n\nI simply do not have the expertise or the qualifications to ensure quality control myself, and I know there are a few users here who know their stuff about such things. I really hope they come forward and volunteer to mod my new project because without expert users to ensure quality material my sub simply won\'t work. If you would like to mod, please PM me or email with a few paragraphs about yourself and I will contact you once the sub is up and running. \n\n\nI want everything. Give me everything. Don\'t worry if you\'re not sure if it\'s trust worthy or legitimate because we can sort that out later. Just give me everything, please! \n\nYou can share them here or if you can email them to me at LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com \n\nPlease tell your friends and get their suggestions also! \n\nPlease note; my laptop is still busted until the end of the month, so I am allowing a period of one month or so for users to submit material before I start to build the sub. \n\n\nOnce the sub is up and running and the mods chosen, the mods will then comb through the material and remove anything that isn\'t sufficiently valid. \n\n\nOnce mods have cross referenced and the material archived into the relevant category, the sub will then be open to the public to read and share. Once the basic foundation has been laid, the sub will then be dedicated to hosting new studies or sources as they are released. I want it to be *the* go to place to find the latest developments in study of all LGBT+ phenomena. \n\n\nMy vision is a digital library of quality, informative and interesting material people can browse through for hours on end. My vision is a one stop shop for a quality education on LGBT+ phenomena which will undercut repressive regimes and transform the quality of LGBT+ debate online. My vision is whenever someone comes out, the first thing people think of is ""you have to check out this sub!"". \n\nMy vision is a sub which catapults education and understanding of LGBT* phenomena and lasts, hosting new studies and sources as they are released. Please help me make my vision a reality. I can\'t do it without your help! \n\n\nThere will also be a section for asylum seekers and kids sent to conversion camps or conversion therapy and other similar things. Like I said everyone is a share holder and this is a community project and everyone\'s input is welcome and needed \n\n\nOh and I also need names for the sub. Please suggest names! Any other suggestions for how the sub will work and what it could be about are also very welcome. \n\nPlease note I will also cross post this to other LGBT subs. \n\nemail: LGBTeducationproject@outlook.com   \n\nYou have the rest of February to submit material here or via email and apply for modship before we begin.

ANYWAYS, I have been dating my girlfriend for around two years now and we plan on staying together for the long run. Quite recently she (whom from this point on I will use gender neutral pronouns with) has come out as non-binary. They don't identify as a man, but just don't fully identify as a woman either. I completely support their decision, but I certainly was surprised on hearing about this. This doesn't affect how we feel about each other, at least I don't think so, it's just something I wasn't completely prepared for.

The way they describe it, they identify mostly with feminine traits, but also feel partly androgynous (no gender, although I'm not sure exactly what that means). They are also considering about potentially getting a chest binder for days where they feel androgynous. I am a cisgender male who until very recently was not aware of gender issues outside of being male and identifying as a woman or vice versa, so this mix of somewhere in the middle is all really new to me. They are straight and have no attachment to women, it's just the gender issue.

I searched this subreddit (and others) for a similar situation and drew a total blank. I'm wondering if anyone has had (or knows about) a similar experience and can share their story. I love my girlfriend very much and this doesn't change the fact, I just don't know exactly how to go about dealing with this change.

tl;dr: Girlfriend recently came out as non-binary, part feminine part androgynous (no gender). How do I deal with this change and most importantly accommodate them to make sure they feel comfortable at all times around me?

53,2015-02-09 00:25:01,2v8vpk,5,9,"Hello all! 

Recently I've been thinking about the term genderqueer, and whether it could apply to me (now or in the future). 

Basically, I experience the tension of not really believing that anyone is ""male,"" ""female,"" or ""straight."" I recently attended a men's group and had a horrifying experience, as their entire structure of masculinity was based on their theory of complementarity with their idea of women. I won't go into detail, but it was bad. 

I know that's not all masculinity can be, but I'm not sure how I'd define it at all. Or femininity for that matter. 

At the same time, I have certainly internalized my masculine status and am aware of it every day. In particular, my internalized misogyny sometimes comes out when I am frustrated (usually with objects when I am alone). So I know that there is a lot of ""guy shit"" inside me, which is set up as opposed to the sense of femininity I have internalized. 

There's a lot more to say, but I don't want to go on and on. 

TL;DR does anyone else feel a tension between knowing they've internalized their assigned gender while intellectually and emotionally yearning to escape its confines? 

As an addendum, I have a hard time thinking of masculinity as anything but negative.

So I came out as transgender to my conservative yet very open-minded cis GF last week.  We talked about it and decided that we both want to stay together because we love each other.

Basically I'm wondering if this for me is similar to the the ""buy [bi] now gay later"" adage in aspect to gender.  It's very hard for me to not think of it in that way.  She wants to know now upfront whether I see myself as m2f because that's a different set of goalposts which will be more difficult for her (accepting a public life as a lesbian couple with children)

The big thing is that she is interested in having a family and while I am as well, it's not the same burning feeling in me as it is in her.  I cannot decide if she is convincing me that I'm not fully m2f because that way it's easier to stay together or not.  It's kind of nervewracking.  We have both acknowledged that at this point (5 months HRT 0.5 weeks being out) it's difficult to know.

Truth is I have no idea what I am at this point either really.  All I know is that I wanted to start medical transition so I did and I feel a lot better.

Can anyone share a short story if they have had a similar experience?  I know nobody can get inside of my head in real life or in redditspace, but I thought I'd share anyway.

SECOND OF ALL she is still in the process of picking a pronoun she feels comfortable with, so in this post I will try to just use the neutral “they” “them” etc.

My SO of 1 ½ years came out as genderqueer to me almost exactly one month ago. Due to a home life and past relationships that tried (and still try) to force them into a classic female role, they have never felt secure enough to really own and explore their own identity, I am the first (and so far the only) one they have come out to in person.

They explained to me that they never felt strictly “female” even from when they were a child, but rather changed from “male” to “female to “neither” at different times (unknown for how long or how often). There wasn’t really much else they could explain, besides the assurance that they said that they were attracted to me sexually, and that they didn’t mind my attraction to their female form.
I am a cisgender male who is new to the concept of non-binary genders, but I have no problem with it and I told them so.

Since then, our relationship has continued to develop. We laugh, talk, and get along just fine, I love them very much and we are hoping to make this last a lifetime.

However, how we interact physically has drastically changed since they came out to me. Before, we were taking it very slow, but steadily moved forward. I knew that in past relationships they had been sexually manipulated (possibly abused, I have not pressed the subject) so I wanted to make sure they were going at a pace they felt comfortable at, even at this point we had never had sex.
 But since they came out to me, we seem to be going backwards. Physical touch is rare, and barely beyond the platonic (holding hands, limbs brushing together occasionally). Intimacy is nearly non-existent, as they seem to be developing repulsion to it. The few times we have been intimate, they would show signs of discomfort – sometimes even pain, but never mention it, leaving me feeling stressed and worried that I’m hurting them and draining any joy we used to get out of intimacy.

Attempts to talk about it are quickly shot down or the subject changed.

I am confused and hurt by this, I don’t know what’s going on, but first and foremost I want to support them as they explore their identity. Can anyone clue me into what they may be experiencing? Are we dealing with physical dysphoria? Can they be developing different sexual preferences? What can I do to better understand and support them?

71,2015-02-11 17:44:23,2vk1gc,5,4,"I (26GQ) been trying to figure out how to come out to my husband (26M) in a way that will minimize hurt feelings all around, and I am drawing a blank. I guess I just need to vent and get this off my chest more than anything.

I'm afab and genderqueer with a bit of fluidity in my presentation. I feel like my identity is more or less stable--not a woman, not a man, maybe leaning slightly feminine--but how I like to appear to other people fluctuates. I definitely have some days where I want to be as androgynous as possible, other days I want to wear all the makeup and try on all the dresses, and days where I am miserable that my body won't let me appear as masculine as I want to be.

When I met my now-husband at 19, I'd put myself in the female box by default (despite never really feeling like a woman at all), so female is how he's always perceived me. But two years ago, I started exploring the whole nonbinary business on my own, and started finally figuring myself out. I've slowly started experimenting with new things, finding out what I like and don't like.

Experimenting with my appearance has gone well so far--he's not precisely supportive, but he hasn't objected to me binding or cutting my hair. He's been less cooperative about word choice. I'm not picky about pronouns, but I dislike being described as ""womanly,"" ""feminine,"" or anything of the sort. Several times I've told him that these sorts of words make me feel uncomfortable, and his response has been a hurt ""but I love you and I love the way your body is shaped,"" or ""but there's nothing wrong with being feminine--are you sure you aren't being misogynistic?"" Then he'll stop using those descriptors for a few weeks before they seep back in and we have to have the whole conversation over again--it's infuriating.

I don't think he's deliberately trying to make me feel uncomfortable or invalidated, but rather that he thinks that there's nothing wrong with being a woman, therefore I should feel fine being described as one, like it's some kind of internalized misogyny thing that I have to get over. It's like he can't grasp the idea that being a woman is fine, but I am not one, even if I have breasts. I think he expects me to change my definition of ""woman"" rather than he change his definition of me.

To add to the pile of things to talk about, I am becoming more and more certain that I want to start a low dose of T and get a breast reduction to make my body more androgynous, and I know that if I were single, I would probably have started T months ago. I have an exaggeratedly feminine body--30G breasts, hourglass waist, huge child-bearing hips--the whole bit. While I haven't brought up the topic of HRT with my husband, I have been progressively more vocal about my dislike of my breasts; the response is always something to the tune of ""your breasts are a beautiful part of you and I love them."" Sigh.

It's becoming more clear to me as I write this that he perceives my whole gender-questioning process as a phase that I'll outgrow, like I'm some kind of flighty child. Or at least that he's forcing himself to believe that, because the alternative is that it isn't a phase, and that I'm not the same as the image of me he's crystallized in his mind, and that I might want to behave outside of the role he's imagined me into, or modify my body in ways that detract even the tiniest bit from its perceived perfection (he was also quite opposed to me getting a second set of ear piercings, for fuckssake). If I push too hard, he'll rail on how I disregard his feelings and don't care about the relationship, but if I don't push hard enough, he'll never accept that I'm a -person- who has my own desires and values that don't necessarily align with his. Agh, I just don't know what to do about this.

He is literally the only one that I really want to understand and accept this. I don't need everyone to call me by a new name or new pronouns, I don't care if my coworkers think I'm male or female, I don't care if my parents wonder why my voice is deeper. I do care that my husband stops seeing me as something I'm not, and comes to terms with who I am, and hopefully continues to love the person I am even if my body isn't as close to his ideal.

I've got an online survey that needs responses, and if you ID as anywhere outside of the gender binary and you've ever wanted to rant or rave about your health care experiences, this is your time to shine!

IN PARTICULAR, given the responses I've gotten so far, I really need responses from nonbinary people who are:
-people of color
-designated male at birth (DMAB)
-over age 25

The survey is an online, mostly open-ended/qualitative survey, so most of the questions allow you to type as much as you want. Think of it as an online, typed interview.

What do you get out of doing this? Primarily, the chance to ultimately share your experience in the healthcare system with healthcare providers, policymakers and researchers, and hopefully affect the way that they think about the gender binary in healthcare. Secondarily, you get my undying love for helping me finish my thesis. Also, you have the chance to enter a lottery to win one of 2 $50 giftcards to amazon.com (I really wish that I could pay everyone who took the survey, but unfortunately I don't have the funding for that).

Who can take the survey? Anyone who is 18 or over, a US resident, and identifies as somehow outside of the man/woman binary. Again, I particularly need respondents who are people of color and/or designated male at birth and/or over age 25.

Live at home with my parents and am pretty much a failure - but hope to graduate from college this May.

I've pretty much IDed as ace since I had an ID (2007 or 2008), and then when I actually had a bit of a sex drive I got confused about that. I'm still super confused about that, so that's fun. Interest waxes and wanes in getting off. I dated one guy once in 2009. I'm not really sure why but I did the flustery fluttery thing and there was never real sex 'cause I was young and insecure and not ready and such. A few years after that I realized I was probably arom as well (and started questioning whether I was realy ace). 

During late 2013 and 2014 I explore my sexuality - not who I'm interested in, just stopping repressing it horrifically. Find out I do like vaginal penetration, amongst other things. Some kinky exploration - but still too scared to do that with people. End up masturbating for/with friends online once or twice. Only because flustered about friend. Not sure what feelings are. Flustered confusion about two friends continue to date. Every couple of weeks grumbled demands for living together and threesome orgies. Not sure if joke or serious. Probably would bury face and hide if actually confronted about this. Do bury face and hide when friends tease, including friends other than those two. Easy to fluster. 

Late December 2014 to early January 2015, I figured that maybe I was more accurately demiromantic and demisexual and for about an evening that satisfied me - uuuuntil I just realized ""wait FUCK THAT'S STILL NOT ANSWERING THE WHO, JUST THE WHEN"". So I started calling myself a demisquared because lol, two demis, and gave up on figuring out romantic/sexual orientation (again). 

Fast forward to February 2015: I start wondering if I'm even comfortable considering myself female. Do I even have a gender? I stop using gendered pronouns if I can help it. It's odd, but kinda nice to avoid it, I guess. Doesn't solve issues, but doesn't cause more. Got my hair cut to do spiky short hairs, but don't bother putting product in it, and ended up loving the androgynous look it gave me after a little growing in (it was Beiber-y at first). 

I've always been fairly tomboyish and not overly feminine - and I know that's not part of gender identity since gender roles, etc. - but I've never been particularly taken with boobs, since they're inconvenient (take them please), and I've always wondered what it would be like to have a dick. I'm not really dysphoric other than not liking boobs 'cause they're inconvenient as hell, and kinda wanting a dick 'cause convenience. I don't like... hate myself for what my body is. I don't hate having a vagina (though I hate the word). 

On a whim and because it was pretty (we will not discuss why I am not going to make myself look even crazier at first post) I bought a packer. I do enjoy having it. Not entirely sure if I'll ever be comfortable wearing it outside my room. It is pretty and comforting though. 

I don't exactly know if I have a gender. I don't know if it changes day to day. I don't know how I feel about aforementioned two friends: I get all fluttery and confused if I think about it too long. Not sure if possessive-platonic-would-not-mind-sex or there's something more or what. Aforementioned friends are female. Do not think this matters?

I'm not trying to belittle those who really do struggle with this on a psychological level, on a day to day basis. I'm also not trying to be something I'm not. I have recently considered the prospect that I'm not just cis female. Before, I really didn't pay attention to it with the exception of one year in my adolescence when my mother tried to ""push"" me to be a ""girl"". I realized that I didn't fall into male or female so easily. I'm also a person who doesn't really care what people identify as their sexuality and gender. I'm more concerned with whether you open doors for elderly or think Big Bang Theory is the pinnacle of good television and I generally don't favor labels of any kind. However, it has really thrown me off that there may be something there that I identify better with. The things that have me thinking: I'm lucky to have been raised, for the most part, in a household that allowed me to be what I wanted, sometimes unintentionally. My parents understood early on that I liked bikes more than barbies and buying me dresses and Mary Janes were a waste of money. But I still liked the barbies and mary janes sometimes you know? I never felt that I was truly a tomboy because I never thought of myself as a girl when I was with the boys, if that makes sense. My taste would fluctuate every few months. Sometimes I was really into what's considered feminine or ""girl stuff"" and other times masculine or ""boy stuff"". This may have been partly due to my parents being divorced, so spending time with my dad meant WWE(back when it was much more popular), fishing, sports. I got to be louder and rougher. Spending time with mom meant I got to paint my nails and get pretty hairstyles every week, I did not have to worry about fighting my brothers and could strut around in my dress. Still, I liked that option of being one of the guys one day and a princess the second. My parents thought I was a tomboy, and thought my middle school years were a phase. But by high school I continued with the fluctuations. Dressed and spoke like a guy one day, was in a skirt doing hair the next. Really, everything started to meld together. I would dress like a guy buy still be feminine, dress like a girl but still be masculine. Sometimes people couldn't(still can't sometimes) tell if I was a male or female. I'm still like that and it's not deliberate, so to speak. There is no conscious choice to ""act"" like a guy when I get up in the morning it's about how I feel. I'm not acting.

However, it has really thrown me off that there may be something there that I identify better with. The things that have me thinking: I\'m lucky to have been raised, for the most part, in a household that allowed me to be what I wanted, sometimes unintentionally. My parents understood early on that I liked bikes more than barbies and buying me dresses and Mary Janes were a waste of money. But I still liked the barbies and mary janes sometimes you know? I never felt that I was truly a tomboy because I never thought of myself as a girl when I was with the boys, if that makes sense. My taste would fluctuate every few months. Sometimes I was really into what\'s considered feminine or ""girl stuff"" and other times masculine or ""boy stuff"". This may have been partly due to my parents being divorced, so spending time with my dad meant WWE(back when it was much more popular), fishing, sports. I got to be louder and rougher. Spending time with mom meant I got to paint my nails and get pretty hairstyles every week, I did not have to worry about fighting my brothers and could strut around in my dress. Still, I liked that option of being one of the guys one day and a princess the second. My parents thought I was a tomboy, and thought my middle school years were a phase. But by high school I continued with the fluctuations. Dressed and spoke like a guy one day, was in a skirt doing hair the next. Really, everything started to meld together. I would dress like a guy buy still be feminine, dress like a girl but still be masculine. Sometimes people couldn\'t(still can\'t sometimes) tell if I was a male or female. I\'m still like that and it\'s not deliberate, so to speak. There is no conscious choice to ""act"" like a guy when I get up in the morning it\'s about how I feel. I\'m not acting. I don\'t think I\'m trans sexual because I don\'t want to be a male all the time. I really don\'t truly identify as one. I also don\'t truly identify as female either.

Trying to figure this out...feel like I am getting closer to some answers but the more I dig the more complicated things seem to get. 

I struggle a lot with internal identity. *A lot*.

I feel like the interface through which I process the world, the internal observer, doesnt have a gender. It's just me. I always thought I was male because of the parts, and I didnt believe that my desire to be a girl was any more than fetish. Now that I accept it's much more, I fear that I am not a girl. That I am really male. 

Why does this bother me? I dont know. I just know I dont want it. I feel like there is something truly female about my *flow*, and it's the way I want to lock in to this world and relationships with others. If I had the choice, I would have been born cis female.

But the identity feels like it comes and goes. When it's on I feel feminine and care free and happy. I love it, it's where I truly feel whole and like everything has meaning. When it's gone is when I feel like I am just a delusional male.

Cut to last night, where on valentines day I put on stockings for my girlfriend (I like being and feeling pretty). But my mood changes and suddenly the observer inside is telling me that I am pathetic, a sad ugly man trying to be a girl. 

These states are hard to deal with. In them there is no solution. I do not want to be a male in these states, I dont get relief by letting myself lapse into a male identity. My feminine voice begins to feel fake, and the observer tells me I am a fraud. My voice goes back to what is comfortable (doesnt require effort) and then I experience dysphoria from using the male voice.

In some ways, ways I dont understand, I feel like I am non-binary. Like Alyssa sits right on the outside of the female boundary, almost there but not. Sadly looking in on the inside and feeling like if she had been born inside that binary, these doubts wouldnt be here.

I am working with a therapist and hoping I can find peace. I am on hormones now for 4 months, and I like estrogen. I like that my body is becoming more feminine, and I like when I can feel emotion and sometimes I feel like a real girl and it makes me so happy.

What does this sound like? A trans identity and struggle aggravated by anxiety/depression swings, or a non-binary identity I am trying to run from? Or does it just sound like the mental struggle of being transgender?

However I don't think it is possible to be BORN as both genders.

I believe the people who say they are genderfluid are actually simply transgender. NOBODY wants to be transgender. Saying you are genderfluid is empowering and can make a transgender person feel better and more in control. Also being genderfluid is ""fun"" for some.

The people that have problems with their bodies and yet say they are gender fluid? I think they are just transgender in denial.

In order to be BORN as both genders, you would need two brains for that, which isn't possible.

There is no evidence of such a thing.

Lack of evidence doesn't mean proof of existence.

Otherwise, ""otherkin"" (like mentioned below) and any other idea would be considered real no matter what, because there is nothing that disproves it.

The brain develops with a set sex of male or female in the womb. The brains of males and females are physically different. This is an undeniable fact.

For ""genderfluid"" to be real, brain would need to go through a constant biological metamorphosis between male and female during the entire life of a person. This can not (and would not) happen once the brain has developed. Otherwise transgender people, MTF and FTM, would NOT exist. The basis of transgender concept is that gender can not be changed no matter what once the brain developed in the womb.

For ""non-binary"" to be real, there would need to exist another sex hormone that isn't estrogen nor testosterone. Emphasis in ""sex hormone"" medical term. This 3rd sexual hormone does not exist.

There is no 3rd sex hormone and its impossible for brain to constantly metamorphose once developed. Ergo, 1 brain sex that doesn't change.

The brain sex can only be physically male or female (there are no other choice outside of the estrogen and testosterone).

There is no 3rd option, not even for intersex people. Not even for transpeople. The sex hormones do not create a ""brain that constantly changes physically"" in neither case.

There is no precedent, evidence, antecedent of anything like a 3rd brain that is not male or female. (And no, an internet blog with the ""experiences"" of a teenager doesn't count).

Detractors may be skeptical, it may sound mean, it may make some internet blogs angry, but its a fact and shouldn't be hidden. That would only spread misinformation.

There is no fact or study that proves ""non-binary brain"" or ""genderfluid brain"" are real, its just suppositions and speculation.

Science has proven differences between male and female brain, but not the existence of other kind of brains.

About 4-5 months ago I started questioning my gender, and every passing day seems to make everything that comes with being assigned female more uncomfortable and stressful for me, not because I am ashamed with it or uncomfortable with my body but because I'm beginning to realize how drastically my biological sex affects my life and how I can't control that. It's fucking scary. I'm a confident person with skyscraper levels of self-esteem, and I have never had anything negative except stress/discomfort with being perceived as female come with my gender. But right now I'm so agitated with the assumptions that my head hurts. Why do people think they know what I like, who I'm attracted to, what I want to wear, or what I want to be called? Because they think they know what genitals I have? It doesn't make sense! How did we start this? What's the logic there? 

So, like most any nonbinary or trans person, I've had my fair share of mean people, bigots, or just people who are unaware that gender isn't two boxes. I thought I had brushed all those experiences off, as I've almost always been able to be myself regardless; now they're all replaying in my head. That I'm perceived as female isn't necessarily what's driving me crazy. It's the notion that my sexual organs really have such an impact on how I'm treated, the choices I make and the choices I'm allowed to make, where I go, what I do, the social situations I'm placed into and how I am expected to act in them, and the fact that if I simply reject all of this like I'd like to, I won't be taken seriously and/or the assumptions would still be there. I'm scared that I won't be able to deal with them anymore. I've gotten pretty good at it, but I don't know if I'll be able to handle much more. For example, I have a haircut tomorrow. My mother is going to take me to a women's hair salon, basically throw my biological sex in the hairdresser's face with my assigned name and the wrong pronouns (or at least that's how it feels), and probably hawk over it to ensure that the haircut isn't ""too dykey"". (&lt; actual quote) I want to join the Air Force. That's a lot of distinctly female treatment. The military isn't going to try to use gender neutral pronouns; that's a losing battle, at least for the next generation. I think Air Force formal uniforms require females to wear tights and skirts. Right now I feel like that would make me burst into tears. I'm so damn sensitive. I don't know what I would do. I'm starting to question whether I am making up all of this stress in my mind in a subconscious attempt to be special. Maybe if I force myself back into it, femininity will stop being so uncomfortable? I don't know. At one point I was fine with just being a tomboy, but now it's an emotional bomb I don't know how to deal with. Part of me wants this to be a phase so I can just be fine with being a girl. Is it wrong to feel that way? I have prided myself on self-respect; that thought just feels gross.

I'm going to cut this short before it becomes a novel. Writing this has helped me calm down. I'm pretty okay now. I'm not even sure if the above ramblings make any sense. I could just really use some words of wisdom on this stress and coping with the lack of control. If anyone has similar experiences to share, that would help a lot (novels welcome!).

127,2015-02-18 12:09:33,2wayw9,7,6,"I've been going through a huge identity crisis, and I have no idea who I am. It all started some months back when I fell into a deep depression, which I'll talk about later. 

A little about me: (sorry some of it is TMI)

I am a 22 year old male. After the past few months, I am pretty sure I am asexual, or some form thereof. 

When I was a kid, I always felt different from other guys. I was always more feminine than they were. I considered myself girly, but not a girl. I never thought I was a girl, I just thought that I wasn't as masculine as others. For a long time, I never connected with my gender. I didn't want to be a girl or think I was a girl, I just didn't quite fit in. So I didn't identify as being a guy. I always thought my being sensitive, small, and not liking sports made me not worthy of calling myself a guy. That

When I got to college, I really started identifying as a man. I started realizing that I could develop my own sense of masculinity. In my sense of masculinity, a man isn't the usual macho, insensitive, and aggressive person that society makes him out to be. Rather, a man is sensitive, loving, stands up for what he believes, loyal, etc. In addition, I thought that a man had both ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" characteristics. So I lived by that, and felt pretty happy when I was able to dress and act like the man that I thought represented masculinity.

I entered a depression last semester. To summarize, a girl I had once liked said some really awful things to me and told me that a real man doesn't wear nice clothes or act gentlemanly to everyone or cook (all things that I do/like to do). Combined with other circumstances in my life, I feel into a depression. After that, I started questioning my sexual and gender identities. 

I like women's fashion. I take an interest in what women wear, and like it when I see a well-dressed women. I also think men should have more variety in their wardrobe. To me, women have more variety. 

For the past few months I've been wondering if I'm trans. And I have no idea. I have never felt uncomfortable having a penis, nor have I ever wanted breasts or a vagina. On the contrary, I liked going into puberty and seeing more body hair and a deeper voice. I went to an all guys school, and I never felt uncomfortable being there. But I've been hung up on the idea that maybe I am trans.

I have a sexual fetish for women's and men's clothes. Not for everything, mostly women's hosiery, heels, and men's shoes. 

I really like how a few women look. So much so, that if I were a woman I would want to look like them. For instance, Audrey Hepburn. If I had to look like a woman, I would want to look like her. 

I am very self conscious about my voice. I really want to have a deeper voice, but I hate my current voice. 

I used to be really into men's and women's clothes, but recently I haven't been interested.

I don't mind having a penis, nor do I mind having facial or body hair. Actually, I quite like having facial and body hair. 

I've sort of lost touch with my own personal masculinity. I guess I just feel like I lost my identity or a part of me. 

I don't mind it when people see me as a man. 

I have thought about cross-dressing  for sexual pleasure and because I want to look sexy.

I also have a fetish for forced feminization and pegging. 

I have a bit of an odd relationship with my appearance. I like how I look (sometimes). But I always picture myself looking different. I always picture myself as a different, better-looking man. But then I look and I'm not. 

Most of my role models have been men. I always wanted to be a suave, well dressed man i.e. when I was younger I really wanted to be James Bond because he was good looking and just suave. 

I sometimes have trouble identifying with some men. I identify with some women, and I naturally get alone better with them and prefer their company. Additionally, when I'm around women I feel most like a man. 

When I'm around some guys, I feel they look at me like I'm weak or small or, quite frankly, a girl. And I don't like that. But when a girl sees me as a man, that makes me happy. 

Some other facts, I've freaked out and had breakdowns about other things. I had a period where I was afraid I was gay. My sister said I had homosexual OCD (HOCD). I once had an irrational and paranoid fear that I was going insane, when I was really just depressed. That being said, I wonder if my fear about being trans is just another one of those irrational fears I have. 

I'm really skinny, and I've had issues finding clothes that fit me like I would like. I am also extremely self conscious. As a result, there isn't much variety in my wardrobe. I fear that this combined with my interest in women's fashion makes me trans.

I have some ""feminine"" characteristics. I'm submissive, eager to please, I'm emotionally sensitive, and I like serving people. 

 I've always identified as being more feminine, but I've always known logically I was a boy. 

I've also seen myself as more masculine sometimes, as well. 

Last but not least, I've always been curious as to what it's like to be a woman.

With all of that being said, what do you think I am? Am I trans and in denial? Or am I just a cis guy who doesn't fit? Or am I something else? 

Also, thank you so much for reading this. And sorry about the wall of text or if I'm repeating myself.

Additionally, when I\'m around women I feel most like a man. \n\nWhen I\'m around some guys, I feel they look at me like I\'m weak or small or, quite frankly, a girl. And I don\'t like that. But when a girl sees me as a man, that makes me happy. \n\nSome other facts, I\'ve freaked out and had breakdowns about other things. I had a period where I was afraid I was gay. My sister said I had homosexual OCD (HOCD). I once had an irrational and paranoid fear that I was going insane, when I was really just depressed. That being said, I wonder if my fear about being trans is just another one of those irrational fears I have. \n\nI\'m really skinny, and I\'ve had issues finding clothes that fit me like I would like. I am also extremely self conscious. As a result, there isn\'t much variety in my wardrobe. I fear that this combined with my interest in women\'s fashion makes me trans.\n\nI have some ""feminine"" characteristics. I\'m submissive, eager to please, I\'m emotionally sensitive, and I like serving people. \n\n I\'ve always identified as being more feminine, but I\'ve always known logically I was a boy. \n\nI\'ve also seen myself as more masculine sometimes, as well. \n\nLast but not least, I\'ve always been curious as to what it\'s like to be a woman.\n\nWith all of that being said, what do you think I am? Am I trans and in denial? Or am I just a cis guy who doesn\'t fit? Or am I something else? \n\nAlso, thank you so much for reading this. And sorry about the wall of text or if I\'m repeating myself.

*Trigger warning (again), the following features talks about suicide and the murder of trans/GQ/NB people. Read at your own discretion. 

I've had fragments of this poem floating around in my head since the passing of Leelah Alcorn back in December. I wanted to write something specifically on her passing at that time, but didn't feel I had much place to as I didn't know her. As this year has progressed and so many trans women (and in specific trans women of color) have died my subconscious decided I had to write something and woke me up at 4am. Anyway, this is kinda second draftish (it's kinda hard to edit without tearing up), but I hope it touches some hearts.

""Dear You""

Dear you,

I wonder what you saw just before bright headlights 

made everything dim. 

I wonder if you saw the mirrored grace 

of a reflection that was almost yours. 

Dear you,

I wonder how the rope felt as you tied the knot 

that turned a closet into a coroners photograph

a picture of a frame that was never truly your own. 

Dear you,

I wonder what you heard between the chambered round ringing 

and the strike of the hammer. 

Was it a canticle chorus of ""God doesn't make mistakes"".

Dear you,

I wonder what you tasted as your fathers blade 

split into your stomach,

the foul bitterness of his words internalized 

that would spill across your tongue. 

Dear you,

I wondered what you smelled before fists
 
made matchsticks of your nose. 

Could you scent the panic he said he felt
 
before ending yours. 

Dear you,

I wonder what you were thinking as a dark alley 

made you disappear. 

Dreams of your future lived as yourself 

now entombed in those shadows. 

Dear you, I wish I didn't have these thoughts. 

Dear you, I wish I didn't have to write this poem. 

Dear you, I wish I could outstretch my arms,

Rampart my ribs and spire my spine 

to shield you from a world so filled with hate. 

But dear you,

You are no longer with us. 

And dear you,

I can only carry you in my heavy heart,

my mournful thoughts,

and my desperate prayers.

So dear you,

I write this as a record

And hope I never have

to add another line. 

Dear you,

I write this to your memory. 

Dear you,

I write to you with love.

Up until a month ago I identified as cis male and had 0 problems with that. I don't remember what caused me to question myself. I started asking myself things like, ""Am I ok with identifying as male?"" and every time I would answer ""I don't know"". I don't think I want to be a girl, I'm not sure.

I'm fine with my body and that I'm growing facial/body hair, have a deep voice etc, but I do get embarrassed when someone points it out (not sure if that has anything to do with this). Sometimes I look at girls (mostly in video games and anime) and think ""wow they are really pretty/beautiful or they have a nice voice"" I found this odd because I'm gay. I think I'm okay with male pronouns. Although, sometimes having body hair feels kinda... odd? I can't really explain it.


Ever since I first read about male puberty, I though it sounded cool and was excited to someday go through it, I remember in PE I used to look at the other guys armpits because I could see hair growing and hoped I'd get some soon.

142,2015-02-20 05:32:09,2wipls,4,3,"**Warning for discussions of mental health, self harm and transphobic/homophobic slurs I guess if that bothers you**

I've been wanting to say something about this on here for a while, but don't want to do it on my main account. Maybe see if anyone here has had near similar experiences, or maybe just to get it off my chest.

I've been generally confused about my gender and thinking I may be trans since last spring. The issue I'm talking about started last month.

I'm 16, afab (transboy? I don't know if I can claim that) and while I don't have a word for it, I've sort of got a voice. I mentioned it in the few other posts on this account (all of which I wrote in the middle of or coming down from an episode, so be aware). 

The voice, it's a male presence and he touches me (hardly ever in a sexual manner) and talks to me and sometimes makes me do things. The most recent issue is that he wants me to cut up my skin, which I do. But when we talk I don't feel like I'm really me or really real. I never see him. I think I do out of the corner of my eyes sometimes. He comes and goes. He can't understand me unless I respond aloud. He's not here now.

When he's good he's nice to me. He holds me and tells me I'm his good boy, his pretty boy, and that he loves me very much. He tells me if I do what he wants me to, he'll make sure I get a cock and a nice flat chest when I'm older. Says I'll be so happy. He'll call me a good girl sometimes, but that's less and less. He's so nice to me.

But when I don't listen to him or do something wrong or tell him he's not real, it gets bad. He makes me cut my skin when I do those things. He yells at me. Calls me a filthy tr*nny boy. A dirty f*g. Disgusting waste of space. Worthless. Says I'm a stupid bitch and I'm just pretending. It really fucking hurts when he does this.

I know its not normal to be hearing things, and I don't know if I'm actually trans or if its just a symptom of whatever else is happening. Looking in mirrors is hard but I don't know if I can't make the thing staring back feel like me because it has tits and fat thighs or because of how he makes me think. I'm scared I'm just like he said- pretending caught up in it.

I'm 16, still a dependent. I've been trying get mental health care, by my mom thinks it's just for anxiety and still hasn't gotten to it.

I mentioned it in the few other posts on this account (all of which I wrote in the middle of or coming down from an episode, so be aware). \n\nThe voice, it's a male presence and he touches me (hardly ever in a sexual manner) and talks to me and sometimes makes me do things. The most recent issue is that he wants me to cut up my skin, which I do. But when we talk I don't feel like I'm really me or really real. I never see him. I think I do out of the corner of my eyes sometimes. He comes and goes. He can't understand me unless I respond aloud. He's not here now.\n\nWhen he's good he's nice to me. He holds me and tells me I'm his good boy, his pretty boy, and that he loves me very much. He tells me if I do what he wants me to, he'll make sure I get a cock and a nice flat chest when I'm older. Says I'll be so happy. He'll call me a good girl sometimes, but that's less and less. He's so nice to me.\n\nBut when I don't listen to him or do something wrong or tell him he's not real, it gets bad. He makes me cut my skin when I do those things. He yells at me. Calls me a filthy tr*nny boy. A dirty f*g. Disgusting waste of space. Worthless. Says I'm a stupid bitch and I'm just pretending. It really fucking hurts when he does this.\n\nI know its not normal to be hearing things, and I don't know if I'm actually trans or if its just a symptom of whatever else is happening. Looking in mirrors is hard but I don't know if I can't make the thing staring back feel like me because it has tits and fat thighs or because of how he makes me think. I'm scared I'm just like he said- pretending caught up in it.\n\nI'm 16, still a dependent. I've been trying get mental health care, by my mom thinks it's just for anxiety and still hasn't gotten to it.\n\nI don't know who I am or what is happening. I'm scared.

I suppose if you were to put it on a spectrum, most of the time it hovers around: M----+--F

But I also have a fairly masculine personality in many ways... maybe it's my current hormonal setup? Maybe it's just how I am, but I kinda like ""traditionally"" masculine hobbies/interests despite my gender identity on most days.

I've known I've been pansexual for a few years now, I've been dating a wonderful transwoman and I've tangentially followed a few trans* communities for a while now. I've always questioned myself because I've always had anxiety and felt out of place. But I kinda put it all together, and it's left me all-at-once exhilarated, scared and thinking.

The best way to explain it is that I feel like a tomboy born as a male. I would love breasts and a female body (genitals could go either way, I flip flop), and I would like to be generally recognized at least mostly femme (not sure on label but not too concerned.) But I want to still have short-ish hair, dress fairly masculine (jeans, male/female button-up, canvas shoes) and still have a fairly butch attitude (still following me? lol.) Sexually I can get into being a top well enough but most days I'd rather bottom... in fact many times both in prior relationships with guys and casual sex, I always liked the idea of being held/cuddled/fucked like a girl.

I have a fairly middle-of-the-road voice in terms of pitch, skinny, tall with decently wide hips considering my sex and frame. Other than some proportions (and huge feet/hands ugh) I feel fairly blessed considering my desired presentation. I think I'd like hormones. I've seen what they do countless times and in person, and... idk I feel like the mood changes, body changes, everything seems to just look so, I don't know, desirable? I can't say I ever feel super dysphoric 90% of the time and if I ever do it's mostly my size/frame. But there's something about it that just seems right in a way.

So, guess I figured me out for the most part. That's pretty great really, but now I feel stuck. I know I'd have support if I came out, but... I'm not ready at all. I'm barely able to come out to myself. I shudder at the thought of telling my gf who herself is trans. Oddly enough I trans family as well. If anything that makes it feel worse? I don't want it to be ""special"", my family made a huge deal of it (in a good way) last time, I just wanna put it out there and be done with it. I guess the idea of social transitioning scares the shit out of me since I feel socially anxious in the first place.

Then there's the whole living my life as a non-binary individual. that... The idea terrifies me. Scares me shitless. But I really want it. It's almost like an emotional feeling of an immovable object being hit with an unstoppable force. I want it so bad, but I'm not ready in the slightest.

I think that if I could find a semi-offline channel where I could bother just a few individuals rather than a whole community, it would help me feel less like I'm appropriating or imposing.

So my question - is there such a place online? Like... are chat rooms still a thing? Or maybe I'm asking if there are people here who would like to have such conversations via PM?  Or are there special-purpose social networks? e.g. I'm also kinky, so if someone asked me the kinky-equivalent, I'd send them to fetlife.  Is there an analogue for genderqueer/non-binary/etc folk?

tl;dr: I want to find people willing to talk through stuff without taking up safe space yet.

[EDIT] - Corrected spelling

[EDIT #2] (All below this line)

So, I've been doing a lot of searching, and it seems like, contrary to my initial assumptions, posts along the lines of ""Can you help me figure out my identity"" would actually be on-topic here.  So I'm going to edit that in here.

So, up until recently, I identified pretty solidly as a cis-male, who was sorta hetero-flexible, and I identified as poly and a switch in the BDSM sense.  The bottom half of my switch is emotionally masochistic, and there was a lengthy period of time where I would get off on the sort of forced-fem fetish.  It was something I suppressed in myself, rather angrily, because I believed for the longest time that the only explanation for a forced-fem fetish was some messed up internalized mysogyny and trans-misogyny - I assumed that being turned on by these things was a moral failing.  Nonetheless, like any time you try to suppress an aspect of your sexuality, it wouldn't stay down and I'd have recurring moments of wanting it.

So fast forward to a few months ago, I'm having a discussion with a new kinky partner and we're doing the whole what-turns-you-on negotiation thing.  I'm talking to her about my emotional masochism, and giving examples of things that work, and sort of sheepishly admit this one.  I've never had a partner freak out before, but until this conversation I'd never gotten a response other than ""I accept that, but it's not my thing"".  So she's interested in trying it with me, a night of gender-bent stuff, she's even willing to don a strapon and gender-bend herself, even though it would be a new exploration for her as well.

In a moment of being overcome with gratitude at being accepted, I felt like I wanted to even put aside my emotional masochism to show her a good time - I felt like if we were going to try this, I wanted to be the ""best"" woman for her I could (not that I every truly understood what ""best"" would be).

Point is, we tried a night, it went well.  We tried a whole weekend genderbent, and it was amazing.  I got to wear lingerie, she dressed and acted more traditionally masculine.  I felt pretty, and it was strangely very validating.

So if that's all we had, I would mark this all up as a fetish and move on.  I have no desire to live that way full time, or even a majority of the time.  But there was more.  When I was in that ""mode"", I felt downright dysphoric about my penis.  I had to have sex with the panties on so I couldn't see it. I'd get upset-feeling if attention was drawn to it.  I'm a very hairy dude, and I positively *hated* my body hair.

So, I guess what I'm asking for input on is:
 (a) Is there pre-existing nomenclature for that - someone who feels distinctly masculine at some times, distinctly femme at others, and never any androgyny between.
 (b) I deal with a lot of guilt due to feelings that so much of ""femininity"" is socially constructed that my desires to be pretty and pleasing, to bake and to focus more on giving pleasure than receiving, etc are all just symptoms of a sexist worldview deep-down.

I think that if I could find a semi-offline channel where I could bother just a few individuals rather than a whole community, it would help me feel less like I\'m appropriating or imposing.\n\nSo my question - is there such a place online? Like... are chat rooms still a thing? Or maybe I\'m asking if there are people here who would like to have such conversations via PM?  Or are there special-purpose social networks? e.g. I\'m also kinky, so if someone asked me the kinky-equivalent, I\'d send them to fetlife.  Is there an analogue for genderqueer/non-binary/etc folk?\n\ntl;dr: I want to find people willing to talk through stuff without taking up safe space yet.\n\n[EDIT] - Corrected spelling\n\n[EDIT #2] (All below this line)\n\nSo, I\'ve been doing a lot of searching, and it seems like, contrary to my initial assumptions, posts along the lines of ""Can you help me figure out my identity"" would actually be on-topic here.  So I\'m going to edit that in here.\n\nSo, up until recently, I identified pretty solidly as a cis-male, who was sorta hetero-flexible, and I identified as poly and a switch in the BDSM sense.  The bottom half of my switch is emotionally masochistic, and there was a lengthy period of time where I would get off on the sort of forced-fem fetish.  It was something I suppressed in myself, rather angrily, because I believed for the longest time that the only explanation for a forced-fem fetish was some messed up internalized mysogyny and trans-misogyny - I assumed that being turned on by these things was a moral failing.  Nonetheless, like any time you try to suppress an aspect of your sexuality, it wouldn\'t stay down and I\'d have recurring moments of wanting it.\n\nSo fast forward to a few months ago, I\'m having a discussion with a new kinky partner and we\'re doing the whole what-turns-you-on negotiation thing.  I\'m talking to her about my emotional masochism, and giving examples of things that work, and sort of sheepishly admit this one.  I\'ve never had a partner freak out before, but until this conversation I\'d never gotten a response other than ""I accept that, but it\'s not my thing"".  So she\'s interested in trying it with me, a night of gender-bent stuff, she\'s even willing to don a strapon and gender-bend herself, even though it would be a new exploration for her as well.\n\nIn a moment of being overcome with gratitude at being accepted, I felt like I wanted to even put aside my emotional masochism to show her a good time - I felt like if we were going to try this, I wanted to be the ""best"" woman for her I could (not that I every truly understood what ""best"" would be).\n\nPoint is, we tried a night, it went well.  We tried a whole weekend genderbent, and it was amazing.  I got to wear lingerie, she dressed and acted more traditionally masculine.  I felt pretty, and it was strangely very validating.\n\nSo if that\'s all we had, I would mark this all up as a fetish and move on.  I have no desire to live that way full time, or even a majority of the time.  But there was more.  When I was in that ""mode"", I felt downright dysphoric about my penis.  I had to have sex with the panties on so I couldn\'t see it. I\'d get upset-feeling if attention was drawn to it.  I\'m a very hairy dude, and I positively *hated* my body hair.\n\nSo, I guess what I\'m asking for input on is:\n (a) Is there pre-existing nomenclature for that - someone who feels distinctly masculine at some times, distinctly femme at others, and never any androgyny between.\n (b) I deal with a lot of guilt due to feelings that so much of ""femininity"" is socially constructed that my desires to be pretty and pleasing, to bake and to focus more on giving pleasure than receiving, etc are all just symptoms of a sexist worldview deep-down.  Any advice on either overcoming these wants if they are problematic or accepting them if they are not?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'places for conversation', 'created': 1424588464.0}"

Its so weird the way the binary social system collides with anatomy and people's identity, it gets very confusing sometimes.

This is the first time I've actually spent time talking about my own gender issues using this account - it's usually devoted to talking about my relationship with my partner, who's a trans woman.

I've identified as genderqueer since long before it was ""cool"" - someone put the label on me twenty years ago and it stuck - but I haven't always been very visible or open about it. 

In the meantime, I ended up gravitating to other gender variant people, to the point where I have a really large number of trans friends (at least five of whom came out after I'd known them for a while). 

So now that I've been making moves toward being more openly genderqueer, I keep thinking to myself that I'm just copying people. I keep reminding myself that *I made friends with these people for a reason*, because we had things in common and gender variance is one of those things, but it still nags at me.

Hi, I'm DMAB, just turned 18 last month. I've had depression and anxiety for about 6ish years (idk might as well throw that in if it's important). Also please forgive me if I use some terms or say things wrong because I am new to all of this. For the last few months I've felt really... off? I realized a bit before reading/watching an anime/manga Hourou Musuko (which I really recommend) and reading/watching it helped me sort of figure out that most of the time (70%?) I feel ""male"", 10% I feel somewhere in the middle (but very confused), and then the other 20% definitely more ""female"". But I don't know if the ""male"" is just how I usually feel, not necessarily ""male"".

I'm just confused.

I am not necessarily upset with my current body, but I'm pretty hairy and have a strong jawline, so that's kind of ehh. I don't mind my genitals or whatnot. But sometimes I wish I could wear cute clothes (I'm really jealous of the options girls have for clothes), and I wish I could present as female and be female sometimes. I don't know.

I understand that I can be one or the other or both or neither. And I know I don't have to have a definitive answer to it.

I've only come out to two people (both of whom I only met like two weeks ago but they are both really cool and one is non-binary, so that help with making me feel more comfortable with telling them).

I feel like... how I currently am, presenting as male, I'm just okay with it. There are times when I know I would feel better as a girl and want to be a girl, but almost never I'm like ""YEAH LETS BE A DUDE"". I'm just okay with being born ""male"".

I’m really confused.

And i had someone who had told me that i was looking like a butch ( i think it's because some people  who have told me because i was wearing some guy clothes. I don't know if it's true or not but i like it :)

After i feel lot and lot more confortable about be with men clothes and act like a boy, even if i don't want to change my body  (even if sometimes i hate be a girl)

I Need some advice because since many yearts and it's recurrent, i have the desire to be a boy, sometimes i think i'm born in a not the good body, that i would have prefered to be a boy.
Because most of the time i hate be a girl for many things, and i don't have the desire to wear girls clothes or other things like this (sometimes i do exception).

Maybe take hormones yes.

But i need advice how i can be a boy when i'm a girl designed at birth and don't want to do operation (but want maybe to start hormone) and i don't think i want to open myself to a therapist.

This just barely came in, and I haven't got the time to dissect it right now.  What are all y'all's thoughts?

I've removed personally identifying stuff with what I think is most relevant in bold.

----------------------------

Dear REDACTED,

Thank you for contacting the Equality Advisory Support Service.

I understand that you wish to know what protection from discrimination the Equality Act 2010 provides for people in Scotland who are ‘gender fluid’ or ‘other non-binary gender’.

The Equality Advisory Support Service can provide you with general advice and guidance about the Equality Act 2010 but I must make you aware that we are unable to give any legal advice or opinions.  If you are considering any legal claim we would advise you seek advice from a qualified solicitor.

Protected Characteristics

The Equality Act 2010 protects a number of protected characteristics in England, Wales and Scotland.  Those characteristics include ‘sex’, ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender reassignment’.

**Reference to the protected characteristic of ‘sex’ under the act means physically being a ‘man’ or a ‘woman’.**

 ‘Sexual orientation’ means a person’s sexual orientation towards:

* People of the same sex as him or her (gay or lesbian);  
* People of the opposite sex from him or her (heterosexual);  
* People of both sexes (bisexual).  

‘Gender reassignment’ means as a person who has proposed, started or completed a process to change his or sex to the opposite sex. 

‘Fluid gender’ and ‘other non-binary gender’ are not specifically listed as protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 **and there has been no legal cases to date to test the court’s opinion on how a person who has a ‘fluid or other non-binary gender’ would be protected.** 

How a person is protected in each case is likely to vary depending on the type of discrimination itself.  For example:

a) A person who is biologically male but who is ‘fluid gender’ applies for a job in a women’s clothes store.  He is turned down for the job because he is biologically male.  This is likely to be considered as direct ‘sex’ discrimination.

b) A person who is ‘non-binary gender’ receives abusive remarks from a colleague who believes the person is ‘gay’.  The person doesn’t consider him or herself to be gay and is offended by the remarks.  This is likely to be considered as ‘sexual orientation related harassment’ which is unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act.

c) A person is biologically a women and considers herself as heterosexual and non-binary gender, decides to dress in male clothing.  She is told by her manager to go home to put a skirt on because all female staff are required to wear skirts as part of their uniform.  This could be considered as indirect ‘sex’ discrimination because the uniform policy is likely to be disadvantage more women than men and the individual has been disadvantaged. 

I hope that this information is useful to you.  For further information about the different protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 and prohibited discrimination you may wish to refer to our website at: www.equalityadvisorysupport.com.

Well, that's that.  Protection for genderfluid persons is not codified in law, and has yet to be tested in court.  There are actually no test cases to define what protections, if any outside of the realms of binary discrimination would be available.  Don't think the cited examples are wholly applicable, but they are what *has* been tested in court.

This just barely came in, and I haven't got the time to dissect it right now.  What are all y'all's thoughts?\n\nI've removed personally identifying stuff with what I think is most relevant in bold.\n\n----------------------------\n\nDear REDACTED,\n\nThank you for contacting the Equality Advisory Support Service.\n\nI understand that you wish to know what protection from discrimination the Equality Act 2010 provides for people in Scotland who are ‘gender fluid’ or ‘other non-binary gender’.\n\nThe Equality Advisory Support Service can provide you with general advice and guidance about the Equality Act 2010 but I must make you aware that we are unable to give any legal advice or opinions.  If you are considering any legal claim we would advise you seek advice from a qualified solicitor.\n\nProtected Characteristics\n\nThe Equality Act 2010 protects a number of protected characteristics in England, Wales and Scotland.  Those characteristics include ‘sex’, ‘sexual orientation’ and ‘gender reassignment’.\n\n**Reference to the protected characteristic of ‘sex’ under the act means physically being a ‘man’ or a ‘woman’.**\n\n ‘Sexual orientation’ means a person’s sexual orientation towards:\n\n* People of the same sex as him or her (gay or lesbian);  \n* People of the opposite sex from him or her (heterosexual);  \n* People of both sexes (bisexual).  \n\n‘Gender reassignment’ means as a person who has proposed, started or completed a process to change his or sex to the opposite sex. \n\n‘Fluid gender’ and ‘other non-binary gender’ are not specifically listed as protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010 **and there has been no legal cases to date to test the court’s opinion on how a person who has a ‘fluid or other non-binary gender’ would be protected.** \n\nHow a person is protected in each case is likely to vary depending on the type of discrimination itself.  For example:\n\na) A person who is biologically male but who is ‘fluid gender’ applies for a job in a women’s clothes store.  He is turned down for the job because he is biologically male.  This is likely to be considered as direct ‘sex’ discrimination.\n\nb) A person who is ‘non-binary gender’ receives abusive remarks from a colleague who believes the person is ‘gay’.  The person doesn’t consider him or herself to be gay and is offended by the remarks.  This is likely to be considered as ‘sexual orientation related harassment’ which is unlawful discrimination under the Equality Act.\n\nc) A person is biologically a women and considers herself as heterosexual and non-binary gender, decides to dress in male clothing.
