Lets talk about masturbating while non-binary! I am physically female and most of the time I am content with that, but tonight, as I put on the porn video, I wanted to be a boy.

So you know what I did?!

I grabbed my clit like one would a cock (well except it was with just my thumb and index finger as opposed to a whole hand) and I jerked it as if it were a small cock.

The orgasm that followed was so amazing!! I had to slow down a little, else it would be too intense and I would yell out... can't do that when everyone is home, lol.

So I was wondering, to those that do masturbate, how do you do it, or if you got any advice or tips, on masturbating when you aren't feeling like your physical gender.

12,2015-08-07 16:25:55,3g57wn,18,4,"My boyfriend (not quite girlfriend yet) wants to have sex with other people to fulfill his girl side desires. 

This goes against my beliefs, which are that sex is practically sacred and should be with only someone you truly love. Also that I dislike open relationships. If you are in a relationship, you should be able to be satisfied by your partner. 

I thought I had been pleasing him enough, I mean I even do him in the butt sometimes and I treat him like a full on girl. I get him dressed up and use female pronouns, etc... I thought I had been doing a pretty good job at it too.

When he told me these even larger desires, I frankly got pissed and upset. Because we have different views on love (his being that sex and love are totally separate and that you can have sex with more than just the person you are in love with, mine being that love and sex are connected and that it should be with someone you truly love and trust), we have drastically different opinions on this. 

He claims to love only me and that he wants to be in a relationship for a long time, however, these words just feel empty because he tends to not back them up with his actions.

Its gotten to the point where he says he wants a break, mainly to fulfill sexual desires. There are other reasons he says, but hey, no ones perfect. 

I wouldn't be able to handle being with him if he were to take his break and fulfill himself. I'd beat myself up over it, over feeling like not good enough, and I feel that I'd end up not being able to handle it and want to just be done. It goes against my internal code, and to me.. it's honestly just cheating in disguise.

I know how sexual urges work, and I know that it is what he craves. I just think that he needs self control. If you're in a committed relationship, there needs to be self control.

I know I've put him in a hairy situation by giving him these crossroads. I want him to be happy, but at the same time if I let him be happy, it will cause me unhappiness. I told him he can either get the dick he so badly wants and loose me, or he can stay faithful and not get any dick. He is unhappy either way though...

He says I need to be more open minded about it, but I feel like I've opened my mind enough. I'm fairly sure that most people would have left him by now(due to transgender, sexual kinks, attitude), but I haven't, and he seems to not realize that.

Also that I dislike open relationships. If you are in a relationship, you should be able to be satisfied by your partner. \n\nI thought I had been pleasing him enough, I mean I even do him in the butt sometimes and I treat him like a full on girl. I get him dressed up and use female pronouns, etc... I thought I had been doing a pretty good job at it too.\n\nWhen he told me these even larger desires, I frankly got pissed and upset. Because we have different views on love (his being that sex and love are totally separate and that you can have sex with more than just the person you are in love with, mine being that love and sex are connected and that it should be with someone you truly love and trust), we have drastically different opinions on this. \n\nHe claims to love only me and that he wants to be in a relationship for a long time, however, these words just feel empty because he tends to not back them up with his actions.\n\nIts gotten to the point where he says he wants a break, mainly to fulfill sexual desires. There are other reasons he says, but hey, no ones perfect. \n\nI wouldn't be able to handle being with him if he were to take his break and fulfill himself. I'd beat myself up over it, over feeling like not good enough, and I feel that I'd end up not being able to handle it and want to just be done. It goes against my internal code, and to me.. it's honestly just cheating in disguise.\n\nI know how sexual urges work, and I know that it is what he craves. I just think that he needs self control. If you're in a committed relationship, there needs to be self control.\n\nI know I've put him in a hairy situation by giving him these crossroads. I want him to be happy, but at the same time if I let him be happy, it will cause me unhappiness. I told him he can either get the dick he so badly wants and loose me, or he can stay faithful and not get any dick. He is unhappy either way though...\n\nHe says I need to be more open minded about it, but I feel like I've opened my mind enough. I'm fairly sure that most people would have left him by now(due to transgender, sexual kinks, attitude), but I haven't, and he seems to not realize that.\n\nHe's going to Burning Man this month, and it has me extremely worried.

23,2015-08-11 19:17:49,3gmnj5,12,11,"I have seen a number of trans people write blog posts and get angry over questions that a lot of non-trans people have. I don't quite understand why they get angry or upset... yes, people will often ask questions they wouldn't (under any normal circumstances) ask people who are non-trans, but the way I see it as this; I'd rather these people ask me strange or awkward questions and take a direct interest in the process and talk to them through it, rather than give them a cold shoulder or blow off. Every time you blow a person off because you think a question is stupid or bad or insulting, you have one less person trying to understand you. That is one less person who may have stood up for you in the future. If a question makes you uncomfortable, don't get angry or upset, just explain that the question makes you uncomfortable and avoid the rants about why its a stupid question (which would probably take far more time to explain).
 
You see, people tend to naturally understand female and understand male, so they don't really have much in the way of questions for the female/male body process so there's few questions to ask, but what many people don't understand is transitioning or the transition process... so, when they're asking these questions out of ""ignorance"", they're generally not asking them to be offensive, they're asking out of genuine curiosity because it's something they don't understand and they would like to.... which is why they are asking. For me, I'm even okay with strangers asking about my body parts when they find out I'm trans. I get it, they're curious, they want to have an understanding of the process.. and I'm okay with that curiosity. To be curious is to be human.
 
The other thing a lot of people talk about, staring.... people will often stare at trans people when they're noticed. Of course, this does make a lot of trans people uncomfortable as well... but, I think a good thing to remember when this happens is that not everyone is staring at you because they think you're strange or you're a freak... people stare when they take an interest in something or they are curious about something. You are interesting them, while they are staring at you they are thinking about you, being curious about you, and wondering about you. Not all stares come from people judging you or disapproving of you... and that's something maybe people have to remember when they notice strangers staring. Don't feel bad because they are staring... instead, feel empowered because someone is taking an interest in you. Smile, wave, make them laugh, leave them with a positive impression of you, and you of them. It'll make both your days a little brighter.

36,2015-08-23 15:58:34,3i391h,13,4,"Last night my girlfriend sent me this comic from the excellent ""The Trans Girl Next Door"" by Kylie Wu. http://transgirlnextdoor.tumblr.com/post/127354366269

It made me feel uncomfortable, both because of the content and how I view myself. I should explain; I have exclusively dated trans-women for the last 8 years. I have an overwhelming attraction to trans-women, to the exclusion of cis-women. I have known about this since 5th grade. While all my friends were talking about how attractive they found Cathy Ireland, I was thinking she was okay but I was extremely attracted to Tula.

The comic above paints trans-oriented men in a negative light, and in some ways that is understandable. If you look at the average guy in a club or a bar, (which is where it looks like this takes place) the single guys there will be looking to pick up women to bring home. (please note not all guys!) they aren't looking for a relationship, they are looking for sex. If you took the bottom scenario, and removed any reference to trans, it is still the same fantasy for douchebag guys everywhere. Sex without strings.

Now, I know there are plenty of trans-oriented men who are like this. But, I am going to say, to dismiss an entire group of people based on their attractions, because of a perceived stereotype is predjudicial.

So let's talk about trans-oriented men. Why do they have such a bad reputation. First, I would suggest is ignorance. Trans-oriented men through out a large part of the country, never met a trans-woman. They know of trans-women through tabloid television and porn. I am guilty as charged. Those were my first experiences with trans-women. Neither portrays an accurate or reasonable portrayal of who trans-women are. It leads to a prejudice in men that trans-women are extremely sexual. The general world at large also does not do enough to distinguish, cross dressing and drag from being a trans-woman. So if a man does seek out what he thinks is going to be a trans-space, he will go to a drag bar, where his stereotypes will be reenforced by prostitutes, and cross dressers who are looking for sex. I am not looking down on cross dressers by the way, but they are not the same as trans-women. If the bottom scenario in the comic was to happen there would most likely be a request for payment somewhere along the line.

The second is society. I have read some recent articles that say that in someways it is harder for a man to be trans-oriented than it is to be trans in this society. In my not so humble position, that is totally BS. I have seen what trans-women go through and I have been open about being trans-oriented and let me say there is no comparison. Watching a loved one being denied a bathroom in a public and humiliating way is far more hurtfull then being called faggot by a couple of kids at the mall. Still, there is a lot of fear about being different and people have such anxiety about coming out, that it does become a real issue for some people. Passability, becomes a ""need"" in order to protect the closet. So, trans-oriented people will tend to exclusively look for passable women to date, so that no one knows their secret. To be fair, in some parts of the United States, it is dangerous to be out. I would not want to go to parts of Texas and be openly trans-oriented. In someways, It becomes easier to be with a cis-woman and experiment with a trans-woman prostitute. I strongly feel that is why stories where a celebrity being caught with a trans-woman prostitute happen.

Personally, I worked through a lot of my feelings a while ago. I was fortunate enough, to have met wonderful people from all walks of life from the trans-community and I was smart enough to keep my mouth shut and my ears open to learn. I met wonderful people, who had hard breaks and were forced into sex work. I met determined people who worked hard and succeeded in their chosen field. I met people who managed to hide their status and live in total stealth. I met people who could not hold a job and were forced to live on Wellfair. I met nice people, crazy people, wealthy people, poor people, mean people, sexy people, unsexy people. In the end it boiled down to this: trans-people are people. They deserve the same respect and consideration as any other group of people. If I was truly attracted to trans-women, I needed to be fully open and honest about that. And, I came out. (hi, I'm straight!) I explained who I was and who I was attracted to in a Facebook post (my family already knew.) and I got positive feedback. I lost one friend, who was just a redneck kid who I didn't really care about anyway. Being out ment that I was able to date wonderful people, who I was extremely attracted to. I was able to be myself.

So, if you are trans-oriented, check out tsgirlfriend.com and transoriented.com. Both are great resources with articles for you to learn from. If you are looking to meet trans-people, don't do it through a gay bar or a drag club. Check out OK Cupid and answer an ad. Be upfront about who you are, but don't go looking for sex.

If you are a trans-woman, don't ignore a ""chaser"" out of hand. If you think there is some decency in someone, then at least talk to them. Chasers are people too.

0,2015-08-01 00:57:39,3fcxsd,3,6,"I'm not really sure why I'm posting this - I already sent the letter yesterday, and my therapist doesn't even come back from vacation until Monday. I haven't been able to function at work this week at all. Yesterday I was very frustrated and impatient - I have the medical go-ahead to start T, why do I have to wait?!? But today I guess I'm back feeling blah, wondering if this is the right decision.

Anyway, I guess I'm posting this in case it helps any other guys/genderfolk who need to write something similar. I'll update next week with my therapist's response.

&gt; Dr. [therapist] -

&gt; July has been a very rough month. It has been very difficult to function at work/school. The next available appointment I could get with you was [8 days from now], but if you have any thoughts on what I'm about to say, please let me know before that? Even if it's only what I should expect when we next meet.

&gt; Around the time of our last meeting I made an appointment with an endocrinoloigist for continued sleuthing on my abnormal PCOS. This endo, Dr. [endo] at the [hour drive away from me] office, also works with transgender patients, so I asked my PCP to add gender identity disorder to the referral. I explained to her that although I am nonbinary, I feel very strongly about starting a low dose of testosterone. My motivations may be different than most: I believe my brain is wired to run off of a certain mix of hormones, and my current T levels are too low, which I believe is at least partially causing the persistent depressive disorder I have suffered from most of my life. (I have not been diagnosed specifically with this or its pre-DSM-5 counterpart dysthymia, but I read up on it and it seems spot on to my experience.) I think this is also the cause of me feeling really ""off-balance"" recently that I had mentioned (and has continued throughout July). I'm not a doctor, but my bioavailable testosterone last week seemed to be in the low end of even the ""female"" range, [number] compared to [range] for adult females. In March it was [slightly higher number], and Jan 2013 it was [double that but still in middle of female range], so this is the lowest I've ever seen it.

&gt; I have researched the potential physical changes that may come with even a low dose of testosterone. There is practically nothing in the scientific literature so I have to rely on what other nonbinary people have posted online about their experiences with low-dose T. Some of the changes I would like, and the rest I can accept. Of the permanent effects, I DO want a lower voice and larger genitals, more body and facial hair wouldn't bother me (I already have to shave my face), and male pattern baldness isn't great but I'm starting to get that anyway. With a low dose, I can go slowly and stop if things begin to develop in a way I don't like.

&gt; Dr. [endo] said she has not treated a nonbinary person before, but seemed open. The biggest relief was when she agreed immediately about the mental benefits of HRT being more than just happiness at starting a transition, since ""hormonal dysphoria"" is the part I feel the most strongly about and has NO research on it yet. I gave her a printout of this link http://neutrois.me/2012/08/27/low-dose-testosterone/ and she took it and said she wanted to do some of her own research. When I told her I could probably get a letter from a gender therapist she said that would be very helpful, asked if you have worked with other nonbinary people (I wasn't sure), and said if you consented she might want to speak with you on the phone. My impression is that this is new to her, but she's open to it and wants to make sure she does it right, and follow any established guidelines that she may not know about.

&gt; I forgot to tell her how in 2011, version 7 of the WPATH Standards of Care had significant changes made to it such that it accomodates nonbinary people seeking medical transition. Gender therapist Dana Hoffman-Fox talks more about that and specifically what it means for HRT letters here: http://darahoffmanfox.com/ask-gender-therapist-can-transition-im-non-binary-genderfluid/

&gt; To sum up: I have thought about starting a low dose of T for almost a year now, and very seriously for the past month or two, for the purposes of mental balance and some physical androgynization. I have done my research and understand the side effects, both beneficial and not. I can accept the not-so-wanted permanent effects happening to my body, not as a distant risk factor but as a real probability. I believe using a low dose of T would give me time to asses its effects before many physical changes take place. Dr. [endo] has looked over my bloodwork and said I am physically okay to start testosterone, and we know which medical complications I should keep an eye on. I have discussed this with my partner, my mother, my live-in brother, and my closest friends, and they all agree with my assesment and decision. I feel very strongly that this is the right course of action to treat my dysphoria and dysthymia, and want to pursue it without further delay. If your professional opinion agrees, will you write me an HRT letter?

Hi all, I'm what I thought was a straight female until about a year or so ago. I don't know exactly when it started, but I was always attracted to only straight guys until I realised that I wasn't.

It's not that I don't like them anymore -however, since about a year ago, all the feelings have started to get a bit messed up. For starters, I really like gay guys, and not just in the friendly sense of way. Seeing two guys together in more than just friendship way just makes my heart beat fast. Seeing pictures of guys kissing makes me excited. But I read lots of slash fanfiction, so at first I thought maybe I was just fetishising. But then I realised that I didn't just want to watch two guys together, I wanted to be them.

I grew up in a developing country where gay people aren't as common, or at least not out of the closet. I'd never even seen a live gay person until I moved to another country a year ago. I stood in line behind a gay couple at a supermarket, and just seeing them made me happy. I happily told them they make a cute couple, paid for my things and went home. And broke down in tears. It was then that I realised something might not be right about me. I wanted to be like them; I wanted to have what they have. I had a bit of a panic attack. Now, looking at gay guys makes me both elated and sad, with a feeling of longing and confusion.

The thing is, I don't mind being a girl. I like having my female assets, yet at the same time, I also want to be a gay guy. I just don't understand?

Also, I think I might like girls too, but mostly if they look somewhat androgynous. I mean, there have been girly girls that I think I could've developed a crush on, given some time, but I quite like if their appearance is androgynous or ambiguous. So there's that too.

I don't understand what's going on. I'm only 18, so is it some kind of phase or whatever? Am I making too big of a deal out of it? Am I supposed to just ignore and see how it plays out?

16,2015-08-03 08:24:31,3flk3h,6,7,"Hey all. You may have guessed from the title that a) I'm considering top surgery and b) I am kinda lost. I'll try to put all my relevant information here so those who may reply have more to work off of.

I currently live and am employed in Oregon, but I am still under my parents' insurance (Blue Shield of California) and am going to be legally independent next calendar year, as my parents did not claim me on their latest tax documents. However, I am only out to my parents in terms of sexuality and not gender identity, which is one of my largest obstacles other than the 20% of the surgery I'd have to pay even if insurance covered it (I heard someone with the same insurance had to pay $3K copay which I can't do right now (and doesn't mathematically make sense considering the average total costs I've heard but whatever)). I don't know if insurance things would be sticky due to ""medical non-necessity"" because I'm non-binary or because my dysphoria isn't life-threatening at this point, but the wording on the documents is inconsistent at best. At this point though, even with insurance it's not pocket money for me.

What I do know right now is that I really don't like having bewbs and this heat wave makes my dysphoria worse on top of making binding more uncomfortable even with just a sports bra. I can't stop thinking about top surgery and how beautiful and awesome a flat chest would be. I just don't know how to navigate the parents/insurance thing. It's highly recommended I go to therapy anyway so I can just play that as personal need, so is this what I should do first and foremost? Perhaps they'd have more information but I'm unsure. 

Would I be better off trying to change insurance? This may be difficult as I'll have to carefully navigate the issue with my parents, who in the past have told me that I need them to make my decisions for me, that I'm ill, that I'm punishing them, etc, but when it's all said and done they pretend they never said such things. The problem is getting to the ""all said and done"" part, here. (My stepdad flipped out like that when I texted my sister something shitty my mom said about her, so, imagine their reaction to surgery.)

Then, there's timing and location considerations. This summer I am just teaching math and doing physics research (theoretical, so computer work thus sitting) which would give me flexibility for recovery. My school year will be very busy, so that time frame's out. During this year or so I'll be in northern Oregon, for which I've found two surgeons, but after this year everything's up in the air as I don't know when or where I'll be attending grad school. Thus I'm feeling a sense of urgency to take advantage of Oregon's relatively less-transphobic laws. 

So I don't really know where to start with all these seemingly insurmountable obstacles. Coming out to parents? Telling parents I want to transition? Keeping insurance, saving up, and waiting? Or changing insurance if something cheaper is possible so I can start sooner? Even if I can fund the surgery no problem the parents part is an issue -- they are the loose cannon type. I realize you can offer advice on how to navigate coming out, but it is ultimately up to me. The insurance thing I could use some advice and guidance on, because I keep seeing these copays for top surgery under $100 and I can't figure it out.

Apologies for all this brainspew. It's a result of my tiredness and frustration. 

Bonus: I found one of my post-op burning questions asked on a forum but unanswered: In places where it's illegal for females to be topless, would it be legal for someone not FTM but with a masculine chest to be topless?

But yeah, title is basically it. As someone who has been applying for jobs in IT, it was sorta difficult to deal with being the only ciswoman (who happens to be also the only person of color) in my IT group, but since I recently came out as genderqueer, I'm really having an extra hard time trying to figure out how to deal with ""professionalism"" and well...bathrooms while I'm applying for other IT jobs.

By professionalism, I mean the whole thing. From clothes, to mannerism, to social media (linkedin), etc. For clothes, I'm fortunate that IT is pretty casual (I mean as casual as polos get) but I'm honestly thinking of going into law and the only trans* lawyer I know are Dean Spade who is pretty binary (as in, does not really push against the expectations of gender attire as far as I am aware of). What kind of jobs y'all have? What do you wear? Use any tailors? Where do you get your clothes?

My voice is so fucking high pitch, I could legit be in a children's cartoon for the squicky side kick (maybe that's my life purpose?). So I feel this pressure to be professional as a woman when interacting with customers (in terms of pitch of voice, actions, etc.). Like, it's so obvious to me that I emulate my mother rather than my father when I interact with customers. I thought of following advice that's out there to change my voice, but...I kinda don't? My squeakiness is my so part of me that I just want to keep it but be the professional that I /want/ to be. Uuuugh, i don't know how to explain it. Any thoughts?

Last bit, while my FB is in lock-down, there's the issue of LinkedIn. My side job is related to gender and sexuality advocacy so I have so much work experience in queer issues, but I have a whole other side of experiences in IT, design, coding, etc. Is it common to have two LinkedIn accounts? Any issues of employers seeing both? I mean, I guess if you don't use a picture then you could deny the other is you...but, having a picture is so common in LinkedIn. I've thought of going to my career center in my university to ask questions on resumes/linkedin since they put a lot of workshops on it, but I feel like it'll be the usual where the staff person just doesn't what to say because they see me as some rare fabled unicorn that they never thought they'll see in the wild.  

Side thing, but my side job is constantly asking all staff to post up a bio and pic to be more visible to the public and of course, I just so happen to be the only person who isn't cis who happens to be also the only one who has an issue with public pics of myself. Has anyone had any experience with this? I'm tired of having to remove myself from this job just because of future job concerns because I take pride in my work and well...my presence in my position.

35,2015-08-06 20:34:26,3g1rgu,4,1,"I'm an AMAB non-cis person in my early twenties. 
 
So, I have been struggling with gender issues for about an year or so. I know I'm not cis, and yet struggle to decide what I am due to wanting to be true to myself. What I have read around the internet, it seems that many people who come to this realization automatically assume they are binary and not the gender they are assigned at birth, and thus are the other binary gender. 

For me this made sense and I thought of myself to also be this way. But then the confusion came. As I had identified with trans-women and thought I'm like them, I came to the realization that in my (obviously ignorant) mind a trans-woman was not the same thing as a woman at all. Thus I believe I had not read them correctly. Rather I had viewed trans-women as sort of being outside of the binary.

Similarily I cannot imagine myself to be a woman, in a sense that for example my mother and sisters are. I can't believe any cis-woman could be like I am. I know I'm feminine, but I can't help my mind being somehow male or without gender. I believe I have always been like this, and am somehow afraid of losing myself if I were to live solely as a woman. Trans-woman is better because it includes the possibility that the person is not a woman as AFAB women are, but if I would identify as that, would not it be offending to trans-women who see themselves as fully women?

As I explored my gender and identified as a trans-woman I tended to be pressured to think that any masculine or ""male""-labeled feeling is labeled such because of my life as a male, or as internalized sexism that women can't be masculine. I felt strange pressure to do this. But then I noticed that while I was thinking that a female can have any kind of masculine feeling ever, even wanting to have a penis, I didn't notice that I never did the same other way around. This I think is because I already had contributed to the traditional binary trans narrative, which claims that binary gender is somehow essential (my being not that which I had been assigned and thus the other one), and had not thought of any alternatives. Also I think this is highly encouraged, because transitioning ""just works"". This has still confused me to no end. 

Sometimes I came to the conclusion that I'm not a trans at all, and then felt really good about being a male and remembered moments in my life when I was feeling really good about being a man. I tend to think that if I was born a female, I would have gotten similarily dysphoric at some point. I don't believe my mind or soul or brain is essentially female in any sense, nor that I was meant to be a girl. I want to be able to be seen feminine, but it doesn't mean to be seen as a woman or all-female. I believe I could be seen as a ladyboy or anything that (btw for me a ""ladyboy"" or some similar being is the only form of androgyny coming from the male side that I know of) expresses femininity in a plausible way. 

Many seem to claim the main point to be comfortable, and to be outside the same as inside, and to be true to oneself, and to just be yourself. I don't know how I would be comfortable or to be myself. The idea of losing my body or getting by balls chopped is intuitively horrifying, but sometimes when dysphoric, I want to transition to the female body, but not to be female or woman, but to be feminine. Dressing as a woman feels good but the thought of everyone seeing me solely as a woman feels wrong in some way, because I feel trapped. Many times it also seems that masculinity is followed by pressure to be feminine. I have had this go both ways, sometimes after being really feminine some masculine energy flows back to my body strongly only to make it go the other way again.

Has anyone though similar things? I'm hoping for any kind of pointers or information.

Genderfluid is the closest thing I've come to describing how I feel, and I've been on a mild female swing (internally) for a few weeks now (probably the longest I've ever been this side of centre, but not the strongest).

For the last few years, I've had a small beard - I've long ago concluded my face needs it. However, I'm very critical of my beard-growing potential. My male side is quite happy with one, and wants it to look good. But sadly, my face disagrees, and usually I think any attempts at growing a beard, beyond the basic goatee I had until lately, look naff.

So after going clean shaven for the first time in years, a few weeks back, I've since attempt to grow a more substantial beard. However, my latest attempt, currently sitting at around a month, started to feel out of place in the last couple of days, so I decided I was going to get rid.

However, I have considerable peer pressure to keep my beard, as all I agree I look better with. So I decide to groom and style the beard a bit first, to see how it would look. And so now I'm stuck with a beard that I think looks awesome, when I'm also sitting here feeling I'd rather not have a beard at all.

46,2015-08-08 06:06:40,3g7vn6,2,7,"This is more of a confessional than a question, but I just feel like I need to put my thoughts down somewhere. 

My whole life I've been very confused/conflicted about my sexuality and my gender. I am AMAB but I have always had ""feminine mannerisms and interests."" When I was little I loved dressing up in my mom's clothes and would always wear her old dance costumes to put on shows with my cousin. My parents divorced when  I was 3 and I lived with my mom and little sister. I have always felt more comfortable around women than men, and just generally get along better with them. 

When  I was in high school I came out as bi, but after college and being exposed to a wider world view, I now Identify as queer. I dropped bi because I don't like it's reliance upon a gender binary, especially since I am particularly attracted to people who fall in the middle, though gender expression and identity really have no bearing on who I find attractive. 

Now that I feel like I understand my sexuality, I have started thinking about my gender identity. I definitely identify as male, though I don't feel like I identify as a man, if that makes any sense. I have a very feminine affect, which makes most people just assume I am gay. It's more than  that though. I love styles and fashions that are typically seen as feminine. I also feel really empowered when I dress in ways that challenge gender norms. This really started in high school. I loved the way thongs looked on women so I convinced my step mom to buy me some men's thongs. I started only wearing them around the house and on weekends, but eventually started wearing them full time. By the time I got to college, I was only wearing thongs and bikini briefs, but I was tired of paying a fortune for them and not being able to find them in my size. My girlfriend at the time was really supportive and encouraged me to try women's panties. After wearing that first pair, I never went back. At first I thought it might be a sexual thing or a fetish, but I realized that it wasn't that wearing panties turned me on, it was that they made me feel sexy. For, really the first time, I felt attractive. After that, I started wearing women's skinny jeans. Now I wear mostly men's slim fit jeans since they fit a bit better, but I recently started wearing leggings. I love wearing clothes that have feminine silhouettes and are especially feminine. I would love to wear dresses and skirts, but when I have, I felt like they don't look right. Unfortunately, my physical features are not feminine. I am fairly overweight, and have really thick facial and body hair, while balding at the age of 26.

This combination of issues has me really frustrated with my wardrobe. The looks I want to achieve, I can't pull off. I know I need to lose weight and I am hoping these realizations will help give me the motivation I need to get healthy, but in the meantime I wish I could fine a way to dress more feminine. The other issue that compounds the clothing conundrum is that I am a high school teacher in a fairly conservative area. I am the drama coach and have worn leggings to several rehearsals and my drama kids have been amazingly supportive. The one time I wore skinny jeans to work though, I overheard a lot of ignorant, childish comments. I'm fine with having two separate styles but it does get frustrating when I really want to get my nails done, but know I can't because of school. 

Anyway, I don't know what I am looking to get out of this, but it did feel good to manifest these thoughts in writing. Thanks for giving me a forum!

First, stuff about myself.  I'm 23, and a man though I have never actually identified personally with that notion.  I have realized recently that it is my personal sense of justice and my ideals that dictate pretty much everything I do, not my gender, and contrary to what I used to think, I'm not a very logical person at all, my gut is definitely captain of this ship.  The pursuit of beauty and truth are sacred to me above all else, and I would do anything for that quest.  When I need to be masculine and in control, I am, but naturally I am very gentle and more feminine.  I have no desire to control others or to be controlled, and I have as many masculine habits and hobbies as I do feminine ones.  In bed I care most about pleasing my partner, and am willing to do whatever to that end.  I am tall and athletic but have been mistaken for a female by cat calling males (they called me sexy and babe...I don't even know) a couple times since I grew my hair out down to my traps.  In High School I had thoughts about guys, once I got flushed and my heart rate shot up just from looking at a guy I only saw once, but as I have gotten older that's never happened since and I never went for anything cause raised Catholic (now agnostic).  I am now only attracted to girls, but I have a pretty good feeling that I would go for a guy if he was feminine enough, never had the chance to test that though.  Sometimes I imagine myself as a woman in my head, it's strangely calming and sometimes helps me understand what I need to do to satisfy my personal justice, and often I hate being treated or acting like a 'man'.  That being said, being a man or being a woman don't mean anything to me at all really, and in the end, I'm left a tad confused.

On to my current understanding of wtf gender is doing.  The ways I sees it, the binary is a load of shit that came about because it was easy, necessary even.  In a world of war and strife, two things mattered, strong soldiers and the means to make more.  Thus men fought and killed, and women made more poor sods to fill their shoes.  Derived from this, men naturally became solely providers and women homemakers.  Now that our world isn't quite so crazy, and these gender roles no longer necessary in the slightest, I feel that we will maybe create a new system of gender roles to suit what I believe are our natural social tendencies, as opposed to our biological imperatives.

If you're wondering wtf I want, I suppose I just want some feedback.  How should I think of myself, how should I get people to treat me like me and not like what they want me to be.  What do you think of my views, or rather, where do you think this whole trans queer shebang is heading?  What is this communities goal and endgame?

Often, but not always, unpleasant. It seems to me that many binary folks who experience dysphoria have a set path of changes: permanently changing their name, pronouns, and body.

For me, my gendered state is not permanent, so most options don't seem like they'd be useful to me. Additionally, each procedure comes with its own set of risks.

So I listened to a [Radiolab podcast](http://www.radiolab.org/story/invisibilia/) where they interviewed someone AMAB who switched between genders in a binary sort of way. However, when they checked in with her later she said she always felt female. This was attributed to her doing hormone therapy.

I'm wondering if my hormones are off and if taking estrogen will be the path of least resistance to having my gender bother me the least. I know some people take low doses to help with acne. Whereas testosterone will change me in ways I may or may not want and also fairly permanently.

I've been repeatedly told that GQ people want the same things I do and the GQ label has been suggested for me quite often.

I'm going to be getting my hair cut and bleached soon, so it'll be about chin/jaw length in the color that the bottom is dyed rn. I may go shorter w/ time since I've had a short-haired undercut before and it looked really nice.

114,2015-08-18 04:45:40,3hep59,6,5,"**Hi. I recently posted this to AskGSM and was told to post here as well for more insight, so here it is.**  

I apologise for any mistakes I may make in posting this. I am inexperienced in posting things on Reddit. I also apologise if I use the incorrect terms; I am admittedly not well-versed in a lot of LGBTQ terminology, but I shall try my best. *This is a long post without a TL;DR that may be a pain to read so if that sounds like something you're not willing to deal with you should click out now.*  

As the title states, I am feeling increasingly confused. Over the years, I have gone through many self-discoveries and after every single one of them I've thought, ""That's it. There's nothing left. This is who I am."" But there's always something that comes after and poses a new question of my identity.

I haven't said how I identify yet, and that's because I'm finding it hard to pinpoint exactly *what* I am. I feel like I don't know the words. So what I'm going to do is describe to the best of my ability (keeping in mind that I'm not good with the terminology) what I thought of myself as a year ago, when I last felt like I knew all there was to know about myself. I suppose that I would have told you I am a cisgender, bisexual, transvestite, 19-year-old male.

I don't particularly like the term 'transvestite' as I feel that, ideally, clothes would not have to be assigned to any specific gender and there would be no question of anyone wearing a specific item (such as women wearing jeans now.) But I acknowledge that I have had an interest in wearing female clothing for most of my life. I am not a very fashion-conscious person and I am constantly wearing men's underwear, jeans, and a t-shirt. It's not uncommon for me to be interested in a some women's clothes though, and I find myself wishing I could wear them. In particular I have always wanted to wear a wedding dress, simply because I think they are elegant and beautiful (though I am indifferent to marriage itself).

This is coupled with some confusing bouts I have had with gender. I am a fan of video games, and since Pokemon FireRed I have always played as a girl when given the option. I can offer little explanation as to why this is except that I just prefer it to playing as a male.

I have also posed as a woman online in two instances. The first was in an online game, where I created an alternate account claiming to be a friend of myself that used my computer occasionally. The second was on a small forum created by an online friend. I was originally going to do it jokingly, but as a 14-year-old I pretended I was a 21-year-old woman who knew my online friend. Again, I can offer little explanation as to why I did these things. I simply wanted to at the time, and if I were to analyse it now I might say that perhaps I was exploring my own gender identity. I did not catfish anyone or anything like that; it was purely for myself.

I have been with my girlfriend, who is also bisexual, for almost two years now. I have disclosed everything that I have here with her. She is the only person I feel I can claim I have had any significant sexual or romantic attraction to in my life. I have found that on occasion I will feel quite jealous of her body, in the sense that I wish I could be as beautiful and feminine as she is. And I think that, hypothetically, if I could have her body as my own, I would be absolutely happy to do so.

I have tried wearing my girlfriends clothing (which she approves of) at times, but as she is very small and petite (5'1"") and I am tall and lanky (6'2"") I do not fit very well or at all in any of them. The best I've done is some of her stockings which make my legs feel sexy.

In many instances I have said that I am comfortable with being a man, and that I wouldn't mind being a woman, and I think this is true to some degree. Some days I find myself looking in the mirror and being proud of my appearance and masculine features I have. On others, which are fewer, I find myself upset that I am not more feminine and wishing that I could be a woman.

For the record, I do not attempt to appear androgynous in any way. I have grown out facial hair and do not wear make up, which kind of brings me to what has recently been bothering me...

I have always thought that makeup is unnecessary and I prefer when my girlfriend does not wear it, though she very rarely does anyway. However, recently on one of my 'wishful' days, I shaved my facial hair off and secretly used my mother's makeup, wondering how I would look. I inevitably did a poor job of applying it but I found that I was overjoyed to see how feminine I looked and felt with it. After admitting the incident to my girlfriend, she happily offered to help me put on makeup and we had fun doing so together.

I've rambled on a lot about all of these things that muddle my thoughts about my gender identity, and I feel like it should be clear to me how I should identify, but it isn't. I've never looked into LGBTQ communities, honestly, and I've previously felt like I did not need to bother with labels or terms, but the more I think about it, the more I become frustrated that I just don't seem to know what to call myself. It makes me feel like I don't know what to say when I explain these things about myself to other people except weak phrases such as ""I'm weird"" and ""I don't know"". I guess I wish I could safely say I was one thing or another, but I don't know enough to do so, and what I have read I feel like I can't relate to, which is strange. I feel like I'm too ignorant and that using any labels to describe myself would somehow be insulting those people, like people who self-diagnose mental disorders when they truly are able-minded.

Already in this post I feel like I must have said a number of things to offend any amount of people, as much as I hope that I haven't. Perhaps I'm being paranoid though.

In particular I have always wanted to wear a wedding dress, simply because I think they are elegant and beautiful (though I am indifferent to marriage itself).\n\nThis is coupled with some confusing bouts I have had with gender. I am a fan of video games, and since Pokemon FireRed I have always played as a girl when given the option. I can offer little explanation as to why this is except that I just prefer it to playing as a male.\n\nI have also posed as a woman online in two instances. The first was in an online game, where I created an alternate account claiming to be a friend of myself that used my computer occasionally. The second was on a small forum created by an online friend. I was originally going to do it jokingly, but as a 14-year-old I pretended I was a 21-year-old woman who knew my online friend. Again, I can offer little explanation as to why I did these things. I simply wanted to at the time, and if I were to analyse it now I might say that perhaps I was exploring my own gender identity. I did not catfish anyone or anything like that; it was purely for myself.\n\nI have been with my girlfriend, who is also bisexual, for almost two years now. I have disclosed everything that I have here with her. She is the only person I feel I can claim I have had any significant sexual or romantic attraction to in my life. I have found that on occasion I will feel quite jealous of her body, in the sense that I wish I could be as beautiful and feminine as she is. And I think that, hypothetically, if I could have her body as my own, I would be absolutely happy to do so.\n\nI have tried wearing my girlfriends clothing (which she approves of) at times, but as she is very small and petite (5\'1"") and I am tall and lanky (6\'2"") I do not fit very well or at all in any of them. The best I\'ve done is some of her stockings which make my legs feel sexy.\n\nIn many instances I have said that I am comfortable with being a man, and that I wouldn\'t mind being a woman, and I think this is true to some degree. Some days I find myself looking in the mirror and being proud of my appearance and masculine features I have. On others, which are fewer, I find myself upset that I am not more feminine and wishing that I could be a woman.\n\nFor the record, I do not attempt to appear androgynous in any way. I have grown out facial hair and do not wear make up, which kind of brings me to what has recently been bothering me...\n\nI have always thought that makeup is unnecessary and I prefer when my girlfriend does not wear it, though she very rarely does anyway. However, recently on one of my \'wishful\' days, I shaved my facial hair off and secretly used my mother\'s makeup, wondering how I would look. I inevitably did a poor job of applying it but I found that I was overjoyed to see how feminine I looked and felt with it. After admitting the incident to my girlfriend, she happily offered to help me put on makeup and we had fun doing so together.\n\nI\'ve rambled on a lot about all of these things that muddle my thoughts about my gender identity, and I feel like it should be clear to me how I should identify, but it isn\'t. I\'ve never looked into LGBTQ communities, honestly, and I\'ve previously felt like I did not need to bother with labels or terms, but the more I think about it, the more I become frustrated that I just don\'t seem to know what to call myself. It makes me feel like I don\'t know what to say when I explain these things about myself to other people except weak phrases such as ""I\'m weird"" and ""I don\'t know"". I guess I wish I could safely say I was one thing or another, but I don\'t know enough to do so, and what I have read I feel like I can\'t relate to, which is strange. I feel like I\'m too ignorant and that using any labels to describe myself would somehow be insulting those people, like people who self-diagnose mental disorders when they truly are able-minded.\n\nAlready in this post I feel like I must have said a number of things to offend any amount of people, as much as I hope that I haven\'t. Perhaps I\'m being paranoid though. I\'m just terribly confused about what to call myself.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'I am feeling increasingly confused by how to describe myself', 'created': 1439898340.0}"

long story short:


back then: born female, somewhat heterosexual (as in: not feeling real sexual attraction but having crushes over and over), heavy social phobia and depression


later: transition started, identifying as gay (as in: still no sexual attraction, but still having crushes), depression is gone, but still feeling insecure in a lot of social situations.


now: post-op ftm, but identifying as no-gender and realizing I might be asexual. No signs of depression and I don't mind being around people anymore.

I'm a rather happy person now, I enjoy life, but I feel incredibly alone.

I've never been in a relationship, am still a virgin. I never really did care as I was too busy figuring out both my sexual and gender identity. 

Now, that I know who I am and what I want I start feeling like there's hardly anyone out there that might fit my preferences as well as I most likely won't fit anyones preferences.

I'm an asexual post-op ftm identifying as no-gender who is into guys but doesn't really identify as gay... and I live in a rather smallish town...

128,2015-08-20 10:55:07,3hpdkk,13,11,"""Before I start, sorry if this gets a little long, I figure the more back story to my situation the better.

I was born and raised male, and for the most part I have been ok with that, but I feel like I am just now realizing that a piece of me is missing. I understood from a young age that I am attracted to females, my first crush what when I was in kindergarten. Growing up I liked typical ""male"" things like playing in the dirt and building things with legos, but a tiny piece of me also like pretty thing. I wanted a Barbie, I had no idea why I just though she looked pretty, so I am pretty sure these feeling stretch far back even if I don't know why or remember them that well.

I was never bullied, for being girly at least, and for the most part I seemed like a typical boy. I don't know why or how but I started avoiding girly things because I thought they weren't meant for me. TV shows that had lots of female characters like, Cardcaptor Sakura, Sailor Moon and the Powerpuff Girls thrilled and enchanted me, yet I felt like I had to watch them in secret otherwise people would think I'm weird.

My senior year in high school was the first time I watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I loved it, everything about it. It was like a whole new world had opened up to me. I wouldn't say I was homophobic, I was always open minded and accepting, but gay things up until then had made me feel very uncomfortable. I felt more open and eventually discovered pornography of the transsexual genre.

A few years later, around age 18 or 19 I discovered the comedian Eddie Izzard. I have always loved comedy, and to see a successful male transvestite... made me think. By now I had, in some capacity, already thought about potential trans things and admitted to myself I was potentially bisexual(I had no idea what pansexual was back then, such ignorance).

I bought some panties to wear, not in connection to anything sexual just to feel pretty. I had tried a bit of eye shadow, and some lipstick and foundation but shopping over the internet was less than fruitful. I was discouraged by makeup, and lack of opportunity to use it seeing as how I was still living with parents. I felt, nervous in ladies underwear but at the same time so incredibly powerful.

I put those things away and locked that part of me up when I met my second (now ex)girlfriend. Well years later I reopened the door to that part of me when a (former because she is a crazy lair)friend came out as trans. Told me about how she hates her body and wants to be a guy. Turns out that was a lie to make her self sound more interesting than she really was, but it was enough to re-spark my interest in self discovery. I experimented with guys, and loved it.

With the help of my then girlfriend now fiancée I tired crossdressing. I never really went out in public but did so in the company of a few friends, with mixed results. Apparently I ""look great until you get to my face."" Aside from that, while it scared the crap out of me I loved it.

But, eventually I stopped because it was a lot of work to get all dressed up when I had no place to go. I would still paint my toes every once in a while but that was about it.

For that last year my fiancée and I have moved back in with my mother, we lost my stepfather to cancer and agreed to move back to help her out.

Well, I recently discovered the movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and the spark or self discovery has been relit yet again and it now burns brighter and hotter than ever and I am having an existential crises because I realize that even at the age of 26 I have no clue about who or what I am. The best labels I have found are pansexual, gender fluid and occasional crossdresser, but those feel like just words. They don't feel like they have meaning. And I feel lost in this scary nebulous world I don't understand. I feel like a man, and a women, and like someone who is both and something not quite described by either. I don't think surgery or hormone treatments would be right for me because those would just change what I am physically into something physically different. I know, realistically, being both sexes at the same time isn't possible. There is no surgery or hormone treatment to add the genitals I wasn't born with to what I already have to work with. I don't feel myself go into girl mode very often or very strongly, but this now feels like something beyond ""boy mode"" and ""girl mode.""

This new flair up has left my fiancée feeling uncertain about our future(fiancée does love and support me in this, it is just a bit of culture shock for her), and with my current living arrangement I feel I have no future to explore my true self. I am lost in a sea of pain, scared and confused by my total lack of self understanding.""

I understood from a young age that I am attracted to females, my first crush what when I was in kindergarten. Growing up I liked typical ""male"" things like playing in the dirt and building things with legos, but a tiny piece of me also like pretty thing. I wanted a Barbie, I had no idea why I just though she looked pretty, so I am pretty sure these feeling stretch far back even if I don\'t know why or remember them that well.\n\nI was never bullied, for being girly at least, and for the most part I seemed like a typical boy. I don\'t know why or how but I started avoiding girly things because I thought they weren\'t meant for me. TV shows that had lots of female characters like, Cardcaptor Sakura, Sailor Moon and the Powerpuff Girls thrilled and enchanted me, yet I felt like I had to watch them in secret otherwise people would think I\'m weird.\n\nMy senior year in high school was the first time I watch the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I loved it, everything about it. It was like a whole new world had opened up to me. I wouldn\'t say I was homophobic, I was always open minded and accepting, but gay things up until then had made me feel very uncomfortable. I felt more open and eventually discovered pornography of the transsexual genre.\n\nA few years later, around age 18 or 19 I discovered the comedian Eddie Izzard. I have always loved comedy, and to see a successful male transvestite... made me think. By now I had, in some capacity, already thought about potential trans things and admitted to myself I was potentially bisexual(I had no idea what pansexual was back then, such ignorance).\n\nI bought some panties to wear, not in connection to anything sexual just to feel pretty. I had tried a bit of eye shadow, and some lipstick and foundation but shopping over the internet was less than fruitful. I was discouraged by makeup, and lack of opportunity to use it seeing as how I was still living with parents. I felt, nervous in ladies underwear but at the same time so incredibly powerful.\n\nI put those things away and locked that part of me up when I met my second (now ex)girlfriend. Well years later I reopened the door to that part of me when a (former because she is a crazy lair)friend came out as trans. Told me about how she hates her body and wants to be a guy. Turns out that was a lie to make her self sound more interesting than she really was, but it was enough to re-spark my interest in self discovery. I experimented with guys, and loved it.\n\nWith the help of my then girlfriend now fiancée I tired crossdressing. I never really went out in public but did so in the company of a few friends, with mixed results. Apparently I ""look great until you get to my face."" Aside from that, while it scared the crap out of me I loved it.\n\nBut, eventually I stopped because it was a lot of work to get all dressed up when I had no place to go. I would still paint my toes every once in a while but that was about it.\n\nFor that last year my fiancée and I have moved back in with my mother, we lost my stepfather to cancer and agreed to move back to help her out.\n\nWell, I recently discovered the movie Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and the spark or self discovery has been relit yet again and it now burns brighter and hotter than ever and I am having an existential crises because I realize that even at the age of 26 I have no clue about who or what I am. The best labels I have found are pansexual, gender fluid and occasional crossdresser, but those feel like just words. They don\'t feel like they have meaning. And I feel lost in this scary nebulous world I don\'t understand. I feel like a man, and a women, and like someone who is both and something not quite described by either. I don\'t think surgery or hormone treatments would be right for me because those would just change what I am physically into something physically different. I know, realistically, being both sexes at the same time isn\'t possible. There is no surgery or hormone treatment to add the genitals I wasn\'t born with to what I already have to work with. I don\'t feel myself go into girl mode very often or very strongly, but this now feels like something beyond ""boy mode"" and ""girl mode.""\n\nThis new flair up has left my fiancée feeling uncertain about our future(fiancée does love and support me in this, it is just a bit of culture shock for her), and with my current living arrangement I feel I have no future to explore my true self. I am lost in a sea of pain, scared and confused by my total lack of self understanding.""\n\nI posted this about half a month ago and the only real advice I got(which is good advice) was to find a therapist.

- Stage One: Start telling close friends and trusted confidants one-on-one. I'm going to start the process in like mid-October (I'm Pagan, so Samhain (Halloween) has significance for me) and just take it slow. It may take me a few weeks, maybe longer (although I want to get to most people in this circle before the holidays, for obvious reasons). I'm going to ask them to keep it under their hats for the time being.

- Stage Two: Group hang-out with as many people in the aforementioned close friends circle as possible. I'm tentatively scheduling that for my birthday weekend (early March). A few days before then I'm going to do a bit of self care by treating myself to a salon day (mostly to get a rainbow swirl dye job I've wanted for a long while, but I'll also get a hair and beard trim) and picking up some makeup and nail polish. I'll show up with a more femme-y presentation and say, ""btw guys, it's okay to talk about this now.""

- Stage Three: Going public. Openly acknowledging, changing relevant info on social media, dealing with work, etc. (The last one will be weird because I freelance so there's no HR department to work with, which I guess means doing it on a client-by-client basis.)

I should say that there's already like 2 or 3 people who know, they're people I *deeply* trust and I told them a few months back because I was still in ""I'M SO CONFUSED SOMEBODY HALP"" mode and I needed to talk to *someone* about it. I call them my Alpha Testers. lol

So I think the part I'm struggling with most is the one-on-one convos. I'm trying to think of, like, an FAQ I can have in my head to respond to questions and I can't think of what I might be asked. (Other than ""are you sure?"", which I don't think will be asked but I'm working on a response just in case.) 

So, idk, what questions did people ask you when you came out? (Assuming you did come out, it's cool if you haven't!) What should I prepare for? Also, for a couple people in Stage One I had planned to tell them over coffee or brunch, but I'm not 100% sure if coming out in a public setting is a great idea and I'd like to hear your feedback on that.

147,2015-08-24 13:29:19,3i7769,1,17,"I am posting here to get input. I question maybe I am gender queer.  

I am told I am a handsome man.  I say gee thanks.  I have a hard time accepting that.  In my mind men who accept such things.  They are self centered and egotistical.

I think to myself.  It sure would be nice to be a woman.  In my mind, I would feel so much better.  I may never be them but I would be happier.

You know I lived as a woman.  I was born a boy.  I lived as a woman for 4 years.  Took E for about 5.  Developed breasts.  Become fem.  But more a Tomboy.  In the end you could say I was like a lesbian who was wearing denim shorts and T's.  Long hair and no or very little makeup.  I remember saying.  Wow you are not so fem after all.  You are more like the butch lesbians you admired.  I liked it.  Yet my genetic male body had feminized I felt like people would read me.

As time went on I felt like I was wrong.  As if I should not be here.  In the wee am hours I would go pee and sit and hear this thought or kind of voice in my head say ""I just don't know, I just don't know.""  What?  It sounded like my moms dad.  Where is this coming from?  Is this god?  Oh now whats going on?

Oh my god.  I then started thinking I was wrong for who I am.  For how I am living.  After all this society can be cruel some times.  When one doesn't have full passing privileges as a trans woman, they are at times on full on vigilance.  Who is it gonna be and are they gonna try to hurt me?  Sad huh?

I meet a Jehovahs witness.  Yay.  Not really.  I think maybe I am meant to go back and this person is a message to do just that.  I become a witness.  And yes I transition back.  Oh boy.  Oh no.  Wait.  Now they think I am gay or used to be gay and they treat me with homophobia.  Wait I am one of you.  But the male leadership.  Some of them don't treat me like one of the guys no matter what I do.  Oh no.  I feel betrayed.  All the things they told me.  They are not true.  I tried for almost a decade to prove myself.  To no avail.  I was a freak to some of the male leadership and would de treated this way as long as I am part of their faith.  It would follow me.  They network.  Sad.  I leave.

I am now back to living as a boy.

I had my breasts removed.  I have no testicles.

I am on T.  Masculinizing.  Hmm.  :/

I am now male.  Okay.  I pass okay.  Yet I don't feel male totally.  I try to live male.  I try to accept male.  Yet when I meet a woman as a male and she talks to me (as I am interpreting) like I am an egotistical walking erection I feel ashamed and I get upset.  I feel I am wrong for who I am.  I feel I am a bad person for being male.  I feel that if I was female I would be so much happier and fit in.  Yet my body now has issues. Health problems.  I struggle with my health.  I have lost over 100 pounds.  Wow.

If I could I would love to take E again.  I tried but got sick.  I cannot take T and E at the same time.  Coming off T is hard.  I have no gonads.  I feel stuck.

I wrote out on the white board in my therapist office.  Pre Trans woman.  Cutting, mutilation, attempts at amputation, masterbation and fantasizing being female, guilt, cross dressing and all other things that go along with trans.  

As a trans woman.  It all stopped.  Except wanting to be genetic female.  That was never gonna happen.

Wen I transitioned to being a boy.  Or a secondary trans male.  I developed a desire to be female again but not all the time.  I thought I could be happy as a boy.  Appreciate being boy.  In some ways I did, but I have a hard time accepting being stereotyped as a masculine man and treated like I am a walking erection or typical male.  I find it insulting.  It doesn't fit how I feel or who I want to be even as a male.  I get treated like I am expected to be a slob or a Neanderthal.  YUK!!  Stop please!  Ma'am I am not like that!  Please don't put me into that category.

I journal on my phone.  Identity now.  I make entries during the day.  Male, female or both.  Some male or some female.

It sucks.  There are two there.  I usually enter in the male name and the female name.

In some ways I like masculine.  It gets me privileges.  But in others I like the feminine.  It has things I love.  More than the masculine.  I like the fact that I can hide safely behind the male persona.  I won't get harassed.  But I prefer female.  At times, I wished I can be both.  Or androgynous.  Then choose.  Today I am...  Or I want to be this  ... today.  I want my breast back and want to look female.  And then again.  I enjoy the male presence as it is safe.  Yet I do not like the male role I feel men put me into when I am in their presence.  Competitive and talking about women in ways tat I find offensive.

Our brains seem to be programed in some way.  Our domestication, upbringing.  Society.  We are trained to think one or the other.  And even ourselves we struggle.  We know who we are yet we struggle thinking it has to be one or the other.  As if there is this Program or software virus saying no you have to be this or this.  You cant be both.  A primal brain thing.  I read some of your posts.  I wonder if our bodies are the issue.  Maybe out spark is one and the body is another.  Maybe we can have dual identity and they are separate yet bound to this reality?  Maybe it is reality that causes our confusion, reinforcing it constantly through visual and audible bombardment.  Maybe we struggle because we are a type of gender god in this society and we never really will fit in in our lifetime.  Even when we make efforts, in some way, we will still be our worse enemy.

I try to think.  I am a woman in a male survival suit with a PhD in masculinity.  Hmm.  :-/  Does that fit?  I think the jury is still out in that one.

Only thing is, they all think of me as a guy. Except for the two close friends I've come out to already, I haven't told anyone about the fact that I'm non-binary. And I'm not sure I should.

Let me say that I'm not worried about getting up in front of everyone and having to reveal this personal information; I did that back in June when I revealed I was depressed, and I was comfortable with it. What I am worried about is the following:

 * People will think I'm doing this to get attention

This is my biggest fear. I'm worried I might be making too big a show of it, that people might dismiss me or feel uncomfortable around me because I'll be ""the person that made a huge deal about coming out for nothing"".

 * I'll be shunned by the people I least expected it from.

This also worries me. There are some folks in my class I expect to react poorly, but I always figured I could cut the assholes out of my life. But lately I've been thinking that even some close friends may be assholes too.

 * Finally, I'm worried that I'm not ""lgbtq+"" enough

This is a big one. I spend a lot of time thinking ""What if it turns out I'm actually cis?"", or ""What if the fact that I don't identify with a gender doesn't warrant coming out?"" (see point #1)

FAAB, identify as Genderqueer, here who needs help choosing a Private Health Insurer that will hopefully cover getting top surgery in Australia. 

Have looked at a lot of insurers online and was hoping to see if I could get some feedback from fellow Aussies that had either had success doing the same through private health insurance or a heads up on ones to stay clear of.
I do know that I will probably need to get the highest level of cover available and be with the fund for a year before claiming already.

So any input or pointers on the subject would be much appreciated.

176,2015-08-30 10:18:07,3ixyb3,9,3,"Hi, I'm Hans. This year I discovered the term Non Binary and since then it's felt like a revelation. I've never really been female and yet it's all I've known, and now suddenly I've found this amazing term that just FITS me and my brain and everything makes sense.

I'm getting married on Saturday to the love of my life, my partner of nearly 7 years. I love him more than anything - he's my best friend and father of my child and everything to me. But lately I've been experiencing dysphoria tenfold. After speaking to docs they've agreed that's what it is.

I've spoken to my fiancé about my gender. At first he said it was just a phase and out of the blue but after I explained to him that I have always felt this way but unable to articulate it until now he understood. We have sorted out pronouns; after marriage I will be officially Mx M... (my name) with singular They. I'm happy with this. He's happy with this. All happy.

But I'm still going to be a bride. We are getting my dress on Tuesday. It's not a wedding dress as such, just a nice dress. But all I want to do at the moment is rip off my boobs and it's tearing me apart, because everyone is saying I'm going to be this beautiful bride and talking about wedding traditions and how the woman does this and the man does that, and my mum wants me to go dress shopping with her and pick out jewellery and I'm sat here thinking I can't do this. This is what women do. And I'm not a woman. I'm just me.

But 6 days before our wedding isn't the time to ""come out."" If I start correcting everybody who says I'm going to be ""Mrs F..."" it's just going to raise all these unnecessary questions.

Imagine you lived in a nation where everybody played football. 

On the day of its birth, every child is given a sticker on their forehead. If the child has five toes to a foot, it's given a green sticker. If the child has four toes to a foot, it's given an orange sticker.

As the children of this nation grow, they attend football school. Green students are told that as they mature, their bodies will develop sharkfin tattoos and a second row of teeth. Orange students are told that they will develop another pair of arms and single goat horn on the top of their head.

Both student groups are told that these developments are further proof that they belong as part of their respective, color-oriented teams.

The great majority of these students will grow to be fantastic football players, in love with their teams, and they will feel energized to know they are part of the greatest football team on earth. 

Some of these students will feel as if they belong on the other team. They will resent their shark tattoos and extra teeth, because both those features tell the world they play for the green team, when they really rather prefer orange.

A minority of these students will jump back and forth between teams. Some days they'll cram their extra arms under their shirts and play a game of football with the green team. Other days, they'll be proud to play with their comrades in the orange.

Hey all. Throwaway account for gender stuff, because this is something that has bothered me for at least a few years now.


I'm non-binary, afab, 21. Honestly I don't feel like my gender is impacted by my birth gender--so like, I'd be non-binary always regardless, and having the gender would feel the same even if dysphoria would be different. 


What gets me is that like... so obvs when trying to figure out how your gender&amp;dysphoria work, you often ""picture an ideal version of yourself"" right? And for me... like, I know this wording isn't great, but the best way I can find to phrase it is always like, ""my ideal version of me would be a non-op trans woman on HRT""?


Like I have pretty bad dysphoria over my hips and shoulders (or lack thereof) and hand and foot size, over my genitals (especially this, probably in part because I know there's No Fix atm), some over my chest (that's been getting worse, but it's Complicated tbh). My bone structure drives me nuts and made me want to die a lot over the past few months.


But skin and some things with body hair and less muscle mass and idk, I know this list sounds shorter but that's because I have many of those features already so I don't think about them so much, but just a lot of physically ""female"" traits and then, the ability to engage in ""girl"" things without judgement (which isn't related to/restricted by gender I know but still), is also a huge desire. 


It all kind of coalesces into me feeling like my physical body should be the 'opposite' and I should have been able to make modifications from there, instead of the other way around, where most modifications I can make via medicine/etc. just fuck shit up more and most of the things I need to change I can't. But I've never heard anyone else feel this way, so I was wondering if people do, or if it's just me? Like is it not just a ~weird nonbinary thing~ but actually just a ""weird me thing""?


The worst thing for me about this, outside of it just makes the dysphoria and anger worse, is it makes me irrationally jealous of a lot of my friends who are trans women. Like, I'm obviously friends with them just because I enjoy them as people and gender is secondary, but it doesn't mean if we're hanging out that I won't be struck with this really stupid mess of uncomfortable, jealous feelings like ""wow fuck you I want this I want that so badly please,"" and it is awful to feel that way about people I love (especially when they're talking about their transitions, which I should be thrilled for them for! but instead I'm just jealous?? in ways that don't even make sense since like, duh, I don't want spiro or e but my brain feels confused). I'm FWB with a girl right now who's trans and like, it's mostly chill and we talk a lot about gender and body shit re: both of us, but there are still moments I just get so stupidly jealous of her body (which feels even worse than just being jealous of other people because I know pretty intimately how awful that body is for her).


**tl;dr: I'm angry at myself for having the wrong body in a way that is not fixable, and also am jealous of people I care about. How do I deal with that/advice in general on this stuff?**

13,2015-08-07 02:59:24,3g33o8,20,7,"Hello peeps. I hope no one minds a wall of text. 

I'm a guy, if anyone asks me what gender/sex I am, I'll say straight away I'm a guy. I've always been like this. When I was a kid and for fun they dressed boys like girls in some events, just for some weird sort of fun. And I always hated it. I couldn't stand being looked at as a girl, it went against everything. I was a kid, with boy dreams, and boy everything.

When I hit puberty, things changed slightly: My sexuality obviously broke out, and with it some weird fantasies that clearly went against the norm of my gender, being submissive, weird kinks, having a rape fantasy (where I'm the victim). 

I didn't even think much of it, it didn't even cross my mind slightly that I could even be gay, I knew I was straight. 


And, guess what, things changed again: From 17 years my sexuality began to change once more, by change I'd say more stuff was added to it, nothing was discarded, but I gained some likes. I began to realize I always imagined myself as the girl while watching porn, or even just masturbating using the power of imagination. Obviously then I though the obvious, it was just a weird fetish. I looked it up and Ta daa, autogynephilia showed up and it perfectly described everything in my mind. Around this time I began having homossexual tendencies, I now had fixations with male genitalia. But not the male physique in general. I now consider myself as bisexual but that didn't come without some confusion of it's own.

So, now I'm 19, and for some months I began having thoughts of being a girl more than just sex. Being a girl in general, I still don't like make-up, female clothing (except panties). 

When I look into a mirror my feelings can only be described by cognitive dissonance. I look like a guy, I find myself hot, even though I'm probably not, and as 6' tall or 183 cm, non curvy body defined jawline and short hair, nothing about me says girly. When I look into the mirror I like what I see, I identify with that, but when I'm not looking into a mirror like a narcissist (you can tell by the hideously big post about myself) I think of myself as a girl, specially when I'm alone. It'd be a waste of my body changing to a girl specially considering as a trans I'd never look as good as I once did. I do feel like a guy these certain times, but most of the time when I'm alone reflecting I turn on girl mode.


I could go on talking about myself but I think this is enough. Am I bit genderfluid? Does one need to be born this way, when this is only a recent thing? Am I making shit up? I feel like I'm a poser compared to most real people here.

Also, my sister came out as non-binary, probably not relevant, but since we share alot of genes it could be I was aswell...

I'm a late 20's bio male. I experimented with guys sexually in my teens but decided it wasn't for me. Growing up, and even now, I would describe myself as somewhat eccentric. Overall, I'm a fairly masculine guy, lift weights, like sports, hunting, fishing, etc. However, I've always felt like i had this feminine side to me. I've always been jealous of the awesome clothes women get to wear, as well as the different hairstyles. Fashion wise, I mainly wear regular guy clothes, but some of the higher quality pieces in my wardrobe def have a bit of an androgynous flair. My speech can vary between masculine and feminine patterns. In video games, if a female character was an option, I would always choose it, and not in a sexual manner, I have just always preferred playing as female characters. With TV shows, I feel like I generally prefer strong female leads. Also did some minor cross dressing when I was a kid, but nothing post puberty. I've always chalked this up to just getting a higher hit of estrogen in the womb than most of my male peers.

Anyways, I just found out that my biological father, who died when I was young, was transsexual. Bit of a mindfuck to find that out to say the least. So I start to think that maybe this explains my feminine quirks, so I start reading about it. Read that transsexualism has something like a 62% heritability. Now, I'm not transsexual. I'm quite happy with my genitals the way they are, but all this reading led to to the idea of genderfluidity, which kind of seems like it fits. 

So while I definitely generally identify as a man, and I don't necessarily identify as a woman, I don't not identify as a woman either. Then I read an article like this: http://nonbinary.org/wiki/Genderfluid and I'm even more confused and like wtf. Furthermore, I have a lot of gay friends (no trans friends though), and it seems like this maybe would have come up before, but it didn't til I found out about my father.

About a year and a half ago, I came out as bisexual, and after I became comfortable with myself for that, I felt very accepted and open about it.

So what I really want to ask is: Is any of this weird? Like, I do genuinely feel like a guy sometimes, and a girl other times, but whenever those feelings get strong, I question if I'm just cis/trans. I'd be okay if I was either, but I feel like I'm just naturally stuck in the dysphoric, awkward, middle.

So I'm 21 and I'd like to think I'm pansexual, with a preference for men but I've only been involved with one girl so I wouldnt have enough experience to know for sure I guess... I'm biologically female (obviously) but this week diagnosed with gender identity disorder. So I can't say I'm trans yet because I am still figuring out wtf to do with myself. I've thought of myself as male as young as five years old, but I've always tried to focus on the good aspects of being female so I don't have to deal with the natural discomfort of wanting to be male. And I've done this to as keep the interest of men, who like I said, are my primary interest.

I'm currently in a relationship with a straight guy who I feel is the love of my life. He's the kind of partner I've always dreamed about. He's very sweet natured, good listener, smart, and goofy. We've been together about 8 months. But he is completely heterosexual. &amp; I think it is this that is subconsciously holding me back from moving more into who I really am. He's told me he'd be fine with me dressing as male but that calling me his BF would be uncomfortable. He still very often slips up on calling me by male pronouns, though I know he tries because he corrects himself. He explains that it's because I still look like a woman and I have a feminine personality that it's hard for him to think of me as male. I figured this would be a great place to get some advice from people who may have been in the same boat?

But as long as I can remember I've felt at times just...wrong. Like I was meant to be a boy. There's something screaming in my head ""you ARE a boy."" The earliest I can remember was having really bad anxiety and crying at the age of 6 because I would never be a boy.

 I grew up obsessed with video games and have always (read: almost 100% of the time) felt at ease with male characters. I played zelda throughout my childhood because whenever I was having a bad day, I could always be a heroic male character while playing. This continued with every single video game. I'd pick the male characters and deep in my gut I'd feel like ""that's me."" I can only recall one game where I prefered the female character. This is really embarrassing, but when I was like 12 I would force my friends to let me be all the male characters during role play. It just felt like the slot I could fit in, like I'd be able to tap into this side of me that's, well, a boy. It's small, but it's alive, and it hasn't gone away no matter how much I want it to.

Now that I'm older, when I'm comfortable with my gender, I'm 100% comfortable. I'll think to myself, ""wow that was a weird phase, I am definitely cis. Glad I figured that out."" And there are times when I feel uncomfortable with my breasts and long hair and I feel....I guess this feeling of intense worry or discomfort. And today I stood in front of the mirror when I felt like this and fixed my hair so that it looked short, like a boy's. It felt right. Like relief. When people call me ""he"" over the Internet i feel happy. But when I feel this way I still love girly shit, like soft colors, dresses, am okay with being called she, all that stuff. And when I stop feeling like that even a little I feel like a fake or like I was making it up for attention, even though I've never told anyone but my best friend (a week later I heavily backpedaled and said I was just into cross dressing). For some reason I don't feel comfortable being called a man, or calling myself manly (ie: bodybuilder guy or hairy chest), but feel kinda like a feminine-ish boy. Sometimes I'll think a guy is cute and stop myself, thinking ""I'm not gay"", but that just confuses me more because I'm not a boy, right?

But most of the time, I feel like a girl. But it feels like the boy side has just gone into hiding and will be back. Even with all of this, I keep trying to convince myself that gender fluidity isn't real, that I'm just expirementing, that I'm faking it... I'll say this to myself as I cry myself to sleep because I'll never be a boy. I just want to be normal...

Actually, the title is a little too vague, of course, if you want to help you need some information about me, my father, and other thing !

Now, why not just said it to him ? Pretty simple, he's homophobic ( and of course transphobic ) and I know he will rage when he will learn ( but I don't fear him ). 

I asked some advice from my mother, and she think it's not a good idea and I will just “hurt him”, but on the other side I think “if he can't be happy for his children, it's not my fault” and I want him to know, because it's really an important thing in my life.

My dsyphoria is centered around my body. I wish for a more feminine figure, but not breasts and I don't desire SRS. Of course, this kind of thing is impossible to achieve because of the way hormones work. As you probably know, the only real way to get a feminine figure is from estrogen and anti-androgens. I really don't want to do this treatment because it will cause breast growth and royally screw up my sexual function. I'm straight and want to be able to top women, so that's why the latter is a big deal. I don't want/can't have this treatment. 

I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that there is no treatment available that will work for me and that I'm never going to be able to be the person I want to be. It's a really hard pill to swallow and I'm having a very difficult time with it. Depression, anxiety and panic attacks, etc. Not all the time thankfully, but certainly on the days when I have a craving for a feminine appearance. 

Obviously there are, and continue to be, some days where it's a lot easier deal with. However there still are/will be awful days. Like today, for example. As I write this I'm feeling really depressed and want to cry. And of course this will be something that will be easier with time, but I don't want to wait.

Just wanted to intriduce myself to this reddit. At this point I am identifying as genderfluid although I am super confused with all of the terminology I am learning. I considered myself a cross dresser since I was a small child but have always known there was more to it. Sometimes I wished I would wake up a girl and ive always had those fantasies. As I have accepted myself and I am learning what I am I realized I have days where I am fine being male but others where I wish I was female. I usually dress femme and keep my facial hair with makeup and I feel most comfortable like that.

36,2015-08-21 08:06:16,3htpc8,16,2,"So I just recently came to terms that I actually am genderfluid (fluidflux?). For the past few months identifying as non-binary, I knew that I was a bit fluid, but I thought that I was mostly just neutral enough that it was a non-issue, and that I could just ignore the slight fluctuations, do what made me comfortable and things wouldn't have to change.

I am mostly a very low-risk, mostly-static individual, and the fact that my gender changes is actually kind of distressing to me. Mostly because my dysphoria changes with it, along with my conception of my body, and self-image and I have to adapt. I have to come up with new coping mechanisms, which is hard, as I'd like to have stability and reliability in my life and how I experience things.

I come from a white conservative christian background, (so uh, warning, for internalized transphobia or whatever) and I still consider myself christian, so when reconciling this to my beliefs, I only want to except scientific biological kind of stuff as the basis for this. Not psychological stuff that I could 'resolve', or at least address somehow. (This is not targeted at anyone else, only myself, as I'm uniquely positioned to understand my own experiences and their effect, but not really anybody else's.)

I have formed and refined a rather complex theory on how my brain developed in terms of my gender and to a far lesser extent, my orientation (which is asexual):

1) According to what I understand of [this paper focusing on the development of sexual attraction,](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/Michael.Berger/lit/McClintock.pdf) the maturation of adrenal glands between 6-11 year-old children (roughly averaging around the time people are in 4th grade), leads to a release in almost identical amount of androgens in either sex (although this study omits mention of intersex children, so it may be different in their case). The author of this paper writes that ""[the 10-fold] increase in androgen levels alters the brain, and thus behavior, either by modifying neural function or by permanently altering cellular structure.""

I believe that during this time, my body or hormones did not perform the function observed in the above paper as they were supposed to, if at all. Although the only evidence I have for this is that I never in my life have experienced sexual attraction, and that around this time and onward, I had developed a increasingly divergent experiences and behavior than that of my peers. I believe that however my body experienced adrenarche differently, it obviously effected my brain development orientation-wise, and most probably my perception of my body-map, and thus ultimately my perception of my gender and self-image.

2) At gonadarche, or what is commonly thought to be the beginning of puberty, the brain is reshaped some more. Certain processes change under the influence of adrenal stress hormones, growth hormones, and sex hormones until the early 20s. I believe my biology continued to act atypically both in what is common for most adolescents in that stage, though slightly less so in ways that were common for my sex (female, I'm afab).

My evidence is as follows: I did go through puberty, (I have a very loose conception of what puberty involves, as no one ever really talked about it with me, and I am pretty much repulsed by the realities of anatomy. I also never took any form of sex-ed, so... uh, I may get some of this wrong.) and got my period just before Christmas vacation in 6th grade (I thought I was dying from kidney failure or something, I had no idea what a period was). Um. So for the first year or so, I had my period for around every 3 months, then for one year or so I had it about every month, then the next half-year I had it every 3-5 months or so, and then for most of high school until today, (I am currently 20, around 3 years out of highschool) I've had it once or twice every year or two, so basically I don't really have to deal with it (yay!).

Since my period is probably the most reliable indicator as to whether the right kind or amount of hormones are present or not, I think this is pretty good evidence that hormonally, I have been different, except for a small amount of time, from others of my sex. (I'm choosing to ignore growth hormone in this case, as I believe it has functioned normally during my body's maturation.) I also had my hormones tested once, during high-school, from an unrelated medical scare, and it seems that I have extremely low levels of both estrogen and progesterone, although they seem to be balanced with each other. Which probably explains why I've always been the most emotionally stable, devoid of drama, person in the room at any give time during highschool.

3) I have no idea if my natal brain formed differently , as I was not self-aware (obviously). I have not really studied how one may judge how one's brain maybe formed differently at birth anyway, so I can't speculate.

**TLDR; In conclusion, I believe that since my biology and hormones behaved differently during key times of my brain's formation and development, that even if one were to give me a standard amount of female hormones now, it would not change my body-map or gender identity, although it would alter my body's function (to align better with most cis-females) and possibly certain mental processes (though I believe it would in much the way that a bad code would effect a program, not well, glitchy).**

Also, since I realized that I haven't explained it before, I understand myself as having a body-map, which is different than, but informs, my self image and gender.

The body map is one's self-representation of one's own body, so my body-map when I'm female, is actually that of a non-puberty affected female though aged-up to my actual age, but this basically means no secondary sexual characteristics like no breasts, and not really functioning, um, plumbing and definitely no periods. Which sounds really weird or creepy or disturbing whenever I describe it, but, that's what it is. It's basically the same as when I'm a guy, though a slightly deeper more resonant voice, with more developed muscles of an adult, and with functioning plumbing, at least a prostate and phallus, but oddly enough, I don't miss having testes. The majority of the time though, I'm neutral, physically genderless, no sexual characteristics what-so-ever, if I had my way, I would eliminate all waste from the same source, like a bird. And there are more differences, but those pertain to what my body actually would be perceived as if my body matched my gender, what it seems to be in those moments.

What's really baffling me though, is differences that occur when experiencing different genders. Things that kind of seem stereotypical, or not related to sex:

Like, when I'm female, red seems to be more present, like more vivid, more noticeable and intense in some indefinable way, (I also seem to hate red, maybe because it's kind of grating to look at, when I'm female) does anyone else experience this? Seeing red more?

Also, and this seems stereotypical, but when female, chocolate seems much more satisfying. Not like I crave it more, but that it tastes deeper, just like it reaches down and feels more. It's more satisfying, I can't explain it. I also seem to like fresher, more 'healthy' vegetarian type food when I'm female, and some of my favorite foods when I'm other genders, I ignore because it's too greasy, or creamy or or something. (Although, while I don't really care for ice-cream when female, there is an amazing gelato place I know with astoundingly fresh flavors that I like.)

While neutral gender, I actually like red, and I like a lot of orange, or orange -analogous colors, and red isn't really that noticeable, just another color. I also like salty, fatty, savory, meaty, and creamy foods more when I'm neutral gender, like sharp cheeses, beef-fried rice, cheesecake, quiche, ice-cream, or fried eggs. I also really really really like cherries. I don't care for them when female, but when neutral, I can't get enough of them.

I seem to also only interested in cosmetics and scents while male or sometimes when neutral, but never when female; albiet only ones designed for men or unisex use (4voo, Anthony, Escentric Essences). Also I've only experienced arousal in male mode. I'm still asexual, I just get, um, blue balls (apparently vasoconstriction in afab bodies is a thing) because I have a stupid directionless libido that I can't even satisfy if I wanted to because that appendage doesn't exist on my body. Talk about frustrating.

On top of all this, I can be masculine, neutral, or feminine on top of my base gender. Which while even more confusing, (I KNOW I could never verbally explain all this) I just try to roll with it. And then there are just my basic behaviors and desires that are just part of my wonderfully smart, genuine, caring and quirky personality, that throws people at first but like once they get to know me it works triple-time to endear me to them.

All of this just is so complex, and confusing, and equally nice, because I'm finding that I enjoy things more, and take care of myself more, and I've realized, that while overweight, I'm not actually a slovenly slob obese person that looks ugly, and that I clean up quite nicely, I look pretty darn sharp or beautiful when I know how to see myself. Which is awesome! I actually really really like myself. 

But. All those that I love, if they knew would at best view me as, confused or deceived or threatening or mentally ill, and though it really tears me up inside, I understand why, a lot of times I get their opinion and I think I am too. Although my zucchini (ace relationships are freaking awesome) knows, and she's a conservative christian like I am, but she believes me! But it comes with qualifications, like not medically transitioning (which, I for the most part agree with, because I'm almost pathologically averse to modifying my body in any way, like even short term cosmetic stuff.) But what if my body decides to up it's hormones and I get periods? There is just something fundamentally wrong with that as a function of my body no matter what gender I am. Same with having boobs, though I'm more or less at peace with them. And she thinks that even though I experience gender differently, that since my birth sex is still a reality, how I was born... well, there's a lot of issues I have to work through in how they seemingly conflict with my beliefs and she shares a great deal of my beliefs. That's all I'll say for now on that as this is a gender sub, not a faith sub. Sorry :\

I realize that the reason I place so much emphasis about the biological reality behind my gender, my 'brain sex' is probably because that is the only way those around, me, those I love might be able to accept it, if they knew. Maybe it's the only way I can accept myself. I really hope I'm not making you folks feel bad. I just - this is one of the most difficult things I've had to deal with my whole life.

So I guess I just needed to get a lot of this off my chest, all this kind of stuff throws me for a loop, and I'd really like to hear your opinions and experiences.

37,2015-08-21 14:08:54,3hummy,10,2,"My GF/Fiancé (or however it's spelled) has recently told me that she's gender fluid. It seemed like a really big deal to her and she was afraid that I wouldn't want to be with her anymore. I'm a straight guy, who is pretty open minded as far as those things go. She told me that it means that in her mind, on certain days she might feel like a girl or a boy, it kinda caught me off guard, and I didnt really know what to think. I know that she is attracted to both sexes, and that BPD often goes along with gender confusion.

I love her and I will still love her the same no matter how she's feeling, but it's very confusing to me how she could feel like a boy... I mean she dresses very tomboyish at times and girly others. But she doesnt act any different and is still a woman to me. I mean no offense by saying that, but I'm straight and it's very confusing to me. I dont want to hurt her feelings by not understanding and I want to make her happy, so if someone could give me a good understanding of what this means I'd really appreciate it...

1. Would this feminize my body? And if so, would the amount I would need to take be safe?
2. If so, would the amount I would need to take lower my T levels on it's own? In other words, would the hormones compete for dominance? Is it a ""this town aint big enough for the two of us"" type situation?
3. Or rather, would the two hormones co-exist?

Also, that there would be exactly enough testosterone to keep my sex organs working meanwhile the estrogen altered the rest of my body. Is this a realistic hope?

I know I've got years ahead of me to figure it all out, but every now and again I think about it and it eats away at me for a few days until I can forget about it again. 

I'm a heavy tumblr user, so already there's a lot of influence from part of the community to grab at labels to make myself seem more interesting. I know for sure that I'm pansexual; my parents are aware that I'm in a relationship with a girl and nothing else. They're not homophobic, but they almost never talk about it and still sometimes refer to my girlfriend as just my friend. I'm fine with that; it's just not that big of a deal.

I knew what gender fluidity was from tumblr but never made the connection between that and my feelings until a few months ago. I'd stay up in my room late at night to bind my breasts with sports bras, wear my most boyish clothing, and hide my hair with a hat. I'd look in the mirror and be happy with what I saw. I still don't know if that means I was male in those moments, but I think he/him pronouns would have suited me better then. This only started a few months ago but it alleviated some kind of stress I didn't even know existed up until then.

When I figured out I might be genderfluid, I let the thought sit in the back of my mind for a few days before I really addressed it. I asked my mom in the car if it was alright to question my gender identity, and she gave me a speech about how I didn't even know what gender was at my age, how I shouldn't be focusing on that (and that I should be focusing more on school instead), and that I just wanted to have a quirky new label so I could be cool. If that's the case, how do people know they're trans so early? I hadn't even mentioned any specific labels. I was really hurt by her reaction and never brought it up again, but I've made a point to browse the men's clothing as well as lady's clothing at stores since then. My mom has noticed but never stopped me.

Back to present: I've been fighting with myself constantly. There's a possibility my mom is right and that I am looking for attention, but that doesn't explain why I only ""dress up"" in private and haven't told anyone. Do I just want to be a part of something new and exciting, like getting a piercing or dyeing your hair? Or am I really something other than cis? Most times I never give my gender a second thought and am simply myself, but others I lie awake in bed at night trying to make sense of it all. Sort of like right now. I feel like if I'm binding my chest and want to be referred to as a he even if only once a week or so, then there's no way I can be 100% cis. But who knows whether or not it's all just in my head because I want to be different? 

All these questions bother me for a few days once every month or so and then I can forget about them again. I know I only have a few more years while I live in this house but it seems like an eternity if I can't experiment with my identity and figure myself out. I don't want to jump to conclusions, either.
