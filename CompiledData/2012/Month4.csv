New creatures

Blister and slither

Beholden unto nothing

New Creatures are Born


The infallibility of infancy

The quiet decay of another day

Erupting forth from graveyard wombs

New Creatures come out at night


Bent and beautifully twisted

Wrapping around long spindles

They collapse and relapse

Well rehearsed decimation


Unnatural alien masses

Beautiful wild and lustful

Shrilly screaming triumphantly

As they murder the dawn

The New Creatures are coming


The gibbering mob crescendos

Spilling out unstoppable

Looting dirty looks and spit

Ravaging small bruised towns

Fucking on park benches

Glorious monsters rise


They sleep together now

huddled little horrors

In abandoned cars and mouldering cathedrals

Incubating abomination babies

Waiting to claim this world as their own



The New Creatures are here

So, 1 week ago I was at a presentation which was sort of a LGBTQ awareness thing, which is where I first heard the term ""genderqueer"". The definition was very brief and barely covered, but it stuck in my mind. It was mandatory for a psychology class, and I wasn't really paying attention (I have always been supportive and understanding toward LGBT community having known a few couples an individuals growing up) but that word sort of shocked me in a way.

Previously I had thought that I was bisexual with a strong female preference which in my mind was well in the confines of ""average"". A couple things have gotten me thinking, one was a dream about being a woman, and the other was a catalyst which occurred last night (Not sure I feel comfortable talking about it right now). So all of this got me thinking about my past and doing some reading.

Some things came up that have gotten me quite confused about my identity. I have always had sort of a fascination with strong female characters from different shows and movies. One in particular is really messing with me because I had never thought about it from this perspective before is Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell. She is what is known as ""full prosthetic"" she is a cyborg female who was at one point a male human. (Yea thinking about that never occurred to me before)

I now realize I have had some thoughts about this in the past but they didn't really have any meaning until now.

Beyond that I'm not sure I have ever fit into the binary gender system. I realize now I have always been seeking an intimate relationship and not a sexual one, something that could be described as feminine. Not too long ago a conversation with a few male friends somehow ended up on the topic of looking up girl's skirts during our highschool years, and my response was something along the lines of ""I never did that, its disrespectful"". I was mocked for it, and I was a bit confused. I have never been interested in a lot of things that would be considered ""manly"" like hunting, fishing, sports, cars, etc, and but also not interested in a lot of ""womanly"" things. My interests are largely ""gender neutral"" like talking, video games, movies, and music.

I think I have always been rather introverted possibly because I have never accepted myself. From this point I don't really know where to go. I think I am comfortable with my body. I don't feel like a woman, but at I think I would have rather been born a woman and lived almost the same lifestyle (even if it meant being a lesbian) which confuses the hell out of me.

What I probably need most is someone to talk to. Even writing this has been rather therapeutic for me. So, in short, I don't know how to describe myself, but it probably involves genderqueer.

(There are probably errors everywhere, I have been sitting around adding and removing things being somewhat afraid to post.)

Edit: You know what? I am just going to say what the other catalyst was. Last night I stumbled across a very long (and unfinished) comic/graphic novel about a college aged boy who would spontaneously changed sex based off of his emotional state and it is about his struggles to accept his feminine side and his forming of a lasting intimate relationship with a lesbian.

I would also like to try low dose HRT (M to F), but am having a hard time finding information. I am hoping there are at least a few people here who may have tried low dose HRT. I will appreciate if you can help me with answers for a few questions.

1. What dosage constitutes low dose HRT ?
2. I have heard people say that taking a little Estrogen might get the body to produce more Testosterone. However, I have also read that the mechanism that produces LH which regulates production of T, cannot distinguish between T and E. So a lititle increase in E should at least theoretically decrease T production.
3. Does Dutesteride effect mental cognition (I have read this on a few hair loss forums) ?
4. Is it possible to go all natural if low dose HRT is all I want ? What is your opinion of the following regimen (Licorice + Spearmint Tea + Tofu + Soy Milk)
5. What kind of physical and psychological changes can I expect from low dose HRT ?
6. Are the risks of blood clotting also low when taking low dose HRT, or are the risks still comparable to regular dosages ?
7. If you are already in low dose HRT, can you please share your dosage details ?

I've posted other poems that are more specifically trans, but this one just feels like my battlecry when I want everything (to retain my marriage, embrace my femininity, and balk gender stereotypes), even when ""everything"" is maybe far more than reality is willing to offer. Hope you like it.  

    I am the faceless warrior, prefer do I this mask.  
    No needs for names or gender, things metal will outlast.  
    And if armor’s overused, even moreso as a symbol,  
    At least inspect the contours, a work of hands that tremble.  

    The body and the bulk, perhaps dismissed in jest,  
    Proudly serve my purpose; no more pieces to divest!  
    Ornate lines and flourish, engravings deep and bold,  
    These frame true my dignity, my burden still untold.  

    Mark me son or daughter (or cast me in between).  
    Distinction dulls in time, blade edgeless without sheen.  
    So few will pierce this suit, perhaps not more than one,  
    Lodged into its plating, a sword to twist and plunge.  

    But should the wielder loose their grip and strain to hear a sound,  
    A rhythmic clang of metal through its hollows may rebound.  
    For long has armor clung to flesh (or something out of reach);  
    And long has face been hidden, both their warmth and power leached.  

    Again I light the fire, crouching close and without fear.  
    Enveloped now in waves, soothing hope I must endear.  
    And for a time this metal glistens, reflecting all but shame,  
    Absorbing what it can, bending softly to the flame.  

    Is all such passion so produced, borne from one hot fire,  
    No other thoughts, no other dreams, no myriad desires?  
    Will the burning blaze return or settle down to rubble?  
    Will I kindle what remains or seize from endless struggle?  

    For if the blade embedded once could carry me thus far,  
    What might its master and I wield to further such a scar?  
    Could we crack this armored shell and rupture all the seals;  
    Expose the underneath but leave intact its metal peel?  

    Then might we try to reach beyond a site so neatly laid,  
    To find our warmth from other means not readily displayed,  
    To move beneath an empty sky, points of reference gone,  
    Journey through an undone land, protectors all withdrawn.  

    And pass would we the bends that wind to places barred from view,  
    Trudging forward, each solid step might seem like life renewed.  
    But we’d walk in solitude, past roads all marked with care,  
    Not to green and blossomed fields, to snow swept planes we’d dare.

I like my male body. If I was female, I'd probably like my body just as much, but my history is as male so that is what I am familiar with and prefer. So I confidently say that my physical gender identity is male, with the acceptance that this is my personal preference and that there is nothing *inherently* worse about being female-bodied.

However, it is everything else about being male that I have a problem with. I cannot accept gender roles, male privilege, the patriarchy, etc. The thought that the gender I identify with is responsible for such oppression of women and sexual minorities fills me with shame and frustration. Even more so than how I dislike the pressures associated with the social construction of masculinity, I feel guilt about the social pressures and discrimination I avoided by being born male instead of female. 

It bothers me that I am so opposed to the social connotations, privileges, and implications of being male but feel powerless to express this to others. I just want to be able to wash my hands of it, and say that although I am physically male, I reject the social gender identity that goes with it. Is it wrong to want this? Is achieving this impossible?

So I confidently say that my physical gender identity is male, with the acceptance that this is my personal preference and that there is nothing *inherently* worse about being female-bodied.\n\nHowever, it is everything else about being male that I have a problem with. I cannot accept gender roles, male privilege, the patriarchy, etc. The thought that the gender I identify with is responsible for such oppression of women and sexual minorities fills me with shame and frustration. Even more so than how I dislike the pressures associated with the social construction of masculinity, I feel guilt about the social pressures and discrimination I avoided by being born male instead of female. \n\nIt bothers me that I am so opposed to the social connotations, privileges, and implications of being male but feel powerless to express this to others. I just want to be able to wash my hands of it, and say that although I am physically male, I reject the social gender identity that goes with it. Is it wrong to want this? Is achieving this impossible?\n\nUpdate (4/13/2012): [Introducing r/MaleFemme](http://redd.it/s7zk2) "", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Conflicting Physical and Social Gender Identity', 'created': 1333927196.0}",12.0

New creatures

Blister and slither

Beholden unto nothing

New Creatures are Born


The infallibility of infancy

The quiet decay of another day

Erupting forth from graveyard wombs

New Creatures come out at night


Bent and beautifully twisted

Wrapping around long spindles

They collapse and relapse

Well rehearsed decimation


Unnatural alien masses

Beautiful wild and lustful

Shrilly screaming triumphantly

As they murder the dawn

The New Creatures are coming


The gibbering mob crescendos

Spilling out unstoppable

Looting dirty looks and spit

Ravaging small bruised towns

Fucking on park benches

Glorious monsters rise


They sleep together now

huddled little horrors

In abandoned cars and mouldering cathedrals

Incubating abomination babies

Waiting to claim this world as their own



The New Creatures are here

41,2012-04-27 21:43:32,svxgl,3,8,"Let's start off by saying I am a biological male whose sexual preference is female. I am not at the point where I would be comfortable talking to people in real life about this issue yet.

So, 1 week ago I was at a presentation which was sort of a LGBTQ awareness thing, which is where I first heard the term ""genderqueer"". The definition was very brief and barely covered, but it stuck in my mind. It was mandatory for a psychology class, and I wasn't really paying attention (I have always been supportive and understanding toward LGBT community having known a few couples an individuals growing up) but that word sort of shocked me in a way.

Previously I had thought that I was bisexual with a strong female preference which in my mind was well in the confines of ""average"". A couple things have gotten me thinking, one was a dream about being a woman, and the other was a catalyst which occurred last night (Not sure I feel comfortable talking about it right now). So all of this got me thinking about my past and doing some reading.

Some things came up that have gotten me quite confused about my identity. I have always had sort of a fascination with strong female characters from different shows and movies. One in particular is really messing with me because I had never thought about it from this perspective before is Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell. She is what is known as ""full prosthetic"" she is a cyborg female who was at one point a male human. (Yea thinking about that never occurred to me before)

I now realize I have had some thoughts about this in the past but they didn't really have any meaning until now.

Beyond that I'm not sure I have ever fit into the binary gender system. I realize now I have always been seeking an intimate relationship and not a sexual one, something that could be described as feminine. Not too long ago a conversation with a few male friends somehow ended up on the topic of looking up girl's skirts during our highschool years, and my response was something along the lines of ""I never did that, its disrespectful"". I was mocked for it, and I was a bit confused. I have never been interested in a lot of things that would be considered ""manly"" like hunting, fishing, sports, cars, etc, and but also not interested in a lot of ""womanly"" things. My interests are largely ""gender neutral"" like talking, video games, movies, and music.

I think I have always been rather introverted possibly because I have never accepted myself. From this point I don't really know where to go. I think I am comfortable with my body. I don't feel like a woman, but at I think I would have rather been born a woman and lived almost the same lifestyle (even if it meant being a lesbian) which confuses the hell out of me.

What I probably need most is someone to talk to. Even writing this has been rather therapeutic for me. So, in short, I don't know how to describe myself, but it probably involves genderqueer.

(There are probably errors everywhere, I have been sitting around adding and removing things being somewhat afraid to post.)

Edit: You know what? I am just going to say what the other catalyst was. Last night I stumbled across a very long (and unfinished) comic/graphic novel about a college aged boy who would spontaneously changed sex based off of his emotional state and it is about his struggles to accept his feminine side and his forming of a lasting intimate relationship with a lesbian. The reason I didn't want to mention it was first off all, I found it on 4chan, and second of all it was somewhat pornographic in nature.

New creatures

Blister and slither
Beholden unto nothing
New Creatures are Born

The infallibility of infancy
The quiet decay of another day
Erupting forth from graveyard wombs
New Creatures come out at night

Bent and beautifully twisted
Wrapping around long spindles 
They collapse and relapse
Well rehearsed decimation

Unnatural alien masses
Beautiful wild and lustful
Shrilly screaming triumphantly
As they murder the dawn
The New Creatures are coming

The gibbering mob crescendos
Spilling out unstoppable 
Looting dirty looks and spit
Ravaging small bruised towns
Fucking on park benches
Glorious monsters rise

They sleep together now
huddled little horrors
In abandoned cars and mouldering cathedrals
Incubating abomination babies
Waiting to claim this world as their own

I identify as non binary, born male with a soul that's mostly feminine and kind of masculine also :-) I am in the process of making small changes like growing out my hair, shaving body hair, etc to bring myself closer to the gender I feel.

I would also like to try low dose HRT (M to F), but am having a hard time finding information. I am hoping there are at least a few people here who may have tried low dose HRT. I will appreciate if you can help me with answers for a few questions.

1. What dosage constitutes low dose HRT ?
2. I have heard people say that taking a little Estrogen might get the body to produce more Testosterone. However, I have also read that the mechanism that produces LH which regulates production of T, cannot distinguish between T and E. So a lititle increase in E should at least theoretically decrease T production.
3. Does Dutesteride effect mental cognition (I have read this on a few hair loss forums) ?
4. Is it possible to go all natural if low dose HRT is all I want ? What is your opinion of the following regimen (Licorice + Spearmint Tea + Tofu + Soy Milk)
5. What kind of physical and psychological changes can I expect from low dose HRT ?
6. Are the risks of blood clotting also low when taking low dose HRT, or are the risks still comparable to regular dosages ?
7. If you are already in low dose HRT, can you please share your dosage details ?

46,2012-04-30 02:13:26,sz2x9,2,11,"I finished this about a week ago, and while I should probably stick to bothering /r/poetry with stuff like this, I feel it really resonates with what so many of us talk about or read here.  I've posted other poems that are more specifically trans, but this one just feels like my battlecry when I want everything (to retain my marriage, embrace my femininity, and balk gender stereotypes), even when ""everything"" is maybe far more than reality is willing to offer. Hope you like it.  

    I am the faceless warrior, prefer do I this mask.  
    No needs for names or gender, things metal will outlast.  
    And if armor’s overused, even moreso as a symbol,  
    At least inspect the contours, a work of hands that tremble.  

    The body and the bulk, perhaps dismissed in jest,  
    Proudly serve my purpose; no more pieces to divest!  
    Ornate lines and flourish, engravings deep and bold,  
    These frame true my dignity, my burden still untold.  

    Mark me son or daughter (or cast me in between).  
    Distinction dulls in time, blade edgeless without sheen.  
    So few will pierce this suit, perhaps not more than one,  
    Lodged into its plating, a sword to twist and plunge.  

    But should the wielder loose their grip and strain to hear a sound,  
    A rhythmic clang of metal through its hollows may rebound.  
    For long has armor clung to flesh (or something out of reach);  
    And long has face been hidden, both their warmth and power leached.  

    Again I light the fire, crouching close and without fear.  
    Enveloped now in waves, soothing hope I must endear.  
    And for a time this metal glistens, reflecting all but shame,  
    Absorbing what it can, bending softly to the flame.  

    Is all such passion so produced, borne from one hot fire,  
    No other thoughts, no other dreams, no myriad desires?  
    Will the burning blaze return or settle down to rubble?  
    Will I kindle what remains or seize from endless struggle?  

    For if the blade embedded once could carry me thus far,  
    What might its master and I wield to further such a scar?  
    Could we crack this armored shell and rupture all the seals;  
    Expose the underneath but leave intact its metal peel?  

    Then might we try to reach beyond a site so neatly laid,  
    To find our warmth from other means not readily displayed,  
    To move beneath an empty sky, points of reference gone,  
    Journey through an undone land, protectors all withdrawn.  

    And pass would we the bends that wind to places barred from view,  
    Trudging forward, each solid step might seem like life renewed.  
    But we’d walk in solitude, past roads all marked with care,  
    Not to green and blossomed fields, to snow swept planes we’d dare.
