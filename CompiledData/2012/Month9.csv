Firstly, I am AMAB. But I am a woman. I only admitted this to myself within the last year, after fighting it for far too long. I really want to trans so I can be comfortable and happy as who I am, rather than who I appear to be.  My problem is where do I start? How do I go about this? I have read so much, with conflicting opinions and laundry lists of suggestions, that I am overwhelmed.  My depression has increased ever since I came to this realization because I understand why I have never been happy as I am.

A former 'friend' overheard me talking to a good friend about the fact that I am truly a woman and started spreading it around at my workplace, causing me to get fired. Unfortunately, where I live, they don't have to have a reason, or provide one, for letting you go. So, I have no legal recourse in that area.  This also means that I am broke, as the job market here is absolutely lousy, so I don't have the money to jump into the transitioning process.
(By the way, I apologize if some of my word choices or phrasing offends anyone as I am still new to a lot of things and language in the transitional community is one of them)
I want to present as a woman, but have a rather solidly built, masculine body that makes me unhappy with the way I present when dressed appropriately. This is even more depressing.  
I live in an area that is extremely intolerant, and that makes it more difficult.  I am depressed, and afraid, and excited, and nervous, and second-guessing and doubting myself due to the difficulty and fear.  
I am a bit older than most of the posters I have been reading on Reddit, as far as I can tell, and that makes me worry that I won't be taken seriously.  Even now, I am still debating posting this.  This post probably isn't the clearest, but I am pretty confused and lost myself.  If you have anything you want to ask, to clarify anything, please do.  I will answer to the best of my ability.

I don't want to step on any toes. I know some of you are very confident in your gender identities, and have been for a very long time. Understand that I find androgyny very confusing.

So I'm going to make this brief.

When I was younger, I questioned my gender identity, but decided that it would be too hard to convince people I was something *else*. I've posted about this before on here. Here's a few other snippets:

When a friend in aromatherapy offered to design something for me, I asked for an androgynous scent. Something that could be either one. I remember describing it as an ambiguous sort of lift-anyone-in-the-room's-spirits. Also, citrus.

I have [a commented lookbook](http://imgur.com/a/vrkyb). I tend to point out the ambiguous properties as ones I want to have for myself. However, sometimes I worry that I'm just trying to be *appealing to everyone*, not true to myself - some sort of repressed self-esteem issue.

TMI alert: Although I identify as grey-asexual, the majority of my imagined/desired experiences include a sexually intersex/hermaphroditic individual; often with me as said individual.

Judging from the above moments, does it seem like androgyny is a part of me, or simply something I like?

Sorry for the rambling nature of this post. I get really nervous when I post online about this sort of thing. 

I really need help with identifying myself. First off, I am a 24 year old male.

I would say when I was about 14 years old I began to fantasize about being turned into a woman. I researched and was under the belief I was a transsexual for years and years. However, throughout those years I would have phases where I never even thought about being female.  I planned all throughout my lower years of university to transition to a female. 

I met my SO 3 years ago. She is wonderful and dating her pretty much made my desire to be female disappear. She doesn't know about any of this nor do I plan on telling her. 

I get in these moods where all I can think about is being female. Then I get into moods where I don't think about being female for weeks.  I try to battle that by playing games online exclusively as female and posting on sports and gaming forums as female. It helps... sometimes. 

Anyway, I stumbled upon this subreddit and found out about dualgender, bigender, fluidgender. Can anyone highlight what you believe I described?  It really has opened up my life since I discovered this stuff a few weeks ago. Because I always thought I was just pushing the feminine desires away because it would be too hard or difficult. 

But if I can learn how to embrace both genders than I believe I could live a lot happier life.

Thanks for reading.

ill describe myself first. white. biologically male. early thirties. most people register me as straight, but definitely not all. i exhibit tendencies i guess. i gravitate toward the envelope pushers in society. heavily tattooed people. subcultures of all kinds. anyone fighting for something. i tend to seek out gay males for friendships like a kid catching pokemon. i dont sleep with men but i sometimes find them attractive. 

the problem is that im only attracted to very-gay-leaning, gender-bending biological females. dont write me off just yet. *i see you reaching to click back.* this isnt a fetish. this is why im taking the time to reach out here. i have fantasies about other things. i dont type ""genderqueer"" into porn search engines. theres a difference between what gets me hard and what makes my stomach ache and my ears get hot. 

its been this way forever. i remember being a kid in the late eighties and this movie came on tv called ""Just One of the Guys"". its about a girl who dresses as a boy through highschool so she can enroll in a journalism program. i remember being fascinated with her. i hated the end of the movie **spoiler alert** when she went back to being ""girly"". i couldnt understand how anyone could think the dainty submissive soft-featured girl was somehow more appealing than the cocky square-jawed fearless rebel. 

anyway. i find most ""typical"" girl behavior extremely aggravating to be around. i cant stand the damsel in distress routine. i find perfume, makeup, and lingerie well... gross. i guess gross is the actual word. 

and then i see a skinny butch female. cocky. confident. wearing levis and a tie. swagger everywhere. ready to fight the world. and my heart dies a little because i think that fearlessness is for someone else. shes never going to fight the tide of society to stand bravely holding my hand. in fact she probably thinks my beard is disgusting. 

i dont know. what do you think reddit? am i confusing what i admire with what i love? does it even matter what the motivation behind it is? what about the obvious issues that would arise(mostly-gay-leaning remember) if i were to end up dating a person like this? does anyone else have a similar situation? 

also ive kind of accepted this is really what i am into and have stopped dating CIS (believe thats correct?) females about two years ago. so im also interested in peoples ideas on dealing with loneliness and living in an area where the general population doesnt give you many dating options.

35,2012-09-21 03:04:59,108alt,20,18,"Hi,

I have a question concerning gender identity.

I have read in several places, when discussing trans* issues, that gender identity is a distinct thing from one’s gender role. That everybody has a gender identity that tells them what they are intuitively. They strongly feel like a man or like a woman. I don’t doubt that, and I know that this is very important to many people, but I’m confused about it.

I just can’t find that in myself. To me, gender identity has always been about the gender roles imposed by society. I can tell that, for example, I do not conform all too well to how men are traditionally “supposed” to be. So I certainly have an opinion on being a man based on that. But as I understand it, for most people, that is not all. They know that, for example, they are a man, even if they don’t agree with the traditional male gender role, and it is important to them. How does that work? Do you feel anything like that?

Saying “I am a man” feels weird to me. “I am a woman” feels even weirder, but that may just be because I’m physically male and was raised as a male. No matter how much I think about it or try to listen to my feelings, I just cannot find any intuitive feeling for it. I don’t know what “feeling like a man” or “feeling like a woman” really means beyond agreeing or disagreeing with the stereotypes associated with the genders. I feel no body dysphoria, but if I understand correctly that’s not really the criterion, either. Can you explain to me how, apart from external social attitudes, one can feel like a specific gender?

For instance, I'm a transsexual female, but I think of myself as androgyne femme.

This has only been my experience, but those I encounter who use ""genderqueer"" as a primary descriptor have tended to be doing so politically, i.e. they use it to express their intentionality behind queering society's gender norms (often in a feminist context), not necessarily as a gender identity unto itself. Those who assert an identity have tended to have a more specific term they prefer when giving a name to their gender identity. 

Those I meet who use genderqueer as their primary identity have tended to be CAFAB.

So I've known about gender queer for quite some time, and from the moment I heard about the term, I personally identified with it. The main reason I consider myself gender queer is that physically I am most attracted to, and prefer to present myself in a somewhat androgynous matter (though I still consider myself mostly gay). I also have a huge mix of interests and personality traits that I personally don't consider gender specific in any way. A few other tid bits about myself; I am very close to nature and animals.

I'm also a HUGE nerd (I also frequent /r/gaymers). Anyways, that's just a little bit about myself. Now onto my questions...

My first question is in regards to the gender queer term itself. I am someone who personally prefers to avoid labels, at least in regards to personal identity, so I was wondering if anyone agrees. Would you consider gender queer a ""label-less lable"" of sorts (yes I know, that is a complete oxymoron)? I ask, because the way I feel gender queer applies to me is that, the way that I am is that I don't restrict the way I dress or act based on the fact that I am biologically a male. Basically I try to just be myself as much as is possible. And while I personally don't need the gender queer identifier to help understand who I am, I do like it simply because it allows me to find others who I can relate to (such as finding this board). So I guess you can say that I do, and I don't identify as gender queer. Does that make sense to anyone? Does anyone else feel this way?

My other question is this; how does someone reconcile with the fact that in many professional settings, dressing and acting in a very androgynous manner is something that isn't really accepted in any way. I really only have two choices at this point in my life. Live a double life, in which I take myself out of my comfort zone and behave more stereotypically male while at work (and thus feel like I'm lying to myself all day), or quit my job and be unemployed (not really an option at all &gt;.&gt;).

I don't want to step on any toes. I know some of you are very confident in your gender identities, and have been for a very long time. Understand that I find androgyny very confusing.

So I'm going to make this brief.

When I was younger, I questioned my gender identity, but decided that it would be too hard to convince people I was something *else*. I've posted about this before on here. Here's a few other snippets:

When a friend in aromatherapy offered to design something for me, I asked for an androgynous scent. Something that could be either one. I remember describing it as an ambiguous sort of lift-anyone-in-the-room's-spirits. Also, citrus.

I have [a commented lookbook](http://imgur.com/a/vrkyb). I tend to point out the ambiguous properties as ones I want to have for myself. However, sometimes I worry that I'm just trying to be *appealing to everyone*, not true to myself - some sort of repressed self-esteem issue.

TMI alert: Although I identify as grey-asexual, the majority of my imagined/desired experiences include a sexually intersex/hermaphroditic individual; often with me as said individual.

Judging from the above moments, does it seem like androgyny is a part of me, or simply something I like?

11,2012-09-10 22:55:59,zoefs,3,9,"Hii everyone,

Sorry for the rambling nature of this post. I get really nervous when I post online about this sort of thing. 

I really need help with identifying myself. First off, I am a 24 year old male.

I would say when I was about 14 years old I began to fantasize about being turned into a woman. I researched and was under the belief I was a transsexual for years and years. However, throughout those years I would have phases where I never even thought about being female.  I planned all throughout my lower years of university to transition to a female. 

I met my SO 3 years ago. She is wonderful and dating her pretty much made my desire to be female disappear. She doesn't know about any of this nor do I plan on telling her. 

I get in these moods where all I can think about is being female. Then I get into moods where I don't think about being female for weeks.  I try to battle that by playing games online exclusively as female and posting on sports and gaming forums as female. It helps... sometimes. 

Anyway, I stumbled upon this subreddit and found out about dualgender, bigender, fluidgender. Can anyone highlight what you believe I described?  It really has opened up my life since I discovered this stuff a few weeks ago. Because I always thought I was just pushing the feminine desires away because it would be too hard or difficult. 

But if I can learn how to embrace both genders than I believe I could live a lot happier life.

I get really nervous when I post online about this sort of thing. \n\nI really need help with identifying myself. First off, I am a 24 year old male.\n\nI would say when I was about 14 years old I began to fantasize about being turned into a woman. I researched and was under the belief I was a transsexual for years and years. However, throughout those years I would have phases where I never even thought about being female.  I planned all throughout my lower years of university to transition to a female. \n\nI met my SO 3 years ago. She is wonderful and dating her pretty much made my desire to be female disappear. She doesn't know about any of this nor do I plan on telling her. \n\nI get in these moods where all I can think about is being female. Then I get into moods where I don't think about being female for weeks.  I try to battle that by playing games online exclusively as female and posting on sports and gaming forums as female. It helps... sometimes. \n\nAnyway, I stumbled upon this subreddit and found out about dualgender, bigender, fluidgender. Can anyone highlight what you believe I described?  It really has opened up my life since I discovered this stuff a few weeks ago. Because I always thought I was just pushing the feminine desires away because it would be too hard or difficult. \n\nBut if I can learn how to embrace both genders than I believe I could live a lot happier life.\n\nThanks for reading.\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Help with my identity', 'created': 1347342959.0}",11.0

ill describe myself first. white. biologically male. early thirties. most people register me as straight, but definitely not all. i exhibit tendencies i guess. i gravitate toward the envelope pushers in society. heavily tattooed people. subcultures of all kinds. anyone fighting for something. i tend to seek out gay males for friendships like a kid catching pokemon. i dont sleep with men but i sometimes find them attractive. 

the problem is that im only attracted to very-gay-leaning, gender-bending biological females. dont write me off just yet. *i see you reaching to click back.* this isnt a fetish. this is why im taking the time to reach out here. i have fantasies about other things. i dont type ""genderqueer"" into porn search engines. theres a difference between what gets me hard and what makes my stomach ache and my ears get hot. 

its been this way forever. i remember being a kid in the late eighties and this movie came on tv called ""Just One of the Guys"". its about a girl who dresses as a boy through highschool so she can enroll in a journalism program. i remember being fascinated with her. i hated the end of the movie **spoiler alert** when she went back to being ""girly"". i couldnt understand how anyone could think the dainty submissive soft-featured girl was somehow more appealing than the cocky square-jawed fearless rebel. 

anyway. i find most ""typical"" girl behavior extremely aggravating to be around. i cant stand the damsel in distress routine. i find perfume, makeup, and lingerie well... gross. i guess gross is the actual word. 

and then i see a skinny butch female. cocky. confident. wearing levis and a tie. swagger everywhere. ready to fight the world. and my heart dies a little because i think that fearlessness is for someone else. shes never going to fight the tide of society to stand bravely holding my hand. in fact she probably thinks my beard is disgusting. 

i dont know. what do you think reddit? am i confusing what i admire with what i love? does it even matter what the motivation behind it is? what about the obvious issues that would arise(mostly-gay-leaning remember) if i were to end up dating a person like this? does anyone else have a similar situation? 

also ive kind of accepted this is really what i am into and have stopped dating CIS (believe thats correct?) females about two years ago. so im also interested in peoples ideas on dealing with loneliness and living in an area where the general population doesnt give you many dating options.

Firstly, I am AMAB. But I am a woman. I only admitted this to myself within the last year, after fighting it for far too long. I really want to trans so I can be comfortable and happy as who I am, rather than who I appear to be.  My problem is where do I start? How do I go about this? I have read so much, with conflicting opinions and laundry lists of suggestions, that I am overwhelmed.  My depression has increased ever since I came to this realization because I understand why I have never been happy as I am.

A former 'friend' overheard me talking to a good friend about the fact that I am truly a woman and started spreading it around at my workplace, causing me to get fired. Unfortunately, where I live, they don't have to have a reason, or provide one, for letting you go. So, I have no legal recourse in that area.  This also means that I am broke, as the job market here is absolutely lousy, so I don't have the money to jump into the transitioning process.
(By the way, I apologize if some of my word choices or phrasing offends anyone as I am still new to a lot of things and language in the transitional community is one of them)
I want to present as a woman, but have a rather solidly built, masculine body that makes me unhappy with the way I present when dressed appropriately. This is even more depressing.  
I live in an area that is extremely intolerant, and that makes it more difficult.  I am depressed, and afraid, and excited, and nervous, and second-guessing and doubting myself due to the difficulty and fear.  
I am a bit older than most of the posters I have been reading on Reddit, as far as I can tell, and that makes me worry that I won't be taken seriously.  Even now, I am still debating posting this.

37,2012-09-21 03:04:59,108alt,20,18,"Hi,

I have a question concerning gender identity.

I have read in several places, when discussing trans* issues, that gender identity is a distinct thing from one’s gender role. That everybody has a gender identity that tells them what they are intuitively. They strongly feel like a man or like a woman. I don’t doubt that, and I know that this is very important to many people, but I’m confused about it.

I just can’t find that in myself. To me, gender identity has always been about the gender roles imposed by society. I can tell that, for example, I do not conform all too well to how men are traditionally “supposed” to be. So I certainly have an opinion on being a man based on that. But as I understand it, for most people, that is not all. They know that, for example, they are a man, even if they don’t agree with the traditional male gender role, and it is important to them. How does that work? Do you feel anything like that?

Saying “I am a man” feels weird to me. “I am a woman” feels even weirder, but that may just be because I’m physically male and was raised as a male. No matter how much I think about it or try to listen to my feelings, I just cannot find any intuitive feeling for it. I don’t know what “feeling like a man” or “feeling like a woman” really means beyond agreeing or disagreeing with the stereotypes associated with the genders. I feel no body dysphoria, but if I understand correctly that’s not really the criterion, either. Can you explain to me how, apart from external social attitudes, one can feel like a specific gender?

For instance, I'm a transsexual female, but I think of myself as androgyne femme.

This has only been my experience, but those I encounter who use ""genderqueer"" as a primary descriptor have tended to be doing so politically, i.e. they use it to express their intentionality behind queering society's gender norms (often in a feminist context), not necessarily as a gender identity unto itself. Those who assert an identity have tended to have a more specific term they prefer when giving a name to their gender identity. 

Those I meet who use genderqueer as their primary identity have tended to be CAFAB. CAMAB (specifically non-transsexual) people who ""fit"" the common understanding of genderqueer have been quick to label themselves in other ways: sissy, faerie, male femme, prettyboy, and some even have taken on metrosexual as a sepcific gender identity.

Basically, it comes down to this: The more masculine you are, the more attracted to feminine people you are. This is not gender specific, but it essentially says if you are masculine to a certain degree, you are attracted to people who are feminine to the similar degree. It also says that the farther down the scale it is, that is, the higher the degree of the masculine/feminine partnership, the more intense the sexual chemistry is.

My opinion: I am a fairly gender-neutral person. I don't see myself as particularly feminine or masculine. I also find myself attracted to more gender-neutral people...but not exclusively. Sometimes, I am attracted to very gendered people.

So I've known about gender queer for quite some time, and from the moment I heard about the term, I personally identified with it. The main reason I consider myself gender queer is that physically I am most attracted to, and prefer to present myself in a somewhat androgynous matter (though I still consider myself mostly gay). I also have a huge mix of interests and personality traits that I personally don't consider gender specific in any way. A few other tid bits about myself; I am very close to nature and animals. If I was able to describe my spirituality, it would have something to do with the fact that I feel all living creatures are connected in a magical sort of way. I'm also a HUGE nerd (I also frequent /r/gaymers). Anyways, that's just a little bit about myself. Now onto my questions...

My first question is in regards to the gender queer term itself. I am someone who personally prefers to avoid labels, at least in regards to personal identity, so I was wondering if anyone agrees. Would you consider gender queer a ""label-less lable"" of sorts (yes I know, that is a complete oxymoron)? I ask, because the way I feel gender queer applies to me is that, the way that I am is that I don't restrict the way I dress or act based on the fact that I am biologically a male. Basically I try to just be myself as much as is possible. And while I personally don't need the gender queer identifier to help understand who I am, I do like it simply because it allows me to find others who I can relate to (such as finding this board). So I guess you can say that I do, and I don't identify as gender queer. Does that make sense to anyone? Does anyone else feel this way?

My other question is this; how does someone reconcile with the fact that in many professional settings, dressing and acting in a very androgynous manner is something that isn't really accepted in any way. I really only have two choices at this point in my life. Live a double life, in which I take myself out of my comfort zone and behave more stereotypically male while at work (and thus feel like I'm lying to myself all day), or quit my job and be unemployed (not really an option at all &gt;.&gt;).
