3,2012-12-10 14:25:52,14lrx0,6,39,"To be honest my approach is a little different than the conventional wisdom.


The way I made myself start, honestly, was a trick. I told myself that I'd only do it for a month, and if that didn't work I'd stop. (Taking action was better than second guessing, at that point; sort of like how it's easier to take that first plunge off the high dive if you don't get stuck on the board staring at the water for minutes.) Transition was never a permanent thing for me; I constantly re-evaluated what was happening to make sure it was a good thing.

Instead of setitng transition as an ""Am I a man or a woman?"" question, though, I set it to a far simpler question.

""Do I feel better today than I did before transition?""

This has to be an average, of course. Some days will be harder than others. But I made sure to separate temporary issues (My family isn't handling it well, I don't pass, I wish this would go faster) from permanent changes (Holy hell I look so much better now than I did a month ago, my brain is settling down, I feel calm and happy despite the fact that I have to relearn how to deal with my emotions.) In particular:

-Do I like these breasts? This face? This skin? (Again, don't worry about what people will _think._ That is an externality you cannot control. Had I let my doubts of how my friends would react affect my decision I would not have transitioned, and in doing so missed out on one of the most important experiences of my life.

-Do I like the new mental state? Do I feel giddy at times, happy, pleased, calm? Again, transition may take you to the highest highs and lowest lows, but what is the overall average? Is it better than your past overall average? (I took a daily/weekly tally of how I felt day to day so I could review it - am a bit of an obsessive and a touch analytical when it comes to this. Was a HUGE help, though!)

-How would I feel about going back to being male? This was a hard question to answer sometimes, as transition can get pretty rough, but when I just sat down and was drop-dead honest with myself the idea just didn't feel right. Easier, maybe, but never quite ""right"" in the way that the way forward felt.

-Do I feel _right_? When I look in the mirror do I look more like myself than I did before? Again, this is one of those mushy subjective things. You'll probably agonize over it, and that's okay. But, on average, if you feel more like yourself with each passing day then you're probably doing something right.



Journaling! I can't suggest it enough. Your brain will be stuck in the now and won't see where you've come from, and when you don't have vision on that past you see it through rose-tinted glasses. Taking a journal helps separate your brain's perception from objective fact. Video diaries are especially useful, as you can see changes as they happen. This can serve as a friendly motivational push when you need an image- and confidence-boosting session; I know for the first two years I looked at the old me quite a bit, just to remind myself that things are constantly getting better.


The things I'd warn you about - and suggest that you not worry to much about!

-MTF: Your sex drive will die, yes. Probably for about three months or more. But considering you were having trouble already... is that a bad thing? I know mine started coming back when I was experiencing things from the ""right"" body. (I'm convinced now that sexual orientation, and to a certain degree sexuality, is a two-part equation. One is the gender presentation of the one you want to be with, the other is the gender presentation _you_ want to be when you're with them. This is a huge deal and cannot be understated; in fact, its the biggest ah-ha I had during transition, period!)

(-FTM: Your sex drive will double, at the very least. Welcome to being a guy with teenage-level hormones. :) )

-Girl, or boy? False. You have been sold a bill of goods by the trans community and the folks who do the gatekeeping when you worry about ""Am I a girl or a boy"" semantics. You are you. Your presentation will fluctuate - I was girly-girl for a few years until I settled in as a genderqueer tomboy - and the whole mess regarding a ""true"" transsexual, binary and all, is bullshit. Serious. All that matters is reducing dysphoria. The sooner you realize that this isn't about endpoints and is instead all about a journey, the sooner you'll relax and just start enjoying any transition you have.

-But will I transition fully? Depends on where you set your goalposts. The goal of transition is to reduce dysphoria. Period. If you're not comfortable in your body, you change it. Let the rest of the baggage go re: man or woman stuff. Everything, from hormones to any surgeries, exists only to reduce that dysphoria and make you comfortable in your own skin. You may need to play along at times to get cleared for HRT, sure. But never forget that this is all about the reduction of gender dysphoria.

-Most people honestly do not give a fuck about your gender. Seriously. Repeat that mantra until it sticks. Trans people are gaining visibility and acceptance now, and outside of some invasive questioning (which you can always, ALWAYS say no to!) most folks will just take it at face value. You aren't going to destroy their world, and they aren't going to destroy yours.

-Confidence is key. The whole spectrum of cis genders is such that if you want to fit in, you can. But in order to do so you have to stop acting like you have a dirty secret and start acting like you have control of your on faculties. The _second_ I decided to stop caring about what others thought; the second I stopped hanging on everyone's gender pronouns, hoping for some recognition; the moment I stopped worrying and started _doing_... I passed. Hasn't changed since.


**TL;DR: Transition is equal parts letting go of the male/female gender binary, keeping track of your mood over a long period of time, and learning how not to give a crap what people think of you; and the sooner you get there, the sooner you find out how awesome being trans can be.**",trans,"Unconventional wisdom on transition (4 years, post-op, mtf)",1355174752.0,"{'created_utc': 1355149552, 'id': '14lrx0', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 39, 'selftext': 'To be honest my approach is a little different than the conventional wisdom.\n\n\nThe way I made myself start, honestly, was a trick.

2,2012-12-03 05:39:26,146qxl,11,9,"I've been thinking a lot about getting a nickname, and switching to they/them pronouns. I think going by ""she"" keeps me more closeted and makes it more likely for my friends to reference me being a girl. And, it's sort of weird that my friends who I am out to will still use ""she"" based just on my sex. I don't see a she when I look in the mirror, why should I give my friends more of a reason to?

My name is Sam. Short for Samantha. I have a weird history with my name. For a while in high school and early college I wanted to go by Samantha because to me it flowed better and went better with my last name. But before realizing I'm genderqueer I already was going by Sam (my work name tag even says Sam instead of Samantha, thankfully). Now that I realize this, and I'm slowly coming out to my friends, I've been thinking about the possibility of going by a different one. For one thing, when I go by Sam, people still assume the right to call me Samantha. Also, most Sams I know are girls so it's more often associated with Samantha anyways. 

A reason this jumped in my head lately is because the name ""Caleb"" appeared. I hadn't even really been thinking about changing my name, just pronouns at that point. Right away I thought about me going by it and it felt amazing for some reason. Now, this isn't a unisex name, it's considered a male name. I'm not the least bit binary identified, I don't even consider myself trans-masculine or in-between male and female. I'm just not a woman. My gender has no relation or connection to binary genders at all. So, that's in a way a drawback. But it also sort of fits because it challenges gendered names and also separates me more from being a woman than I otherwise would be. But it doesn't sound really masculine either, so it's nice. And I really like it. Another drawback is that I don't know how it sounds with my last name (alliteration, lol). But on the other hand it'll be a few years before I use it more officially because I'm not ready to be completely out. Another name I thought of was Morgan, because I always really liked the name, especially for guys. Most people I've talked to though, think it's more a girl's name. Which isn't a great fix for people thinking my name is feminine, but it also is a bit better because it would be safer for me to use as it's unisex. Another unisex name I like is Skylar, and it at least starts with my first initial. 

What do you guys think? 

*edit*: I feel like at this point the only thing keeping me from going with Caleb is how it fits with my last name. I mentioned these names to a friend and we both voted off Morgan.

I remember my “boy days”-  days when I looked down and was revolted at  what I saw.  Days when I put on the bra that made me look the flattest, a loose shirt and hand-me-downs from my male friends.  Days when I felt confused, depressed, and winced at words like “she” and “girl”.  But, I remember laying in bed in my singular pair of boxers, made from an old pair of plaid pajama bottoms that I had hemmed, listening to that song.  Smiling, as I started to dry my tears, then standing up to dance, as I knew that if I were to be a proper boy, the tears would have to stop.  Sometimes, forcibly choking them down without a smile to replace them, since the tears seemed to illegitimize my feelings.
	I started telling my friends, “I’m not really a girl”, when my differences were pointed out in conversation.  They smiled and nodded, not really knowing what it meant.  I don’t think I did either. 
There’s a venue in a not-so-safe part of town that my friends and I frequent.  Once, my friends were jumped by a group of gang-bangers outside of a Queers show.  It was an 11-on-3 fight that they only escaped with the help of a bystander and a bouncer.  I was inside, nursing a hurt leg-  the mosh pit had not been kind to my bad knee, and I had to pop it back into place.  I didn’t know what had happened until I saw S.’s girlfriend, Co.,  with tears streaming down her face.  C., with a bit of blood on his cheek, told me that we had to leave, immediately.  We snuck back to his car and sped out of that neighborhood.  Everyone was frightened, but no one but Co. cried.  While driving home, and towards the hospital, they told what had happened.  The gang bangers had been harassing Co., and the boys called them out on it.  They kept going outside to see if they were lingering.  Their tough act did them no favors, though.  Fighting did no good, and it seemed that they had only barely gotten away.  
	As we approach our own neighborhood, S. looked at me, and asked if I needed to go home through the bloody paper towel that was stuck to his split lip.  He knew that my knee was hurt, and I needed some painkillers and rest.  I told him that he needed the hospital more, and that my knee could wait a few hours.  He insisted that he would be fine, and I was driven home first.  
	After that incident, C. became determined to learn how to fight.  He wanted to take boxing, taekwondo, and get stronger.  He asked me if I could sew thin metal sheets to the inside of his leather jacket, for armor.  He needed to prove himself like a child who had fallen off of their first bike.  He had to prove that he was a man, not a failure.  
	S., on the other hand, was not on board for all of this.  I saw my friend, who used to hand me all of his valuables and run towards a fight with a lighter in his fist, shrink away from confrontation for the first time in my memory.  He said that he knew he had been wrong before- being able to punch someone says nothing about your real strength, and no petty argument was worth paying for with your health or life. Three weeks later, he and his girlfriend went back to the venue, with no problems.  
	Months ago, I sat in the passenger’s seat of S.’s car, upset, but having a hard time choking the words out.  My friend had died a few days earlier, and I was taking it hard.  I had tried to see S. before that night, but he had been busy.   As I told him, he drove silently, dragging on a cigarette and looking straight ahead.  He asked me why I had waited to tell him if it had been bothering me for so long.  I brushed it off, joking that he had had better things to do, while a lump in my throat rose up to become water in my eyes. He said “Some things are more important;  there’s always time for friends.”  I told him about the guilt I felt over it, the distress, the disbelief that I could let this feeling envelope me so fully.  He responded his “What’s wrong with caring?  What’s wrong with feeling bad?”  I told him that I couldn’t see anything wrong with either of those, that I always tried to feel whatever I was going to feel and deal with it from there.   
S. told me about the last time he had cried since childhood.  It was a couple years ago, and he probably wouldn’t like me to tell you the circumstances behind it.  That aside,  he said that everyone mourns in different ways, and no way is the wrong way.  That it was okay to be sad about something, and it was okay to cry. 

A few nights ago, I was driving around with N., who is somewhere in between being my friend and my lover.  A lot of my life takes place in the passenger seat of other people’s cars. Earlier that day, I had sent him an article on masculinity, and how men are pressured to disguise their emotions. 
 I should preface this by saying that Nate has lots of feelings. On average, I deal with a crying N. twice a week. Once, as we lay in bed next to each other, just talking, a switch flipped, and out came the tears.  That particular night, he started disparaging himself, saying “Look at me.  Fuckin’ cry baby.” I smiled, and wiped his cheek.  “Well, that’s all bullshit, anyways.  Gender roles, right?”, he said, laughing through tears.  
While discussing the article, he told me that he didn’t feel manly when he cried, and that he always expects me to be annoyed with him because of it.  To find him unattractive or weak.  I told him that I didn’t mind. It didn’t affect me like that, no really, it didn’t.  He said that being manly, in his mind, was being in control of your emotions, and being responsible- a leader.  It seems to me that he just described an adult, not a man, specifically.  After a few minutes of riding along,  a song came up on the mixed CD I had made him almost half a year ago.  It was “Boys Don’t Cry”;  I turned it up, and silently chuckled at the coincidence.  
	Today, S. and I sat outside on the back staircase that leads to the apartments above the studio we work at.  We smoked our cigarettes, making a game out of writing on each other’s pants with the ashes.  We tried to make plans for what to do tonight.  He joked,  “I feel like staying in, drinking a bottle of wine, and crying all night.  I haven’t had a good night like that in a while.”  We laughed, and I said “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you cry.”  He told me, once again, that he hadn’t in a very long time.  But, this time he added, “I don’t really feel the need to weep.  It doesn’t change anything or make me feel any better.”  I paused for a minute, “I suppose it’s okay not to cry if you never feel like it.  The problem is when you want to cry and you can’t.”  After a minute, we carried on our conversation, then strolled back inside to work. 
	Towards the end of November, I finally told my friends the word to describe people like me- genderqueer.  They listened and tried to understand.  S. called me “a perfect gentleman” earlier on when I refused to tell the details of a past fling I had had with a girl we both knew.  They try to understand, but I’m not sure they really do.  I’m not sure I really do.  
	The truth is, the world taught me what sort of girl it thought I should be.  Experience taught me what sort of girl I am. I’ll probably never tell them this, but I wonder if my friends know that they’re the ones who taught me how to be a man.

Or that you don\'t feel right calling yourself either male or female sometimes? I am aggressive and ""manly"" in some ways and girly in others. I\'m not insulted to be seen as male or female. I have a name used by both genders. But I\'m just not sure how to feel about this realization. Is there space to be so... unassigned in our world? I can look very androgynous if I cut my hair short and wear no makeup, but I\'m also a very short girl so...\n\nI\'m just not sure where to begin. Or if I already have.

Right now, we've got an empty flair space that has to be there for people who do not want a flag. It's an option that has to be there for the ""no flag, just text"" CSS to work properly.

&gt;&lt;3 you are such a lover. Why can't you just be a boy so I could fly out there and marry you tomorrow?

I ask her why.

&gt;Because you'd make the best most caring and intelligent boyfriend ever. You pretty much have it all.

It was so incredibly flattering. Lately I've come to accept that, not only was I a tomboy growing up but I'm not an ally for the LGBT movement - I'm part of it. This was conflicting for me. Prior to a couple months ago, I would have never considered myself part of the community.


When I joined reddit, I watched a bunch of subs, and a bunch for LGBT and other queer issues, wanting to educate myself so I would never have to inadvertently stick my foot in my mouth and upset someone else. I only knew trans* individuals from a chat I belonged to online, so I figured hey, I want to know more, so I especially digged into trans* issues. Found a ftm (though not very friendly) chat, and wanted to learn more. The chat didn't last long for me, and I didn't find it helpful.


All while this was happening, I decided that I wanted to lose weight (as of this past August).  I have been told that I am a very attractive woman, and although on the chubby (for some) or just plain fat (for others), I decided – even if I was happy with my body, I would lose weight to be healthier.


As it went on, my partner didn't pay much attention to my progress and honestly didn't seem to care. It, along with our deadbedroom situation, it just felt like he had no interest for my body anymore, so between trying to lose weight, it being a frustratingly slow process, and finding myself ugly, I really began to hate my body. Before all of this, I accepted that I was a woman. I never questioned myself or thought of myself as genderqueer. It never was on my mind – even if I've been quite the tomboy as a kid and even as an adult.


Of the past few days, I've accepted that this body isn't “mine.” I don't feel like I am connected, and I even feel a disconnect from who I was two years ago, it's a lot to swallow. My mind doesn't feel 100% femme and I realized that some (not all) of my unhappiness comes with me feeling awkward in my body. I'm at an age where I'm supposed to dress quite feminine (especially as a professional) and I really just want to say “fuck you” to the system.


As I slowly lose more weight I think I will be happier with my body. I am hoping to feel at one with myself again, and accept myself again – I have absolutely no desire to transition, and honestly, I find dicks pretty damn ugly and I would hate to get bottom or top surgery. I'm at a body type where I would NEVER look good as a man, but I do look nice dressed somewhat masculine (I have described it to others as quite preppy or athletic). And definitely exciting, I will only look better as I lose more weight.


So those texts were absolutely amazing to read. I've thought about male names I would want if I were born male, and how I would live my life if I was a taller, with the successful life that I am striving to achieve now. Though I know I can never be someone's boyfriend, it was extremely flattering and just rubbed me all the right ways. I have not come out to anyone. I mentioned it to my partner before he left for basic military training but he has no idea to the extent that I feel. I am afraid that he will not accept me and will not want to be with me. But then another part of me finds that silly, as I'm not changing, I'm merely putting a label to how I've been my entire life.


I hope everyone's had a wonderful Christmas, or other holidays if Christmas isn't your thing (mine personally was terrible and I'm emotionally drained from family drama and bullshit).

It never was on my mind – even if I've been quite the tomboy as a kid and even as an adult.\n\n\nOf the past few days, I've accepted that this body isn't “mine.” I don't feel like I am connected, and I even feel a disconnect from who I was two years ago, it's a lot to swallow. My mind doesn't feel 100% femme and I realized that some (not all) of my unhappiness comes with me feeling awkward in my body. I'm at an age where I'm supposed to dress quite feminine (especially as a professional) and I really just want to say “fuck you” to the system.\n\n\nAs I slowly lose more weight I think I will be happier with my body. I am hoping to feel at one with myself again, and accept myself again – I have absolutely no desire to transition, and honestly, I find dicks pretty damn ugly and I would hate to get bottom or top surgery. I'm at a body type where I would NEVER look good as a man, but I do look nice dressed somewhat masculine (I have described it to others as quite preppy or athletic). And definitely exciting, I will only look better as I lose more weight.\n\n\nSo those texts were absolutely amazing to read. I've thought about male names I would want if I were born male, and how I would live my life if I was a taller, with the successful life that I am striving to achieve now. Though I know I can never be someone's boyfriend, it was extremely flattering and just rubbed me all the right ways. I have not come out to anyone. I mentioned it to my partner before he left for basic military training but he has no idea to the extent that I feel. I am afraid that he will not accept me and will not want to be with me. But then another part of me finds that silly, as I'm not changing, I'm merely putting a label to how I've been my entire life.\n\n\nI hope everyone's had a wonderful Christmas, or other holidays if Christmas isn't your thing (mine personally was terrible and I'm emotionally drained from family drama and bullshit).\n\nEnjoy your holidays and upcoming New Year. Be safe, be happy, and good luck to you if you're still finding yourself."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Got the most flattering texts last night.', 'created': 1356505628.0}",

I think going by ""she"" keeps me more closeted and makes it more likely for my friends to reference me being a girl. And, it's sort of weird that my friends who I am out to will still use ""she"" based just on my sex. I don't see a she when I look in the mirror, why should I give my friends more of a reason to?

My name is Sam. Short for Samantha. I have a weird history with my name. For a while in high school and early college I wanted to go by Samantha because to me it flowed better and went better with my last name. But before realizing I'm genderqueer I already was going by Sam (my work name tag even says Sam instead of Samantha, thankfully). Now that I realize this, and I'm slowly coming out to my friends, I've been thinking about the possibility of going by a different one. For one thing, when I go by Sam, people still assume the right to call me Samantha. Also, most Sams I know are girls so it's more often associated with Samantha anyways. 

A reason this jumped in my head lately is because the name ""Caleb"" appeared. I hadn't even really been thinking about changing my name, just pronouns at that point. Right away I thought about me going by it and it felt amazing for some reason. Now, this isn't a unisex name, it's considered a male name. I'm not the least bit binary identified, I don't even consider myself trans-masculine or in-between male and female. I'm just not a woman. My gender has no relation or connection to binary genders at all. So, that's in a way a drawback. But it also sort of fits because it challenges gendered names and also separates me more from being a woman than I otherwise would be. But it doesn't sound really masculine either, so it's nice. And I really like it. Another drawback is that I don't know how it sounds with my last name (alliteration, lol). But on the other hand it'll be a few years before I use it more officially because I'm not ready to be completely out. Another name I thought of was Morgan, because I always really liked the name, especially for guys. Most people I've talked to though, think it's more a girl's name. Which isn't a great fix for people thinking my name is feminine, but it also is a bit better because it would be safer for me to use as it's unisex. Another unisex name I like is Skylar, and it at least starts with my first initial. 

What do you guys think? 

*edit*: I feel like at this point the only thing keeping me from going with Caleb is how it fits with my last name. I mentioned these names to a friend and we both voted off Morgan.

19,2012-12-10 14:25:52,14lrx0,6,39,"To be honest my approach is a little different than the conventional wisdom.


The way I made myself start, honestly, was a trick. I told myself that I'd only do it for a month, and if that didn't work I'd stop. (Taking action was better than second guessing, at that point; sort of like how it's easier to take that first plunge off the high dive if you don't get stuck on the board staring at the water for minutes.) Transition was never a permanent thing for me; I constantly re-evaluated what was happening to make sure it was a good thing.

Instead of setitng transition as an ""Am I a man or a woman?"" question, though, I set it to a far simpler question.

""Do I feel better today than I did before transition?""

This has to be an average, of course. Some days will be harder than others. But I made sure to separate temporary issues (My family isn't handling it well, I don't pass, I wish this would go faster) from permanent changes (Holy hell I look so much better now than I did a month ago, my brain is settling down, I feel calm and happy despite the fact that I have to relearn how to deal with my emotions.) In particular:

-Do I like these breasts? This face? This skin? (Again, don't worry about what people will _think._ That is an externality you cannot control. Had I let my doubts of how my friends would react affect my decision I would not have transitioned, and in doing so missed out on one of the most important experiences of my life.

-Do I like the new mental state? Do I feel giddy at times, happy, pleased, calm? Again, transition may take you to the highest highs and lowest lows, but what is the overall average? Is it better than your past overall average? (I took a daily/weekly tally of how I felt day to day so I could review it - am a bit of an obsessive and a touch analytical when it comes to this. Was a HUGE help, though!)

-How would I feel about going back to being male? This was a hard question to answer sometimes, as transition can get pretty rough, but when I just sat down and was drop-dead honest with myself the idea just didn't feel right. Easier, maybe, but never quite ""right"" in the way that the way forward felt.

-Do I feel _right_? When I look in the mirror do I look more like myself than I did before? Again, this is one of those mushy subjective things. You'll probably agonize over it, and that's okay. But, on average, if you feel more like yourself with each passing day then you're probably doing something right.



Journaling! I can't suggest it enough. Your brain will be stuck in the now and won't see where you've come from, and when you don't have vision on that past you see it through rose-tinted glasses. Taking a journal helps separate your brain's perception from objective fact. Video diaries are especially useful, as you can see changes as they happen. This can serve as a friendly motivational push when you need an image- and confidence-boosting session; I know for the first two years I looked at the old me quite a bit, just to remind myself that things are constantly getting better.


The things I'd warn you about - and suggest that you not worry to much about!

-MTF: Your sex drive will die, yes. Probably for about three months or more. But considering you were having trouble already... is that a bad thing? I know mine started coming back when I was experiencing things from the ""right"" body. (I'm convinced now that sexual orientation, and to a certain degree sexuality, is a two-part equation. One is the gender presentation of the one you want to be with, the other is the gender presentation _you_ want to be when you're with them. This is a huge deal and cannot be understated; in fact, its the biggest ah-ha I had during transition, period!)

(-FTM: Your sex drive will double, at the very least. Welcome to being a guy with teenage-level hormones. :) )

-Girl, or boy? False. You have been sold a bill of goods by the trans community and the folks who do the gatekeeping when you worry about ""Am I a girl or a boy"" semantics. You are you. Your presentation will fluctuate - I was girly-girl for a few years until I settled in as a genderqueer tomboy - and the whole mess regarding a ""true"" transsexual, binary and all, is bullshit. Serious. All that matters is reducing dysphoria. The sooner you realize that this isn't about endpoints and is instead all about a journey, the sooner you'll relax and just start enjoying any transition you have.

-But will I transition fully? Depends on where you set your goalposts. The goal of transition is to reduce dysphoria. Period. If you're not comfortable in your body, you change it. Let the rest of the baggage go re: man or woman stuff. Everything, from hormones to any surgeries, exists only to reduce that dysphoria and make you comfortable in your own skin. You may need to play along at times to get cleared for HRT, sure. But never forget that this is all about the reduction of gender dysphoria.

-Most people honestly do not give a fuck about your gender. Seriously. Repeat that mantra until it sticks. Trans people are gaining visibility and acceptance now, and outside of some invasive questioning (which you can always, ALWAYS say no to!) most folks will just take it at face value. You aren't going to destroy their world, and they aren't going to destroy yours.

-Confidence is key. The whole spectrum of cis genders is such that if you want to fit in, you can. But in order to do so you have to stop acting like you have a dirty secret and start acting like you have control of your on faculties. The _second_ I decided to stop caring about what others thought; the second I stopped hanging on everyone's gender pronouns, hoping for some recognition; the moment I stopped worrying and started _doing_... I passed. Hasn't changed since.


**TL;DR: Transition is equal parts letting go of the male/female gender binary, keeping track of your mood over a long period of time, and learning how not to give a crap what people think of you; and the sooner you get there, the sooner you find out how awesome being trans can be.**",trans,"Unconventional wisdom on transition (4 years, post-op, mtf)",1355174752.0,"{'created_utc': 1355149552, 'id': '14lrx0', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 39, 'selftext': 'To be honest my approach is a little different than the conventional wisdom.\n\n\nThe way I made myself start, honestly, was a trick.

I remember my “boy days”-  days when I looked down and was revolted at  what I saw.  Days when I put on the bra that made me look the flattest, a loose shirt and hand-me-downs from my male friends.  Days when I felt confused, depressed, and winced at words like “she” and “girl”.  But, I remember laying in bed in my singular pair of boxers, made from an old pair of plaid pajama bottoms that I had hemmed, listening to that song.  Smiling, as I started to dry my tears, then standing up to dance, as I knew that if I were to be a proper boy, the tears would have to stop.  Sometimes, forcibly choking them down without a smile to replace them, since the tears seemed to illegitimize my feelings.
	I started telling my friends, “I’m not really a girl”, when my differences were pointed out in conversation.  They smiled and nodded, not really knowing what it meant.  I don’t think I did either. 
There’s a venue in a not-so-safe part of town that my friends and I frequent.  Once, my friends were jumped by a group of gang-bangers outside of a Queers show.  It was an 11-on-3 fight that they only escaped with the help of a bystander and a bouncer.  I was inside, nursing a hurt leg-  the mosh pit had not been kind to my bad knee, and I had to pop it back into place.  I didn’t know what had happened until I saw S.’s girlfriend, Co.,  with tears streaming down her face.  C., with a bit of blood on his cheek, told me that we had to leave, immediately.  We snuck back to his car and sped out of that neighborhood.  Everyone was frightened, but no one but Co. cried.  While driving home, and towards the hospital, they told what had happened.  The gang bangers had been harassing Co., and the boys called them out on it.  They kept going outside to see if they were lingering.  Their tough act did them no favors, though.  Fighting did no good, and it seemed that they had only barely gotten away.  
	As we approach our own neighborhood, S. looked at me, and asked if I needed to go home through the bloody paper towel that was stuck to his split lip.  He knew that my knee was hurt, and I needed some painkillers and rest.  I told him that he needed the hospital more, and that my knee could wait a few hours.  He insisted that he would be fine, and I was driven home first.  
	After that incident, C. became determined to learn how to fight.  He wanted to take boxing, taekwondo, and get stronger.  He asked me if I could sew thin metal sheets to the inside of his leather jacket, for armor.  He needed to prove himself like a child who had fallen off of their first bike.  He had to prove that he was a man, not a failure.  
	S., on the other hand, was not on board for all of this.  I saw my friend, who used to hand me all of his valuables and run towards a fight with a lighter in his fist, shrink away from confrontation for the first time in my memory.  He said that he knew he had been wrong before- being able to punch someone says nothing about your real strength, and no petty argument was worth paying for with your health or life. Three weeks later, he and his girlfriend went back to the venue, with no problems.  
	Months ago, I sat in the passenger’s seat of S.’s car, upset, but having a hard time choking the words out.  My friend had died a few days earlier, and I was taking it hard.  I had tried to see S. before that night, but he had been busy.   As I told him, he drove silently, dragging on a cigarette and looking straight ahead.  He asked me why I had waited to tell him if it had been bothering me for so long.  I brushed it off, joking that he had had better things to do, while a lump in my throat rose up to become water in my eyes. He said “Some things are more important;  there’s always time for friends.”  I told him about the guilt I felt over it, the distress, the disbelief that I could let this feeling envelope me so fully.  He responded his “What’s wrong with caring?  What’s wrong with feeling bad?”  I told him that I couldn’t see anything wrong with either of those, that I always tried to feel whatever I was going to feel and deal with it from there.   
S. told me about the last time he had cried since childhood.  It was a couple years ago, and he probably wouldn’t like me to tell you the circumstances behind it.  That aside,  he said that everyone mourns in different ways, and no way is the wrong way.  That it was okay to be sad about something, and it was okay to cry. 

A few nights ago, I was driving around with N., who is somewhere in between being my friend and my lover.  A lot of my life takes place in the passenger seat of other people’s cars. Earlier that day, I had sent him an article on masculinity, and how men are pressured to disguise their emotions. 
 I should preface this by saying that Nate has lots of feelings. On average, I deal with a crying N. twice a week. Once, as we lay in bed next to each other, just talking, a switch flipped, and out came the tears.  That particular night, he started disparaging himself, saying “Look at me.  Fuckin’ cry baby.” I smiled, and wiped his cheek.  “Well, that’s all bullshit, anyways.  Gender roles, right?”, he said, laughing through tears.  
While discussing the article, he told me that he didn’t feel manly when he cried, and that he always expects me to be annoyed with him because of it.  To find him unattractive or weak.  I told him that I didn’t mind. It didn’t affect me like that, no really, it didn’t.  He said that being manly, in his mind, was being in control of your emotions, and being responsible- a leader.  It seems to me that he just described an adult, not a man, specifically.  After a few minutes of riding along,  a song came up on the mixed CD I had made him almost half a year ago.  It was “Boys Don’t Cry”;  I turned it up, and silently chuckled at the coincidence.  
	Today, S. and I sat outside on the back staircase that leads to the apartments above the studio we work at.  We smoked our cigarettes, making a game out of writing on each other’s pants with the ashes.  We tried to make plans for what to do tonight.  He joked,  “I feel like staying in, drinking a bottle of wine, and crying all night.  I haven’t had a good night like that in a while.”  We laughed, and I said “I don’t think I’ve ever seen you cry.”  He told me, once again, that he hadn’t in a very long time.  But, this time he added, “I don’t really feel the need to weep.  It doesn’t change anything or make me feel any better.”  I paused for a minute, “I suppose it’s okay not to cry if you never feel like it.  The problem is when you want to cry and you can’t.”  After a minute, we carried on our conversation, then strolled back inside to work. 
	Towards the end of November, I finally told my friends the word to describe people like me- genderqueer.  They listened and tried to understand.  S. called me “a perfect gentleman” earlier on when I refused to tell the details of a past fling I had had with a girl we both knew.  They try to understand, but I’m not sure they really do.  I’m not sure I really do.  
	The truth is, the world taught me what sort of girl it thought I should be.  Experience taught me what sort of girl I am. I’ll probably never tell them this, but I wonder if my friends know that they’re the ones who taught me how to be a man.

&gt;&lt;3 you are such a lover. Why can't you just be a boy so I could fly out there and marry you tomorrow?

I ask her why.

&gt;Because you'd make the best most caring and intelligent boyfriend ever. You pretty much have it all.

It was so incredibly flattering. Lately I've come to accept that, not only was I a tomboy growing up but I'm not an ally for the LGBT movement - I'm part of it. This was conflicting for me. Prior to a couple months ago, I would have never considered myself part of the community.


When I joined reddit, I watched a bunch of subs, and a bunch for LGBT and other queer issues, wanting to educate myself so I would never have to inadvertently stick my foot in my mouth and upset someone else. I only knew trans* individuals from a chat I belonged to online, so I figured hey, I want to know more, so I especially digged into trans* issues. Found a ftm (though not very friendly) chat, and wanted to learn more. The chat didn't last long for me, and I didn't find it helpful.


All while this was happening, I decided that I wanted to lose weight (as of this past August).  I have been told that I am a very attractive woman, and although on the chubby (for some) or just plain fat (for others), I decided – even if I was happy with my body, I would lose weight to be healthier.


As it went on, my partner didn't pay much attention to my progress and honestly didn't seem to care. It, along with our deadbedroom situation, it just felt like he had no interest for my body anymore, so between trying to lose weight, it being a frustratingly slow process, and finding myself ugly, I really began to hate my body. Before all of this, I accepted that I was a woman. I never questioned myself or thought of myself as genderqueer. It never was on my mind – even if I've been quite the tomboy as a kid and even as an adult.


Of the past few days, I've accepted that this body isn't “mine.” I don't feel like I am connected, and I even feel a disconnect from who I was two years ago, it's a lot to swallow. My mind doesn't feel 100% femme and I realized that some (not all) of my unhappiness comes with me feeling awkward in my body. I'm at an age where I'm supposed to dress quite feminine (especially as a professional) and I really just want to say “fuck you” to the system.


As I slowly lose more weight I think I will be happier with my body. I am hoping to feel at one with myself again, and accept myself again – I have absolutely no desire to transition, and honestly, I find dicks pretty damn ugly and I would hate to get bottom or top surgery. I'm at a body type where I would NEVER look good as a man, but I do look nice dressed somewhat masculine (I have described it to others as quite preppy or athletic). And definitely exciting, I will only look better as I lose more weight.


So those texts were absolutely amazing to read. I've thought about male names I would want if I were born male, and how I would live my life if I was a taller, with the successful life that I am striving to achieve now. Though I know I can never be someone's boyfriend, it was extremely flattering and just rubbed me all the right ways. I have not come out to anyone. I mentioned it to my partner before he left for basic military training but he has no idea to the extent that I feel. I am afraid that he will not accept me and will not want to be with me. But then another part of me finds that silly, as I'm not changing, I'm merely putting a label to how I've been my entire life.


I hope everyone's had a wonderful Christmas, or other holidays if Christmas isn't your thing (mine personally was terrible and I'm emotionally drained from family drama and bullshit).

Enjoy your holidays and upcoming New Year.

Why can't you just be a boy so I could fly out there and marry you tomorrow?\n\nI ask her why.\n\n&gt;Because you'd make the best most caring and intelligent boyfriend ever. You pretty much have it all.\n\nIt was so incredibly flattering. Lately I've come to accept that, not only was I a tomboy growing up but I'm not an ally for the LGBT movement - I'm part of it. This was conflicting for me. Prior to a couple months ago, I would have never considered myself part of the community.\n\n\nWhen I joined reddit, I watched a bunch of subs, and a bunch for LGBT and other queer issues, wanting to educate myself so I would never have to inadvertently stick my foot in my mouth and upset someone else. I only knew trans* individuals from a chat I belonged to online, so I figured hey, I want to know more, so I especially digged into trans* issues. Found a ftm (though not very friendly) chat, and wanted to learn more. The chat didn't last long for me, and I didn't find it helpful.\n\n\nAll while this was happening, I decided that I wanted to lose weight (as of this past August).  I have been told that I am a very attractive woman, and although on the chubby (for some) or just plain fat (for others), I decided – even if I was happy with my body, I would lose weight to be healthier.\n\n\nAs it went on, my partner didn't pay much attention to my progress and honestly didn't seem to care. It, along with our deadbedroom situation, it just felt like he had no interest for my body anymore, so between trying to lose weight, it being a frustratingly slow process, and finding myself ugly, I really began to hate my body. Before all of this, I accepted that I was a woman. I never questioned myself or thought of myself as genderqueer. It never was on my mind – even if I've been quite the tomboy as a kid and even as an adult.\n\n\nOf the past few days, I've accepted that this body isn't “mine.” I don't feel like I am connected, and I even feel a disconnect from who I was two years ago, it's a lot to swallow.

I'm a 19 year old female, and I feel like I'm having a gender-identity crisis, which is pretty notable for me. For the majority of my life I have been largely uncaring of my gender. I dress androginously, usially in unisex T-shirts with cargo pants or jeans. In middle school I decided I was Bisexual, but gave up on it around the end of highschool, because... well...    ... anyway...

In the last year or so I've been having a harder and harder time being okay with being female. I handled menstruating pretty well for a long time, despite cramps that made me puke and mood swings that made me a monster. But now... now I want to be able to just not menstruate. I hate my uterus. I hate the discomfort and pain and I hate the insanity-inducing mood swings, and I just want it to stop.

In highschool my breasts were B's and later C's, and that was fine. It was okay, I liked them that way. In the last year though, they've grown beyond DD's, nearly every bra I can find hurts me for some reason or other. I've conidered breast-reduction surgery, but after reading up on it the concept of the process terrifies me. Since my breasts are so large, I can't not wear a bra without the weight pulling on my chest painfully, so I've survived with a few sports bras and a single D bra in a size up from what I should be, which barely fits at all but is better than nothing.

I just... I needed someone to bring that all out to.

I have other, more personal/NSFW reasons for my gender identity crisis, but I don't want to share them right away, just in case that would be TMI for some people.

The questions that I have for whoever will answer are these:

1. What do you think of my overall situation, and do you want to know more?

2. Are there different ""levels"" of transgender-ism? are some people more or less transgender than others? Is it possible to be transgender to androgynous(having no gender)?

3. Are there ""right"" and ""wrong"" reasons for being transgender?

I handled menstruating pretty well for a long time, despite cramps that made me puke and mood swings that made me a monster. But now... now I want to be able to just not menstruate. I hate my uterus. I hate the discomfort and pain and I hate the insanity-inducing mood swings, and I just want it to stop.

In highschool my breasts were B's and later C's, and that was fine. It was okay, I liked them that way. In the last year though, they've grown beyond DD's, nearly every bra I can find hurts me for some reason or other. I've conidered breast-reduction surgery, but after reading up on it the concept of the process terrifies me. Since my breasts are so large, I can't not wear a bra without the weight pulling on my chest painfully, so I've survived with a few sports bras and a single D bra in a size up from what I should be, which barely fits at all but is better than nothing.

I just... I needed someone to bring that all out to.

I have other, more personal/NSFW reasons for my gender identity crisis, but I don't want to share them right away, just in case that would be TMI for some people.

The questions that I have for whoever will answer are these:

1. What do you think of my overall situation, and do you want to know more?

2. Are there different ""levels"" of transgender-ism? are some people more or less transgender than others? Is it possible to be transgender to androgynous(having no gender)?

3. Are there ""right"" and ""wrong"" reasons for being transgender?

I know I shouldn't care what I receive - but frankly, it would be better to get nothing than to try to pretend to be happy with this stuff.

At least the kids spread enough joy for everyone, which makes me smile regardless.

245,2012-12-25 18:32:32,15fgem,4,3,"I was at work this day last year, rolling around the store in an office chair, while co-workers rang customers up. I was the management on duty for the day, and I did my rolly chair duties well. I gave my co-workers time in the chair too, as all must enjoy the bliss of rolling around a store like crazies for customers to see.

A year before that: I was sad! Uncontrollably sad! I was not working at all. I was alone with my thoughts, and I dreamed good dreams of the future, of friends I'd make and new loves I'd find.

2009: I was alone yet again. I dreamed good dreams of the future. I dreamt of the future and the life I'd live, and they comforted me.

2008: I was lonely yet again, but high school was over, and I was picking up what remained of my sanity after those four years of hell. I cursed my life. My inability to transition crippled me, and I saw no future. I saw nothing. I saw my death and all who had tortured me in school cracking one more joke at my expense. I looked at the reflection in the polished glass and I was not there, but a stranger who kept me going for reasons I still cannot fathom. Why did that man in the mirror not lay down and die?

2007: I was at my worst. I had stopped attending classes at high school, and I was an inpatient at a psychiatric hospital. Horrible things had been done to me for the three years prior to Christmas Day 2007, and I wanted to die, but society said no, that my day had not yet come, that I was too young to die so horribly and so lowly.

And today, we flash forward again, and it's Christmas Day 2012. I made it 5 years from high school to today. And I feel more whole than I have for as long as I can remember. I'm on estrogen and spironolactone, and I've made so many friends! Friends who have stuck by me through the hard times, and friends who touched my heart in ways too profound to speak of, and I wonder, I wonder: What will the next five years bring to me? I've finally started transitioning! I will have been on HRT for three months in but a few days, and I can actually see myself as I will be in five years, and by God, it's reassuring to be able to have that. I can see a life worth living now.

And so it was. Things did get better. I have many problems still, but my life is improving, and I choke back tears at what I've lost for today is not the day to shed those tears. Today is the day to celebrate how far we've all come. Have you started transitioning yet? Have you made new friends? Did you find a job? Did you reconcile with somebody you loved and lost? Celebrate being alive today. This is the season where it's typically cold outside, and so we huddle together for warmth around a fire, so talk about stuff here! Talk about your triumphs!

You see... one year ago I thought by this time I'll be in the Netherlands doing my ph.d. and being on HRT for some months, transitioning happily.

Sure, I'll be moving to Denmark in January, but it seems that wouldn't help much...Anyhow, after years of wishing that I'd wake up as a girl, and even something as a ""vision"" that it will happen someday, I'm stuck here trying to make the best of my life...And... the magic just does not happen, you just not transform over night.
