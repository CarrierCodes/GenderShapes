I'm 25.  When I was 21 I went to the NHS (UK) to start transition.  Since then they've been the literal minimal amount of helpful to stop me from walking away from them and going private.  First, they sent me a letter telling me to fuck off and die because the local authority was blocking funding for me to even talk to a specialist - way back when I was suicidal.

Since then, since I started living full time as female before I even got to them which the UK forces you to do before they'll treat you, they've had me on incredibly low doses of hormones; they only just started me on 2.5mg of finasteride three months ago, and even then only because my GP is really wonderful and has fought for me the whole way through.

That's four years of my life gone, and they're the years where my body starts to decay into something horrific and irredeemably male.  My mother's side of the family has male-pattern baldness and I have a receding hairline and *it didn't have to happen*, but because the NHS would rather people like us *died* they blocked treatment and slowed it down until my body could damage itself.

They didn't pay for hair removal, they didn't pay for sperm storage (about $600 / yr!), obv. they didn't pay for clothes, they're not paying for minoxidil.  All they're doing is *getting in my way* and *hurting* me, damaging me permanently.

I hate them.  I hate them.

Ever since I was a young teenager, I've always felt something was off about me.  I've always enjoyed being a guy, despite these feelings.

I had tried minor crossdressing, and it did make make me feel better occasionally, but I still felt that something was wrong. After a while I had begun to question if the feeling I was getting was not that I wanted to crossdress, but perhaps I was just finding some way of acting out within the abusive household I was in.  After a while this lost it's appeal, and I never did understand quite why. Though this did roughly coincide with the time I got out of that abusive situation.

I've since kept going, being your typical cisgender male, but I've still felt something was wrong, I would see a pretty girl and I would get feelings I really didn't understand.  I would be attracted to them, but I would also have some negative feeling alongside it. 

About a year ago, I started making sense of these feelings.  I was jealous.  I was jealous of the way their clothes fit, of the way thier body curves, of the way they moved. I began to think maybe I was transexual, maybe I was exhibiting a mild bit of gender dysphoria or something, which considering I would occasionally fantasize about being a woman could make some sense.  However I had no desire to go through any of surgeries or that type of thing.  But as I started to spend more time considering it, I started coming to more realizations.  

I like being a guy.  But I wouldn't mind being a girl, either.  If some magic or sci-fi event were to occur and I suddenly swapped genders, I would be perfectly fine with that, it'd be status quo from the other side of the isle.  However, the more time I spent thinking about this, the more I realized that even that wasn't quite true.  As I've said, I like being a guy, and being overwieght like I am, I've always had a bit of a body image issue. 

Recently I began to notice that despite my excessive weight, and otherwise cisgender attitudes, I didn't mind what the weight had done to my chest.  I'm ashamed of the fat in my stomach area, in my thighs, in my arms, and my face.  But I'm not ashamed of the chest.  There's something there, something that pushes out.  Regardless of how unnatural it would seem I was happy with my fat chest.  But even up until week ago I still had gone nowhere with this.

However, I had once again started questioning if there was something *wrong* with me.  Why was I pleased about this some days, and some days where I felt like I wanted to rip my own skin off.

[Then I saw this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12u481/1_year_and_hormones_later_i_have_never_felt_as/) and while there wasn't anything specific in that thread, I began looking into the transgender side of reddit.  /r/lgbt, /r/transgender, all the sidebar stuff.  The lists of resources, the faqs, the posts in the subreddits.

/r/genderqueer really resonated with me, and with it's related subreddits I finally began to see things that touched me in a place I didn't know existed.  I started asking myself new questions about my life, and suddenly, I was coming up with answers.  Not to everything, but these were answers to questions I had never even known where to start, so I've really started getting a new understanding of myself.

Suddenly my life started making more sense than it ever had before.  I had answers to old questions and I had new questions which were getting some answers too.  And that brings me to today.

I've had a lot of time over the last couple of days to be introspective.

I'm starting to learn who I am.  Sure, I still have far many more questions than I have answers. But I'm learning about me.  And I don't think I could've done it without you.

Sure, there are labels thrown around, and I feel I may adopt one or 2 of them at some point.  For now, I'm content to just know that there's both a place where people are asking the questions and finding the answers I'm starting to consider, or even questions I haven't thought of yet. And that there is a place where I can talk to others when I really don't know how to interpret something myself.

The point of all of this is... **Thank you.**  Thank you for being here for others.  Thank you for being here for youself.  Even if I'm new here thank you preemptively for being here for me.  Just... thank you to the entire community.

19,2012-11-12 07:58:06,131z0r,19,26,"I suppose I'm not sure where to put this.

I'm 21 years old.

When I was about seven or eight, I was in my parents car and we were on a road trip. For the following three or four hours, I had begun to experience the desire to imagine myself as a girl.  

This wasn't the first time this happened.  

One of my earliest memories is playing with my mom's wedding bouquet and pretending to be the bride at the wedding.  

And when I played with a cousin of mine, she wanted to be a princess in our make-believe games, but I too, wanted to be a princess.  
I had these adventure games with a friend, and I would often play a female character.  
I made my mom buy me a barbie when I was six.  

But what I wanted more than anything, was to wear that dress. The wedding dress, and to be a lady. Being called a girl always aroused me. In video games, I always played a girl if I could. I loved it when NPC would call me ""she"" or ""miss"" or ""milady"".  
I never liked conflict, and I would often shy away from it. I never liked fighting, and I only found it acceptable if it was a means to an end.  

I started crossdressing when I was fourteen or so. It started out just with bras and panties, but it quickly escalated to trying on all the clothes my mom had while nobody was home.  

I loved it.

I always wanted to be a girl. But I always found myself attracted to girls. I mean, I'm romantically attracted to girls, but sexually, I only want to do boys.  
I was always really submissive in my dreams as a lady.  
In my imagination, I thought I should serve a man, and if I did, I would be a good girl.  
I've been attracted to men, but my physical attraction to girls seems greater, or easier. I mean, I like girls. But not really in a sexual way that I like guys. I feel, however, that a guy could ask me out, and I would say yes even if I didn't think too much of him, so long as I thought he'd be a decent man.  

When I imagine myself with a man, I hate having a penis. I hate having male genitalia. I want to be a girl to him. I want to be a girl to me.  

My interests are a little boyish. I like sports and video games and computer stuff, but I want to be an artist for the rest of my life, even if I go to college for otherwise.  

I do my best to be androgynous in most of the things I do. I hate having to identify myself as a guy. I wish I could at least have no gender. Maybe that would feel fair.  
  
I keep day dreaming of being 'his' girlfriend.  

But I want to be a girl.  

I just ordered a set of bras and a wig off of ebay.  
I still live with my parents, but I plan on moving out into a big city next September.  
I'm nervous about these desires.  
Am I too late to become a girl?
Should I? I mean, would it actually make me happier?   
I mean... I'm not horribly depressed or anything. I'm not overtly dissatisfied with my life.  
I fear hurting my parents and the people who know me.  
So should I keep it a private thing?

-CFAB
-CMAB
-Trigger Warning
-Anti-oppression
-Gender-neutral (mostly referring to pronouns or bathrooms)
-How do you want me to refer to your body parts?
-You're being (insert oppressor here).
-Hetero-normative
-Oppression Olympics
-One of my hobbies is social justice."" / ""I'm really into social justice and crafting."" (or something equally inequitable like that)
-I think it's really important we talk about trans women.... okay, no you're totally right, sorry, I meant trans femmes.... CAMAB folks?... CAMAB/DMAB/Non-binary feminine folks? Non-masculine folks? Okay, fine, can we just not have every conversation be mostly about trans guys for once?""

-Shit, I forgot the acronym for that.
-Google it.
-What's your name, prefered pronoun, and favourite colour?
-Let's talk about intersectionality.
-Something about veganism.

Hi!

My name is Jaybird and I am genderqueer.  Gender is really interesting to me and my partner and I enjoy making a social experiment out of it.  When we decided to have a baby, I had the feeling it was going to be quite an adventure, so I decided to create a comic about it.  

It's been going for almost a year now and I would really like to expand my audience.  I try to be informative and inclusive, even if it ends up being sardonic.  I'm not a professional artist or cartoonist, but I hope I can help people, answer questions, and provoke conversation while providing a place for catharsis when I'm not working my crappy retail job.

Please check out [Platypuss!](http://platypusscomic.tumblr.com/) If you'd like, you can read it chronologically [here](http://platypusscomic.tumblr.com/tagged/platypuss/chrono) as well. 

I welcome and encourage questions and hope my first post on Reddit wasn't too much of a fail.

For context, some of my friends also know someone who is MtF, so they're already aware of Trans* issues in some way, although this is by no means the majority of my friends.

[EDIT: Well, I somehow convinced myself to hit post on Facebook. I'll let you know how it goes]

---The post------

This is the hardest thing I've ever had to write, and if you're reading this I consider you a friend; so it's time to be honest with you. My only request is that you don't share this with my family. They don't know, and they'll need their own explanation in time, in person.

I've been running and hiding. For so long I've denied who I am, but I know that you stuck with me through my ups and downs. Some of you may have suspected part of this, for others it will be totally out of left field. Either way if you have any questions feel free to comment, or message me, or ask me in person.

The short version is that I'm gender-queer. This means that I don't happily fit in as either a male or female. I'm happy presenting as male most of the time, But sometimes I want to be more feminine. When I have to I can go for months at a time being male and relatively happy, but I feel much more comfortable when I don't confine myself to presenting as male. So sometimes I may wear something feminine. Currently it's most likely to be shoes, but in the future, it could be more comprehensive. I hope to one day be able to present as entirely female, or at least androgynous when I choose. In the mean time I will look like a guy wearing some female stuff. And I'm fine with that. It's how I am. and I hope you will be fine with that too.

I've known something wasn't right for a long time. Definitely since I was about 11 or 12, although possibly earlier. I had occasional forays into exploring my gender, but I only started actually questioning myself properly in my first year of university. And now after 3 years of questioning and learning, I've accepted who I am. I'm not always a male. I'm not always a female. I am who I am. I'm happy with the name &lt;BirthName&gt;. I'm happy with being biologically male. But I'm also happy with presenting as female, or androgynous. I'm happy with male, female and gender-neutral pronouns. I am happy with wearing whatever clothes I feel like. I am happy with me.

The more I have uncovered, the more that has unraveled and I accept that it will be a long process to put everything back together.

Biologically, I am female, kept me in dresses and bangs until puberty hit.  Yet even then I had no definite grasp on myself or what I liked and disliked.  Coming to terms with my sexual attraction was one thing.  I identify as lesbian now because I am still viewed as female and it just makes things easier that way when it comes to explanations.

I am shifting and they have noticed that the ground around me becomes increasingly like sand.  Pretty soon we will all be washed out to sea and I seem to not care.*  

*They try to tether me but I shrug the binds off.  I smirk.  This is what I want, to be swept away and there is nothing to stop it.  Whatever lies beyond my understanding draws me in.  I want to be caught up in the sway, I want to be drenched in the unknown.*

*My dreams are harder to wake from these days.  Honestly, they are closer to memories and I cling to the afterthoughts like a child afraid of the monsters that lie outside of covers.  I wake and all I can wonder is who am I.  What is this body and why does this mind both reject and accept the fleshy confines.  Who am I to question such things.*

*I wish it didn't bother me, the wondering, but I cannot help this human trait.  I cannot help but to be absolutely bothered by my own existence.  Nothing makes sense and they just keep watching, waiting for me to make a move.  Pick a side.  I don't know where I belong though and that is the most troubling thing about this.*

65,2012-11-28 00:11:47,13wjes,9,4,"*I wasn't sure where to post this, this subreddit seemed like a welcoming enough and inclusive place to try out.*

I'm really attracted to androgynous, queer, and tomboy girls and dykes. Based on my experience, it's a physical and personality attraction. It's difficult for me to understand and articulate why.

I identify as a sex-positive ordinary heterosexual (0-1 on the Kinesy Scale, although I took a test once and [broke it](http://i.imgur.com/Rmm3a.jpg)) cis-male and I have a feminine cis-female girlfriend. My closest female bodied friends after my girlfriend happen to be bi and/or queer. I like breasts, vulvas, and butts of all sizes, and besides Josh Hartnett, I can't say I'm attracted to or interested in having an intimate relationship with a male-bodied person.

77,2012-11-30 05:43:49,141fq1,4,22,"&gt;I was cleaning out the blog (I don't use it anymore) and came across this from a few years back. You don't hear a whole lot of coming out stories around here, because it's kind of a hard topic to come out on. This was terrifying to write, but the response was overwhelming.

&gt; People were inquisitive, welcoming, proud and happy for me. I didn't have contact with the person who started the rumors in the first place. But I did hear she ended up losing some sleep and friends over people sick of her bullshit. It was a pretty great start to the year.

If you're here, you probably followed the link from Facebook. Allow me to first welcome you to my rarely-updated personal blog. Not that there's really anything here worth reading. But given the limited nature of a Facebook status update, I felt I could speak at greater length and more candidly here.

Yes, I have chosen to change my name to Cody. Yes it is more masculine, but also note that it is a unisex name close in sound to my previous name. Still there's been a fair bit of misinformation flying around that I feel compelled to clear up, as a result of my sudden preference for my ""more masculine"" name.

Just let me set straight now that I'm not transsexual, I'm not looking to change sexes, and I'm certainly not interested in any kind of surgery. What I am, however, is Genderqueer. This is a completely different kind of beast to transsexualism. Where a transsexual is someone who's gender identity is opposite to their physical sex, causing a dysphoria, Genderqueer is an umbrella term that encompasses those who's gender sits outside the commonly accepted binary.

What does that all mean? I like to walk a line that's in between what people choose to define as male or female, mostly because I feel that it's truer to how I identify myself. You see, a few years back I was told I was born with a particularly curious intersex condition that has left me a genetic chimera. That is to say I have both male (XY) and female (XX) genetic material in me. I don't especially want to get into the specific details of that. But the short of it is I'm still the person you know and love, just I'm choosing to live more closely to the genetic quirks I feel have helped define me as a person. It's not something I'm trying to hide, and I don't want to be treated any differently for it, especially since it's taken so long for me to redefine myself as something I can be proud of.

So I guess what I'm saying is, allow me to reintroduce myself now that I'm officially out of the proverbial closet that I seemed to have been stuck in for a while now. I'm Cody, still much like the [FRAY GIRL] you knew, just a happier individual looking to be proud of what she is. What I am is a genetically quirky genderqueer, not looking to make excuses for the things that make me happy. If people want to ask questions you can do so here, or on facebook, or email me at [POPULAR EMAIL SERVICE]. Honestly ask me anything, because I'm the kind of person who thinks that curiosity should be rewarded. If I can help you to better understand things, then it's a good outcome for both of us.

I guess I should make it my new years resolution to be more open about all of this. Unfortunately the misinformation can be quite damaging, making this kind of topic difficult, so it does make a world of difference to me that you clicked a link and took the time to understand me. So thank-you for obliging me and reading this verbose blog entry.

I hope 2010 finds you as well as it has me.

---

Ever since I was a young teenager, I've always felt something was off about me.  I've always enjoyed being a guy, despite these feelings.

I had tried minor crossdressing, and it did make make me feel better occasionally, but I still felt that something was wrong. After a while I had begun to question if the feeling I was getting was not that I wanted to crossdress, but perhaps I was just finding some way of acting out within the abusive household I was in.  After a while this lost it's appeal, and I never did understand quite why. Though this did roughly coincide with the time I got out of that abusive situation.

I've since kept going, being your typical cisgender male, but I've still felt something was wrong, I would see a pretty girl and I would get feelings I really didn't understand.  I would be attracted to them, but I would also have some negative feeling alongside it. 

About a year ago, I started making sense of these feelings.  I was jealous.  I was jealous of the way their clothes fit, of the way thier body curves, of the way they moved. I began to think maybe I was transexual, maybe I was exhibiting a mild bit of gender dysphoria or something, which considering I would occasionally fantasize about being a woman could make some sense.  However I had no desire to go through any of surgeries or that type of thing.  But as I started to spend more time considering it, I started coming to more realizations.  

I like being a guy.  But I wouldn't mind being a girl, either.  If some magic or sci-fi event were to occur and I suddenly swapped genders, I would be perfectly fine with that, it'd be status quo from the other side of the isle.  However, the more time I spent thinking about this, the more I realized that even that wasn't quite true.  As I've said, I like being a guy, and being overwieght like I am, I've always had a bit of a body image issue. 

Recently I began to notice that despite my excessive weight, and otherwise cisgender attitudes, I didn't mind what the weight had done to my chest.  I'm ashamed of the fat in my stomach area, in my thighs, in my arms, and my face.  But I'm not ashamed of the chest.  There's something there, something that pushes out.  Regardless of how unnatural it would seem I was happy with my fat chest.  But even up until week ago I still had gone nowhere with this.

However, I had once again started questioning if there was something *wrong* with me.  Why was I pleased about this some days, and some days where I felt like I wanted to rip my own skin off.

[Then I saw this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12u481/1_year_and_hormones_later_i_have_never_felt_as/) and while there wasn't anything specific in that thread, I began looking into the transgender side of reddit.  /r/lgbt, /r/transgender, all the sidebar stuff.  The lists of resources, the faqs, the posts in the subreddits.

/r/genderqueer really resonated with me, and with it's related subreddits I finally began to see things that touched me in a place I didn't know existed.  I started asking myself new questions about my life, and suddenly, I was coming up with answers.  Not to everything, but these were answers to questions I had never even known where to start, so I've really started getting a new understanding of myself.

Suddenly my life started making more sense than it ever had before.  I had answers to old questions and I had new questions which were getting some answers too.  And that brings me to today.

I've had a lot of time over the last couple of days to be introspective.

I'm starting to learn who I am.  Sure, I still have far many more questions than I have answers. But I'm learning about me.  And I don't think I could've done it without you.

Sure, there are labels thrown around, and I feel I may adopt one or 2 of them at some point.  For now, I'm content to just know that there's both a place where people are asking the questions and finding the answers I'm starting to consider, or even questions I haven't thought of yet. And that there is a place where I can talk to others when I really don't know how to interpret something myself.

The point of all of this is... **Thank you.**  Thank you for being here for others.  Thank you for being here for youself.  Even if I'm new here thank you preemptively for being here for me.  Just... thank you to the entire community.

20,2012-11-12 07:58:06,131z0r,19,26,"I suppose I'm not sure where to put this.

I'm 21 years old.

When I was about seven or eight, I was in my parents car and we were on a road trip. For the following three or four hours, I had begun to experience the desire to imagine myself as a girl.  

This wasn't the first time this happened.  

One of my earliest memories is playing with my mom's wedding bouquet and pretending to be the bride at the wedding.  

And when I played with a cousin of mine, she wanted to be a princess in our make-believe games, but I too, wanted to be a princess.  
I had these adventure games with a friend, and I would often play a female character.  
I made my mom buy me a barbie when I was six.  

But what I wanted more than anything, was to wear that dress. The wedding dress, and to be a lady. Being called a girl always aroused me. In video games, I always played a girl if I could. I loved it when NPC would call me ""she"" or ""miss"" or ""milady"".  
I never liked conflict, and I would often shy away from it. I never liked fighting, and I only found it acceptable if it was a means to an end.  

I started crossdressing when I was fourteen or so. It started out just with bras and panties, but it quickly escalated to trying on all the clothes my mom had while nobody was home.  

I loved it.

I always wanted to be a girl. But I always found myself attracted to girls. I mean, I'm romantically attracted to girls, but sexually, I only want to do boys.  
I was always really submissive in my dreams as a lady.  
In my imagination, I thought I should serve a man, and if I did, I would be a good girl.  
I've been attracted to men, but my physical attraction to girls seems greater, or easier. I mean, I like girls. But not really in a sexual way that I like guys. I feel, however, that a guy could ask me out, and I would say yes even if I didn't think too much of him, so long as I thought he'd be a decent man.  

When I imagine myself with a man, I hate having a penis. I hate having male genitalia. I want to be a girl to him. I want to be a girl to me.  

My interests are a little boyish. I like sports and video games and computer stuff, but I want to be an artist for the rest of my life, even if I go to college for otherwise.  

I do my best to be androgynous in most of the things I do. I hate having to identify myself as a guy. I wish I could at least have no gender. Maybe that would feel fair.  
  
I keep day dreaming of being 'his' girlfriend.  

But I want to be a girl.  

I just ordered a set of bras and a wig off of ebay.  
I still live with my parents, but I plan on moving out into a big city next September.  
I'm nervous about these desires.  
Am I too late to become a girl?
Should I? I mean, would it actually make me happier?   
I mean... I'm not horribly depressed or anything. I'm not overtly dissatisfied with my life.  
I fear hurting my parents and the people who know me.  
So should I keep it a private thing?

[EDIT: Well, I somehow convinced myself to hit post on Facebook. I'll let you know how it goes]

---The post------

This is the hardest thing I've ever had to write, and if you're reading this I consider you a friend; so it's time to be honest with you. My only request is that you don't share this with my family. They don't know, and they'll need their own explanation in time, in person.

I've been running and hiding. For so long I've denied who I am, but I know that you stuck with me through my ups and downs. Some of you may have suspected part of this, for others it will be totally out of left field. Either way if you have any questions feel free to comment, or message me, or ask me in person.

The short version is that I'm gender-queer. This means that I don't happily fit in as either a male or female. I'm happy presenting as male most of the time, But sometimes I want to be more feminine. When I have to I can go for months at a time being male and relatively happy, but I feel much more comfortable when I don't confine myself to presenting as male. So sometimes I may wear something feminine. Currently it's most likely to be shoes, but in the future, it could be more comprehensive. I hope to one day be able to present as entirely female, or at least androgynous when I choose. In the mean time I will look like a guy wearing some female stuff. And I'm fine with that. It's how I am. and I hope you will be fine with that too.

I've known something wasn't right for a long time. Definitely since I was about 11 or 12, although possibly earlier. I had occasional forays into exploring my gender, but I only started actually questioning myself properly in my first year of university. And now after 3 years of questioning and learning, I've accepted who I am. I'm not always a male. I'm not always a female. I am who I am. I'm happy with the name &lt;BirthName&gt;. I'm happy with being biologically male. But I'm also happy with presenting as female, or androgynous. I'm happy with male, female and gender-neutral pronouns. I am happy with wearing whatever clothes I feel like. I am happy with me.

Either way if you have any questions feel free to comment, or message me, or ask me in person.\n\nThe short version is that I'm gender-queer. This means that I don't happily fit in as either a male or female. I'm happy presenting as male most of the time, But sometimes I want to be more feminine. When I have to I can go for months at a time being male and relatively happy, but I feel much more comfortable when I don't confine myself to presenting as male. So sometimes I may wear something feminine. Currently it's most likely to be shoes, but in the future, it could be more comprehensive. I hope to one day be able to present as entirely female, or at least androgynous when I choose. In the mean time I will look like a guy wearing some female stuff. And I'm fine with that. It's how I am. and I hope you will be fine with that too.\n\nI've known something wasn't right for a long time. Definitely since I was about 11 or 12, although possibly earlier. I had occasional forays into exploring my gender, but I only started actually questioning myself properly in my first year of university. And now after 3 years of questioning and learning, I've accepted who I am. I'm not always a male. I'm not always a female. I am who I am. I'm happy with the name &lt;BirthName&gt;. I'm happy with being biologically male. But I'm also happy with presenting as female, or androgynous. I'm happy with male, female and gender-neutral pronouns. I am happy with wearing whatever clothes I feel like. I am happy with me.\n\nIf you've made it through that, thank you.

I wake and all I can wonder is who am I.  What is this body and why does this mind both reject and accept the fleshy confines.  Who am I to question such things.*

*I wish it didn't bother me, the wondering, but I cannot help this human trait.  I cannot help but to be absolutely bothered by my own existence.  Nothing makes sense and they just keep watching, waiting for me to make a move.  Pick a side.  I don't know where I belong though and that is the most troubling thing about this.*

I'm 25.  When I was 21 I went to the NHS (UK) to start transition.  Since then they've been the literal minimal amount of helpful to stop me from walking away from them and going private.  First, they sent me a letter telling me to fuck off and die because the local authority was blocking funding for me to even talk to a specialist - way back when I was suicidal.

86,2012-11-30 05:43:49,141fq1,4,22,"&gt;I was cleaning out the blog (I don't use it anymore) and came across this from a few years back. You don't hear a whole lot of coming out stories around here, because it's kind of a hard topic to come out on. This was terrifying to write, but the response was overwhelming.

&gt; People were inquisitive, welcoming, proud and happy for me. I didn't have contact with the person who started the rumors in the first place. But I did hear she ended up losing some sleep and friends over people sick of her bullshit. It was a pretty great start to the year.

If you're here, you probably followed the link from Facebook. Allow me to first welcome you to my rarely-updated personal blog. Not that there's really anything here worth reading. But given the limited nature of a Facebook status update, I felt I could speak at greater length and more candidly here.

Yes, I have chosen to change my name to Cody. Yes it is more masculine, but also note that it is a unisex name close in sound to my previous name. Still there's been a fair bit of misinformation flying around that I feel compelled to clear up, as a result of my sudden preference for my ""more masculine"" name.

Just let me set straight now that I'm not transsexual, I'm not looking to change sexes, and I'm certainly not interested in any kind of surgery. What I am, however, is Genderqueer. This is a completely different kind of beast to transsexualism. Where a transsexual is someone who's gender identity is opposite to their physical sex, causing a dysphoria, Genderqueer is an umbrella term that encompasses those who's gender sits outside the commonly accepted binary.

What does that all mean? I like to walk a line that's in between what people choose to define as male or female, mostly because I feel that it's truer to how I identify myself. You see, a few years back I was told I was born with a particularly curious intersex condition that has left me a genetic chimera. That is to say I have both male (XY) and female (XX) genetic material in me. I don't especially want to get into the specific details of that. But the short of it is I'm still the person you know and love, just I'm choosing to live more closely to the genetic quirks I feel have helped define me as a person. It's not something I'm trying to hide, and I don't want to be treated any differently for it, especially since it's taken so long for me to redefine myself as something I can be proud of.

So I guess what I'm saying is, allow me to reintroduce myself now that I'm officially out of the proverbial closet that I seemed to have been stuck in for a while now. I'm Cody, still much like the [FRAY GIRL] you knew, just a happier individual looking to be proud of what she is. What I am is a genetically quirky genderqueer, not looking to make excuses for the things that make me happy. If people want to ask questions you can do so here, or on facebook, or email me at [POPULAR EMAIL SERVICE]. Honestly ask me anything, because I'm the kind of person who thinks that curiosity should be rewarded. If I can help you to better understand things, then it's a good outcome for both of us.

I guess I should make it my new years resolution to be more open about all of this. Unfortunately the misinformation can be quite damaging, making this kind of topic difficult, so it does make a world of difference to me that you clicked a link and took the time to understand me. So thank-you for obliging me and reading this verbose blog entry.

I hope 2010 finds you as well as it has me.
