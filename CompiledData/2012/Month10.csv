So I went to get fast food before and I could tell the girl helping me wasn't sure what to think. I tried not to say much cuz my voice isn't very manly either.

Once at target I grabbed some pants and shirts and went towards the fitting rooms hoping no employees were out front, alas; there was a pregnant girl working there. I saw the girls rooms and didn't want to go in but then I didn't immediately see the guys and I thought they were in a different part of the store and I didn't want to ask cuz my voice and then she pointed me to the guys thank god (which was right next to me lol). Gave me some satisfaction that she pointed me there, and I had so much adrenaline flowing from the whole activity.
Anyway I tried on things like 5 times and decided on two jeans and a flanel. Now mind you I wasn't in guy mode but I was dressed so just for convenience's sake because I had time to shop tonight and I've been anxious to get clothes.

Obviously I was in girl mode and not really passing any way so I don't blame her for realizing I'm a girl, but I didn't want to be called out really, like it was my first time going out. And she's telling her girls not to judge people by their haircut and all this and I didn't know how to say I'm not just a girl.

(apologize for ma not perfect english).
Sometimes I'm confused in what I wanna be, so i just thought to write a little bit of my thoughts down. Maybe someone comments, if not, its good for me and other people to see that confused-ones like i have exist.

I'm ""male born"", having a more likely to be ""manly"" body.
""But"" I'm short, little bit young looking for my age of 21 and very very thin build.
I always had problems with looking ""feminine"" because most people told me a man looks more buff or stuff like this and as i was 11 i noticed i was more interested in ""boys"" than ""girls"".
The next 5 years i started to become a person who was not me, because i felt i wouldn't be accepted for what i was, mostly that i was a boy who liked boys.
with 15 i started to tell people that i'm gay outed myself blah blah blah (typical story)
i often thought the last years, in which i started to become more me (it was like i was born new with 15 and everything was new)
about maybe being transexual, because i like ""women"" clothing and women behaivour (the typical. ohgod). 
i started wearing some women clothes, first like ""full woman day"" and ""full man day"", till i noticed i could mix and this is nothing that i wanna change from one to another, because i'm me in both of this clothes.
in the last month i started to mix more and tryed many ""genderqueer"" outifts to create, problem was that like noone in this world is interested in this like me, I had 1 to 2 people to look up, but mostly I had to get it out of myself which was pretty hard.
In school and in most social activitys i can't wear my genderqueer clothes because most people do not understand me and i have like to have a security shield to put for my confused soul, because mostly the people who talk to me about this confuse me more than help me.
on many days i'm lucky with my appearence, but on some days i would like to dress different in public and i can't. and on this days this is hard for me, because it doesn't feel good to go out genderqueer because I have to make my security shield (can't just think to not use it, its not that easy) and it doesn't feel good to have on the wrong clothes or the wrong behaivour.
i'm not sure if i'm maybe more ""feminine"" than i show because i guess i'm oft frightened to show this side, because if i would have more of it, it would make things more complicated.
and after a long day of school with test and stuff i just don't have the power anymore to go through this things.
i know that gender is a construct, but for many people it's not that bad, for me more than for others i feel. and i'm tired to look up if i like stuff because people told me or if i like it myself.
it would be nice if i would get opinions, because i feel very alone in this topic.

For the last few days, I've been feeling very emotional and vulnerable, and I've been thinking a lot about my identity, my life, and where I'm going, and specifically I've been trying to think about gender identity and expression, and I just wrote this journal entry and wanted to share it.


**Monday, 8 October 2012, part 1**

Last night I couldn't help but think about gender, and in trying to understand my own gender identity.  I think I identify as genderqueer or dualgendered, two-spirited or fluid, or whatever way to describe that I don't feel strictly one way or another.  I have many times in the past found myself wishing I was female, more androgynous, that I was a lesbian trapped in a male body.  Sometimes I really wish I could change my sex at the push of a button.  I texted &lt;my friend&gt; to get her input.  Sometimes I feel like I'd like to see what hormone replacement was like, so I could understand how it affects my personality or if it would make me feel better or worse.  I've been thinking for some time now of some way I can express my femme, like painting my nails or shaving my legs or wearing a skirt.

**Monday, 8 October 2012, part 2**

I'm so gripped right now with trying to understand my own identity, and my gender identity in particular.  I've always fantasized about being the princess, the girl next door, I want to be the punk butch, the strong alpha female, the innocent naive girl, I want my image to reflect the way I want to express myself that day.  I've never defined myself as a male.  I think the world imprinted on me an image of what I should be, and I strove to become that image, but I've never felt that feeling come from somewhere inside me.  Of course I want things that might be considered masculine, I consider them human.  I want to protect my partner.  I want to provide for them and care for them, I want to be a good parent to my children.  Sometimes I do appreciate my male form, and I can put myself into that mindset, but it takes effort.  My natural state is somewhat in between.  I want to be held, I want to be nurtured, I want to be small, submissive, my male fantasies are all about being submissive, I imagine myself as female with a male.  I want to be able to feel deep emotional connection - I feel like I wish I looked more androgynous.  I wish I could change my physical form at will to reflect the way I felt inside and the way that it changes.  Someone I was chatting with online referred to me as a 'she', and I felt a little surge of excitement - my personality can be perceived as female.  I just wish my body could.  Past couple days have been very emotional for me.  I cried the other day just to do it.  I was watching something or listening to some music, and something made me sad and I just went with it.  I just wanted to feel my emotional self again.  I believe my life and upbringing, my attempt to fit that hypermasculine mold has crippled a part of me that I want back! I feel emotionally stunted, and I try and try and it's so difficult sometimes to connect to my own emotions and really understand them, and to communicate that to people and not bottle things up.

33,2012-10-10 06:44:24,118oz2,4,6,"Hi! Throwaway account, here. I just wanted everyone's advice on something. I've been experimenting recently with my gender expression. This involves me investing in some more masculine looking clothes. I've always been the type to wear T-shirts. I never really wear anything very masculine or feminine. But I guess I got sick of people perceiving me as a girl right away, because I'm agender. I just have a very feminine face or something?

But I've quickly discovered that I feel really.. awkward in men's clothing. Even when it really fits perfectly fine when I look at myself in the mirror. As soon as I leave the house I get uncomfortably aware of my ""feminine"" mannerisms. From the way I walk to the way I cross my legs when I sit or the way I slouch forward a bit in my seat. Has anyone else had this problem? I know gender identity is separate from expression, but what does it mean when I can't even dress in guy's clothes? Why do I feel so self conscious of my own feminine attributes? I don't get it. Another question I had is how long it took you to realize you're genderqueer. I'm going through this pretty late in life, and though a lot of things from my past make more sense now, it's strange to hear so many people say ""being called a girl/boy NEVER felt right to me"" or that they've always expressed themselves androgynously.

I\'ve always been the type to wear T-shirts. I never really wear anything very masculine or feminine. But I guess I got sick of people perceiving me as a girl right away, because I\'m agender. I just have a very feminine face or something?\n\nBut I\'ve quickly discovered that I feel really.. awkward in men\'s clothing. Even when it really fits perfectly fine when I look at myself in the mirror. As soon as I leave the house I get uncomfortably aware of my ""feminine"" mannerisms. From the way I walk to the way I cross my legs when I sit or the way I slouch forward a bit in my seat. Has anyone else had this problem? I know gender identity is separate from expression, but what does it mean when I can\'t even dress in guy\'s clothes? Why do I feel so self conscious of my own feminine attributes? I don\'t get it. Another question I had is how long it took you to realize you\'re genderqueer. I\'m going through this pretty late in life, and though a lot of things from my past make more sense now, it\'s strange to hear so many people say ""being called a girl/boy NEVER felt right to me"" or that they\'ve always expressed themselves androgynously.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Scale), made by Dr. Kinsey as a way to express sexual orientation as a gradient between straight and gay, rather than a binary.  It's a much more robust system than simply saying ""straight or gay"", but I still feel it's lacking in a number of ways. 

Namely, I see two areas where it is lacking: First, it fails to acknowledge that people have varying degrees of attraction overall (like asexuals) and not just varying objects of their attraction.  Second, it fails to differentiate between sex and gender with regards to attraction.  Maybe a person's self-identity is important to if you find them attractive, but their physical sex isn't, or visa versa.  Or possibly it's how masculine/feminine they are, regardless of either of the above factors.

I'd like to create a new scale/system for describing sexual orientation in a more inclusive/full way, and I'd like to get the opinion from the fine readers of /r/genderqueer.



Here's my ideas so far: basically, each person's sexual preference, rather than being represented by a number or a word, is best described by a matrix.  At it's most basic, it would be a 2x2 matrix like this:

    [A1 A2]
    [B1 B2]

You could have one of the axes (let's say the horizontal one) refer to sex while the other one refers to gender.  For example, say that everything in the left-hand row refers to someone who's physically female and everything in the right-hand row refers to someone who's physically male.  Then, everything in the top row refers to someone who identifies as male, and everything in the bottom row refers to someone who identifies as female.    So, if you're following me, A1 would be someone whose sex is female and gender identity is male.  A2 would be someone whose sex and gender identity are male.  B1 would be someone whose sex and Gender identity are female, and B2 would be someone whose sex is male and gender identity is female.  

Given this information, you can put a number (or possibly colour) into each of these cells to represent your level of interest in people that fit that description.  For example, if you only liked people whose gender identity is female, and can go either way on sex, your gender identity might go like this:

    [0 0]
    [8 8]


Conversely, if you only like people whose sex is female and can go either way for gender, then your matrix might look like this:

    [8 0]
    [7 0]

Both these people would describe themselves as liking women (based on the Kinsey scale), but they are, in a way, two very different sexual orientations.  Someone who's asexual, but romantically interested in everyone might have something like this:

    [2  2]
    [2  2]

Where-as someone who is only interested in people whose sex and gender are male, and who has a high sex drive would be more like this:

    [0  9]
    [0  0]

I'm thinking the scale should range from ""people in this group interest me about as much as your average rock"" to ""I would basically have sex with every single person in this group, if given the chance.""


Of course, the 2x2 matrix is the basic version.  You can make it more/less rows depending on how fine of a gradient you want it to be.  With gender, you would want to include people who feel completely separate from male and female, people who identify as feminine men, masculine women, etc.  For sex, you would want to make a space for intersex people as well as various points ways of transitioning for trans people.  Here's what a larger matrix might look like:

    [ A1  A2  A3  A4 ]  
    [ B1  B2  B3  B4 ]  
    [ C1  C2  C3  C4 ]  
    [ D1  D2  D3  D4 ]

This might well be something of a coming out, too, I don't know.

So, to start it out, I'm male. Have been all my life - I like my beard, I like my dick, I like everything about being a man. I don't have any desire to transition permanently, and I don't feel at all like I'm trapped in my own body - it's not really to do with visual identity, it feels more sexual.

I do like to cross dress - it started out with shoes, but it kind of moved over time, and it's becoming more and more prominent.

Anyways, for the past four or five years I've identified myself as bisexual, poly, kinky and a switch. Been fairly open about most of these and I'm surrounded by open and accepting friends at college right now which is great. So why not add another label to confuse people with right? 

For years my sister and closest friend have bugged me to dress up in drag for Halloween and for some reason this idea always made me really really embarrassed. I couldn't tell it then, but it was because the idea was rather appealing and I just didn't want to deal with it apparently. This year was the first year I decided to actually go along with the idea since my friend was going as a male for Halloween, we would have matching costumes. Sadly, the whole drag idea fell through when I didn't have enough time to get an outfit together, s.o instead I went as a lumberjack from Monty Python, complete with padded bra. 

The party was fun, but that wasn't what made me realize my genderqueerness. (If that is the right word.) While I was still in the planning phase of the costume, three customers at the store where I work mistook me for a woman (How that happened I have no idea, I'm a behemoth of a man with hair that is just starting to grow out.) Instead of making me feel embarrassed or peeved, I felt pleased. I distinctly remember thinking, ""Yes! It's working!"" and for the rest of my shift it was if I was walking on sunshine. That night, in an effort to be a bit more feminine I decided to shave a bunch of my body hair in the shower, something I've kept up to this day I enjoy the feeling so much. 

So I'm either genderqueer, fluid, bigender, or just have a giant fetish for crossdressing. One of those, not sure which yet. Still need to explore a bit, which brings me to my second and not as happy point.

I'm not in a good place to explore this at all currently. It's not my financial situation, my friends and family potentially rejecting me or anything like that, it's so ""First World Problems""-esque that I'm embarrassed to bring it up. I'm currently losing weight so quickly that it just doesn't make sense to buy any feminine clothing at all. Yup, ain't that a shame? 

It still leaves me with my hair, shoes and possibly makeup to play around with though. Not sure if I even want to play around with it until I'm smaller anyways. Must be impossibly hard for someone with a size 50 waist to experiment with clothing. I just worry though that if I don't start soon I'll miss out on my time to easily pass, or end up passing the time when HRT is feasible if I end up being trans.

As I have gotten older I discovered the genderqueer community and have accepted that I don't fit the gender norm of female.

* A couple months ago I was enjoying a summer swimming session in a public pool(albeit in a senior community) when an older man commented to his companions, ""I wish that guy would wear the right swimsuit."" I knew he was talking about me because I glanced over and they were all looking at me. I proceeded to go about my business alternating swimming in the pool and reading a book on the pool deck. The man continued to leer at me and every time I entered the pool the women would shoo their children to the other side of where I was and ignored me. Thankfully, one Canadian who I had earlier become acquainted with did come to my defense but I did feel edgy during the ordeal. I wasn't going to let an old, judgement, leering man keep me from enjoying a beautiful day with a nice book.

I have a boyfriend who I met online; who knows about my genderqueer status and loves me for who I am. I know he cares deeply for me

* Most days I am okay with my appearance but other days I am not. My boyfriend and I went to the grocery store recently - I was dressed in a casual sundress and platform sandals - we temporarily separated to tackle the grocery list. I headed down an isle and passed a little boy who I noticed out of the corner of my eye staring at me. I later met up with my boyfriend and I heard the little boy - who was behind me - reach his mother and say ""That's a man.""

Apparently we had parked near one another, as I helped put groceries into the car I noticed the mother watching me carefully as she helped her child into the car. I glanced over at her and she stiffened. Her face was a combination of mortification, embarrassment, and fear. I had done nothing to her and I felt that my appearance alone had terrorized her. I was upset on the way home but I couldn't bear to answer my boyfriend's questions as to why, so I just replied, ""People are jerks.""

On the other hand, I enjoy being able to do things a lot of more preppy women wouldn't dare to do. I go hiking with my boyfriend and his parents often. I weight lift and keep my body fit because I'm not afraid to sweat. I work hard and do well in subjects some women would call male-dominated fields like math, physics, and science.

In high school I would wear more masculine clothing and aimed to be mistaken for male. As I graduated I got into a relationship and aimed to be more feminine. A few years went by and I've questioned my love for androgyny, and if I was confused about being female. On days I loved being more masculine, but I didn't hate my feminine traits either. My mother is old fashioned, and pushed being more feminine since she noticed I would dress in mens clothing; she often joked I should have been born male. I have constant pressure from her to dress/act more feminine. I didn't know how to describe teeter tottering between both genders, or if I was stuck in the wrong body. After a conversation with a close and new friend, he put it to my attention that I might be genderqueer. I looked into it and finally feel comfort in something I can put a name to. 

So here I am now, I recently came out to my friends as being genderqueer, and am slowly rebuilding my wardrobe to something I've always dreamed of. I still have some things to learn, and I'm grateful for all my support. 

I just have a quick appearance question though. My wardrobe is filled with more feminine clothing, and I want to aim to be more androgynous. I posted a link to a few pictures and am wondering if I could get some tips on posture/facial expression/body language and any comments on being more androgynous. Given I love dressing up on days, some days I want to just be neutral.

I always had problems with looking ""feminine"" because most people told me a man looks more buff or stuff like this and as i was 11 i noticed i was more interested in ""boys"" than ""girls"".
The next 5 years i started to become a person who was not me, because i felt i wouldn't be accepted for what i was, mostly that i was a boy who liked boys.
with 15 i started to tell people that i'm gay outed myself blah blah blah (typical story)
i often thought the last years, in which i started to become more me (it was like i was born new with 15 and everything was new)
about maybe being transexual, because i like ""women"" clothing and women behaivour (the typical. ohgod). 
i started wearing some women clothes, first like ""full woman day"" and ""full man day"", till i noticed i could mix and this is nothing that i wanna change from one to another, because i'm me in both of this clothes.
in the last month i started to mix more and tryed many ""genderqueer"" outifts to create, problem was that like noone in this world is interested in this like me, I had 1 to 2 people to look up, but mostly I had to get it out of myself which was pretty hard.
In school and in most social activitys i can't wear my genderqueer clothes because most people do not understand me and i have like to have a security shield to put for my confused soul, because mostly the people who talk to me about this confuse me more than help me.
on many days i'm lucky with my appearence, but on some days i would like to dress different in public and i can't. and on this days this is hard for me, because it doesn't feel good to go out genderqueer because I have to make my security shield (can't just think to not use it, its not that easy) and it doesn't feel good to have on the wrong clothes or the wrong behaivour.
i'm not sure if i'm maybe more ""feminine"" than i show because i guess i'm oft frightened to show this side, because if i would have more of it, it would make things more complicated.
and after a long day of school with test and stuff i just don't have the power anymore to go through this things.
i know that gender is a construct, but for many people it's not that bad, for me more than for others i feel. and i'm tired to look up if i like stuff because people told me or if i like it myself.

For the last few days, I've been feeling very emotional and vulnerable, and I've been thinking a lot about my identity, my life, and where I'm going, and specifically I've been trying to think about gender identity and expression, and I just wrote this journal entry and wanted to share it.


**Monday, 8 October 2012, part 1**

Last night I couldn't help but think about gender, and in trying to understand my own gender identity.  I think I identify as genderqueer or dualgendered, two-spirited or fluid, or whatever way to describe that I don't feel strictly one way or another.  I have many times in the past found myself wishing I was female, more androgynous, that I was a lesbian trapped in a male body.  Sometimes I really wish I could change my sex at the push of a button.  I texted &lt;my friend&gt; to get her input.  Sometimes I feel like I'd like to see what hormone replacement was like, so I could understand how it affects my personality or if it would make me feel better or worse.  I've been thinking for some time now of some way I can express my femme, like painting my nails or shaving my legs or wearing a skirt.

**Monday, 8 October 2012, part 2**

I'm so gripped right now with trying to understand my own identity, and my gender identity in particular.  I've always fantasized about being the princess, the girl next door, I want to be the punk butch, the strong alpha female, the innocent naive girl, I want my image to reflect the way I want to express myself that day.  I've never defined myself as a male.  I think the world imprinted on me an image of what I should be, and I strove to become that image, but I've never felt that feeling come from somewhere inside me.  Of course I want things that might be considered masculine, I consider them human.  I want to protect my partner.  I want to provide for them and care for them, I want to be a good parent to my children.  Sometimes I do appreciate my male form, and I can put myself into that mindset, but it takes effort.  My natural state is somewhat in between.  I want to be held, I want to be nurtured, I want to be small, submissive, my male fantasies are all about being submissive, I imagine myself as female with a male.  I want to be able to feel deep emotional connection - I feel like I wish I looked more androgynous.  I wish I could change my physical form at will to reflect the way I felt inside and the way that it changes.  Someone I was chatting with online referred to me as a 'she', and I felt a little surge of excitement - my personality can be perceived as female.  I just wish my body could.  Past couple days have been very emotional for me.  I cried the other day just to do it.  I was watching something or listening to some music, and something made me sad and I just went with it.  I just wanted to feel my emotional self again.  I believe my life and upbringing, my attempt to fit that hypermasculine mold has crippled a part of me that I want back! I feel emotionally stunted, and I try and try and it's so difficult sometimes to connect to my own emotions and really understand them, and to communicate that to people and not bottle things up.

I think I identify as genderqueer or dualgendered, two-spirited or fluid, or whatever way to describe that I don't feel strictly one way or another.  I have many times in the past found myself wishing I was female, more androgynous, that I was a lesbian trapped in a male body.  Sometimes I really wish I could change my sex at the push of a button.  I texted &lt;my friend&gt; to get her input.  Sometimes I feel like I'd like to see what hormone replacement was like, so I could understand how it affects my personality or if it would make me feel better or worse.  I've been thinking for some time now of some way I can express my femme, like painting my nails or shaving my legs or wearing a skirt.\n\n**Monday, 8 October 2012, part 2**\n\nI'm so gripped right now with trying to understand my own identity, and my gender identity in particular.  I've always fantasized about being the princess, the girl next door, I want to be the punk butch, the strong alpha female, the innocent naive girl, I want my image to reflect the way I want to express myself that day.  I've never defined myself as a male.  I think the world imprinted on me an image of what I should be, and I strove to become that image, but I've never felt that feeling come from somewhere inside me.  Of course I want things that might be considered masculine, I consider them human.  I want to protect my partner.  I want to provide for them and care for them, I want to be a good parent to my children.  Sometimes I do appreciate my male form, and I can put myself into that mindset, but it takes effort.  My natural state is somewhat in between.  I want to be held, I want to be nurtured, I want to be small, submissive, my male fantasies are all about being submissive, I imagine myself as female with a male.  I want to be able to feel deep emotional connection - I feel like I wish I looked more androgynous.  I wish I could change my physical form at will to reflect the way I felt inside and the way that it changes.  Someone I was chatting with online referred to me as a 'she', and I felt a little surge of excitement - my personality can be perceived as female.  I just wish my body could.  Past couple days have been very emotional for me.  I cried the other day just to do it.  I was watching something or listening to some music, and something made me sad and I just went with it.  I just wanted to feel my emotional self again.  I believe my life and upbringing, my attempt to fit that hypermasculine mold has crippled a part of me that I want back! I feel emotionally stunted, and I try and try and it's so difficult sometimes to connect to my own emotions and really understand them, and to communicate that to people and not bottle things up.\n\n\nHere's where I stopped writing.

I'm sure many of you are familiar with the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_Scale), made by Dr. Kinsey as a way to express sexual orientation as a gradient between straight and gay, rather than a binary.  It's a much more robust system than simply saying ""straight or gay"", but I still feel it's lacking in a number of ways. 

Namely, I see two areas where it is lacking: First, it fails to acknowledge that people have varying degrees of attraction overall (like asexuals) and not just varying objects of their attraction.  Second, it fails to differentiate between sex and gender with regards to attraction.  Maybe a person's self-identity is important to if you find them attractive, but their physical sex isn't, or visa versa.  Or possibly it's how masculine/feminine they are, regardless of either of the above factors.

I'd like to create a new scale/system for describing sexual orientation in a more inclusive/full way, and I'd like to get the opinion from the fine readers of /r/genderqueer.



Here's my ideas so far: basically, each person's sexual preference, rather than being represented by a number or a word, is best described by a matrix.  At it's most basic, it would be a 2x2 matrix like this:

    [A1 A2]
    [B1 B2]

You could have one of the axes (let's say the horizontal one) refer to sex while the other one refers to gender.  For example, say that everything in the left-hand row refers to someone who's physically female and everything in the right-hand row refers to someone who's physically male.  Then, everything in the top row refers to someone who identifies as male, and everything in the bottom row refers to someone who identifies as female.    So, if you're following me, A1 would be someone whose sex is female and gender identity is male.  A2 would be someone whose sex and gender identity are male.  B1 would be someone whose sex and Gender identity are female, and B2 would be someone whose sex is male and gender identity is female.  

Given this information, you can put a number (or possibly colour) into each of these cells to represent your level of interest in people that fit that description.  For example, if you only liked people whose gender identity is female, and can go either way on sex, your gender identity might go like this:

    [0 0]
    [8 8]


Conversely, if you only like people whose sex is female and can go either way for gender, then your matrix might look like this:

    [8 0]
    [7 0]

Both these people would describe themselves as liking women (based on the Kinsey scale), but they are, in a way, two very different sexual orientations.  Someone who's asexual, but romantically interested in everyone might have something like this:

    [2  2]
    [2  2]

Where-as someone who is only interested in people whose sex and gender are male, and who has a high sex drive would be more like this:

    [0  9]
    [0  0]

I'm thinking the scale should range from ""people in this group interest me about as much as your average rock"" to ""I would basically have sex with every single person in this group, if given the chance.""


Of course, the 2x2 matrix is the basic version.  You can make it more/less rows depending on how fine of a gradient you want it to be.  With gender, you would want to include people who feel completely separate from male and female, people who identify as feminine men, masculine women, etc.  For sex, you would want to make a space for intersex people as well as various points ways of transitioning for trans people.  Here's what a larger matrix might look like:

    [ A1  A2  A3  A4 ]  
    [ B1  B2  B3  B4 ]  
    [ C1  C2  C3  C4 ]  
    [ D1  D2  D3  D4 ]

When I was little, I mean pre-puberty, I remember things.  Over the course of a couple hours I'd go from stuffing a training bra to shoving a sock in my underwear, from wanting to be a princess to wanting to be the prince that saved her.  I remember asking my mom what happened when two boys or two girls married each other.  I remember wanting to have a penis and boobs, I remember fantasizing about it.

It went to the wayside as I got older. I gained weight, became an outsider, stopped being active.  I started wearing men's clothes, cargo pants and shirts and cuffs and chains, then I got too big to wear cargo pants comfortably and gave in and started wearing women's jeans.  

I started writing gay characters, gay male characters, and it fit so well.  I hate writing females.  I guess now would be the time to mention I was born female.  I think about being a gay guy more than anything, I think about what it would be like to be in a gay relationship, and two summers ago I discovered the term girlfag.  A girl that identifies as a gay male.  That made so much sense to me.  I'd only ever had one boyfriend, and he lasted all of three weeks.  It was probably a good thing it didn't last longer, really.  

Last summer I broke down and went to the doc for anxiety meds, since I was losing sleep and eating my nails, the inside of my mouth (including cheeks, lips, and tongue), and the skin around my nails.  I got medicine, but refused to get a therapist, then I stopped taking the meds altogether because if I keep taking them then I would have to go to a therapist, which scares the hell out of me for some reason I can't quite define.  

I found genderqueer a few months ago and realized that defines me pretty well.  I like my long hair and sometimes my boobs, but I'd love to be a guy from the waist down.  But sometimes I like the idea of looking good and curvy in a pair of jeans.  I'm losing weight, which is good.

Then a couple weeks ago I got a new toy and decided to try it out and pulled up a video from r/gayporn.  Then I started crying, because I wanted what the guys in the video have.  Now I'm wondering if I'm trans, because I've got no idea, and I'm telling myself to wait until I've lost the weight I want to lose before making any decisions, and now here I am rambling on to you guys.

So, to start it out, I'm male. Have been all my life - I like my beard, I like my dick, I like everything about being a man. I don't have any desire to transition permanently, and I don't feel at all like I'm trapped in my own body - it's not really to do with visual identity, it feels more sexual.

I do like to cross dress - it started out with shoes, but it kind of moved over time, and it's becoming more and more prominent. There are times where I just feel...well, girly is the term I use, where I want to act like a girl, dress like a girl, be seen as sexy. I have a girlfriend, who I love a hell of a lot, and she knows I like to dress up.

Anyways, for the past four or five years I've identified myself as bisexual, poly, kinky and a switch. Been fairly open about most of these and I'm surrounded by open and accepting friends at college right now which is great. So why not add another label to confuse people with right? 

For years my sister and closest friend have bugged me to dress up in drag for Halloween and for some reason this idea always made me really really embarrassed. I couldn't tell it then, but it was because the idea was rather appealing and I just didn't want to deal with it apparently. This year was the first year I decided to actually go along with the idea since my friend was going as a male for Halloween, we would have matching costumes. Sadly, the whole drag idea fell through when I didn't have enough time to get an outfit together, s.o instead I went as a lumberjack from Monty Python, complete with padded bra. 

The party was fun, but that wasn't what made me realize my genderqueerness. (If that is the right word.) While I was still in the planning phase of the costume, three customers at the store where I work mistook me for a woman (How that happened I have no idea, I'm a behemoth of a man with hair that is just starting to grow out.) Instead of making me feel embarrassed or peeved, I felt pleased. I distinctly remember thinking, ""Yes! It's working!"" and for the rest of my shift it was if I was walking on sunshine. That night, in an effort to be a bit more feminine I decided to shave a bunch of my body hair in the shower, something I've kept up to this day I enjoy the feeling so much. 

So I'm either genderqueer, fluid, bigender, or just have a giant fetish for crossdressing. One of those, not sure which yet. Still need to explore a bit, which brings me to my second and not as happy point.

I'm not in a good place to explore this at all currently. It's not my financial situation, my friends and family potentially rejecting me or anything like that, it's so ""First World Problems""-esque that I'm embarrassed to bring it up. I'm currently losing weight so quickly that it just doesn't make sense to buy any feminine clothing at all. Yup, ain't that a shame? 

It still leaves me with my hair, shoes and possibly makeup to play around with though. Not sure if I even want to play around with it until I'm smaller anyways. Must be impossibly hard for someone with a size 50 waist to experiment with clothing. I just worry though that if I don't start soon I'll miss out on my time to easily pass, or end up passing the time when HRT is feasible if I end up being trans. Not sure where I'm ending up with this so I want to keep it all open.

Thanks for listening to my ramblings. Or reading them. Or skimming them. Any of those.

Here's the thing. My girlfriend and I are both very into bondage and other forms of BDSM. She's incredibly submissive in the bedroom, and to a much lesser extent outside of it. When I'm feeling more masculine, this is totally fine, and I have no problem dominating her, tying her up, or whatever, and we're both really enjoying it. However, on days when I'm feeling more feminine, I find the idea of being dominant much less interesting, and want to be the submissive one. Like, seriously submissive. I haven't told anyone about this, because I'm worried people will dismiss me and say I'm simply fetishizing aspects of whichever gender I'm currently identifying as, because how I feel when I'm masculine or feminine happens to line up with the stereotypes for male/female gender roles with regards to bdsm and bondage.

My gripe with this is that I do not think I HAVE any disorder or disease in regards to me severely disliking a part of my body, which has been apparent for me since puberty (I would wear layered camisoles or shirts to flatten my chest - even through high school and now that I am almost done with college I only wear sports bras and I'm thinking about getting a binder). Aside from my breasts, I am fine with my female anatomy and I do not wish to be a male. I dress more androgynous and I only wish to look more androgynous for myself. However, I would consider myself to be very less feminine than anyone I have met. I was always a tom boy growing up and even though I wear make-up and have dresses and high heels I only have them so that I can come off as feminine to others even though I don't want to (I HATE HATE HATE that, not sure why I do it). I also do not have many female friends, if any. I just simply cannot relate to other women. I do not want to have children nor do I like them, I despise getting my period, I do not show cleavage or any sex appeal associated with femininity. I do have long hair which I don't feel like cutting because it's easier to maintain and I like it, as a result I do not want to come off butch (have nothing against it!) but, like I mentioned, would prefer to come off as a more androgynous girl though I do not feel comfortable being a female.

Now with all this comes another issue: I am in fact attracted to men. I have only dated men and have had only sexual encounters with men. I find other women to be pretty or beautiful, but I'm not sure I am attracted to them sexually. If anything, there are times where I see a girl that is androgynous looking and think: ""She's really cute! I wish I looked like her."" However, if I found another girl just like me (more on the masculine side) I would not be opposed to have a relationship. Regardless, I prefer men but I'm constantly fearing that if I do in fact come out as agender or gender queer or genderfluid - I won't be able to find a man that will appreciate me for ME, let alone a woman that prefers to be a bit masculine (because hey, wouldn't that make them a little gay?). I'm sick of men treating me as an object to attain and/or use, I guess that's why I haven't found the right 'one' nor do I think I ever will... which to be honest, scares me to death.


I'm just confused with this life long battle of identity of mine and I'm a bit upset that individuals would say I have self-esteem issues or body dysmorphia issues.

As I have gotten older I discovered the genderqueer community and have accepted that I don't fit the gender norm of female.

* A couple months ago I was enjoying a summer swimming session in a public pool(albeit in a senior community) when an older man commented to his companions, ""I wish that guy would wear the right swimsuit."" I knew he was talking about me because I glanced over and they were all looking at me. I proceeded to go about my business alternating swimming in the pool and reading a book on the pool deck. The man continued to leer at me and every time I entered the pool the women would shoo their children to the other side of where I was and ignored me. Thankfully, one Canadian who I had earlier become acquainted with did come to my defense but I did feel edgy during the ordeal. I wasn't going to let an old, judgement, leering man keep me from enjoying a beautiful day with a nice book.

I have a boyfriend who I met online; who knows about my genderqueer status and loves me for who I am. I know he cares deeply for me

* Most days I am okay with my appearance but other days I am not. My boyfriend and I went to the grocery store recently - I was dressed in a casual sundress and platform sandals - we temporarily separated to tackle the grocery list. I headed down an isle and passed a little boy who I noticed out of the corner of my eye staring at me. I later met up with my boyfriend and I heard the little boy - who was behind me - reach his mother and say ""That's a man."" As I went down another aisle, I saw a bunch of sunburned men pointing down the isle at me and laughing manically; since I was the only person in the whole aisle, I can only assume they were laughing at me. As we checked out, I went to the RedBox DVD rental kiosk and searched for a movie. A black lady and her daughter were behind me and the daughter (about 4 years old) proclaimed loudly, ""Mommy, why is that Man wearing a Dress?"" The woman appropriately told her daughter to be quiet and I went about my way. As my boyfriend and I headed to the car the same mother and daughter duo headed out as well. Apparently we had parked near one another, as I helped put groceries into the car I noticed the mother watching me carefully as she helped her child into the car. I glanced over at her and she stiffened. Her face was a combination of mortification, embarrassment, and fear. I had done nothing to her and I felt that my appearance alone had terrorized her. I was upset on the way home but I couldn't bear to answer my boyfriend's questions as to why, so I just replied, ""People are jerks.""

*I felt beautiful in the outfit that I wore to the grocery store but the three separate incidents made me feel awful. It's times like those that make me want to go speak to a plastic surgeon. I would rather look like an ugly woman than a man wearing a dress. I'm considering talking to a surgeon about FFS (facial feminization surgery).*

On the other hand, I enjoy being able to do things a lot of more preppy women wouldn't dare to do. I go hiking with my boyfriend and his parents often. I weight lift and keep my body fit because I'm not afraid to sweat. I work hard and do well in subjects some women would call male-dominated fields like math, physics, and science.

The purpose of this space is to foster the emerging culture that is centered on the needs, concerns, thoughts, and feelings of those who don't ascribe to a binary definition of sexual-orientation. In broader terms, it is also a place for people to explore the gray areas when it comes to human gender identity. There are already subreddits that deal with similar issues (r/bisexual, r/bisexualadults, and r/genderqueer), but there is no subreddit prepared to meet the needs of people who are nonbinary in both aspects.

Who's welcome here? Anyone. Everyone. People who need to find their cultural center and those who want to learn more about bisexual/omnisexual/pansexual/asexual/demisexual/etc culture and how it might different from straight, gay, and lesbian cultural groups.

In high school I would wear more masculine clothing and aimed to be mistaken for male. As I graduated I got into a relationship and aimed to be more feminine. A few years went by and I've questioned my love for androgyny, and if I was confused about being female. On days I loved being more masculine, but I didn't hate my feminine traits either. My mother is old fashioned, and pushed being more feminine since she noticed I would dress in mens clothing; she often joked I should have been born male. I have constant pressure from her to dress/act more feminine. I didn't know how to describe teeter tottering between both genders, or if I was stuck in the wrong body. After a conversation with a close and new friend, he put it to my attention that I might be genderqueer. I looked into it and finally feel comfort in something I can put a name to. 

So here I am now, I recently came out to my friends as being genderqueer, and am slowly rebuilding my wardrobe to something I've always dreamed of. I still have some things to learn, and I'm grateful for all my support. 

I just have a quick appearance question though. My wardrobe is filled with more feminine clothing, and I want to aim to be more androgynous. I posted a link to a few pictures and am wondering if I could get some tips on posture/facial expression/body language and any comments on being more androgynous. Given I love dressing up on days, some days I want to just be neutral.

- nothing is written in stone

- a large and ponderous rule set in very specific situation such as this (a subset of a larger whole with its own ruleset, focused around a specific topic) is off putting to many and destructive to participation and freedom in general.

Here, we discuss content 'rules': what is an allowable post, what is a bannable offense, what is unwelcome, etc.

First, everyone should be acquainted with the reddit user agreement, privacy policy, and reddiquette as a function of participation on reddit, these provide solid guidelines for 99% of both moderation and content issues.

Basic content guidelines specific to /r/transgender:

- Do not post porn, or provide links that service the porn industry directly or indirectly. You may post relevant nsfw content if marked as nsfw, but be aware of the preceding. A corollary of this is no soliciting -- of a sexual(or otherwise) nature.

- This a free speech area, and open discussion is encouraged, with caveats. Sexism, racism, and similar ism-ing are not acceptable (check your privilege...). Speak your mind, but word your arguments with a consideration of other's perspectives.

- Do not post personal identifying information, not about you not about anyone you know e.g. addresses, phone numbers, etc.

- Do not post links asking for donations.

Specific content guidelines:

- Any sort of question about X (Who is X? Where is X? What is X? When is X? How is X? Why is X?) in a transgender context should go to /r/asktransgender, a space specific to asking and answering questions for all transgender or cisgender perspectives.

Image Guidelines:

- Links to images/photographs are evaluated on a case by case basis; each submission is judged on its contribution to r/transgender. 

- Images/macros are valued if they make valid contribution or have a perspective that will interest an audience for the topic here.

- Photographs must satisfy an evolving and arguable transgender visibility criteria that relates the image to the larger social structure and culture the the photo exists within. 

- Do not post photos you have taken of your self. This includes all form of phone-camera-mirror self shots, and cam pictures of you at your computer. Timelines of a substantial documentation and time period (e.g. &gt;10 photos over at least a year) may be excepted. 

- Do not post photos with faces cropped out, covered, blurred or obscured in any way.

- Do not post photos asking for a personal evaluation of any criteria (e.g. 'Do I pass?', 'What do you think of this outfit?') or vague statements aimed at garnering attention (e.g. 'The best cure for the blues is to put on 20 pounds of makeup!').
