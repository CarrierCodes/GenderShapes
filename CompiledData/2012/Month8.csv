This morning I imagined another person's voice coming out of my mouth and almost started crying. It wasn't anyone that I knew. I just invented the sound.

""That's me,"" I thought to myself; ""that sounds just like me.""

I thought it would be interesting to imagine a feminine twist to my words.

My eyes were wet, but I didn't really cry. It's not right for a *man* to cry in public - especially while everyone around you is riffing off the music. I can enjoy the music too. I can smile.

*Smile*, God dammit.

Last night, I went to bed feeling tired and masculine. I had spent part of the evening talking about my bicycle - I learnt to fix it, the past week - and I spent the rest playing Guitar Hero or card games with other *men*.

I was Moosejaw, and I made a point of the fact I looked like a hobo. Everyone laughed.

And it was right.

I traded the bass off, for a while, to somebody that had never played. He said he could play Hysteria on Expert. He's got this. I walked around a bit, after explaining how the controller worked, (and selecting Easy without him noticing until afterwards). I came back after a few songs and asked if anyone was getting bored.

""Not really,"" the guitarist said. ""You wouldn't want to be a girl anyway.""

Not right then, no. Mostly. Some.

I said, I thought women and *men* were both perfectly fine human beings.

When I was a child, sometimes I would think I was a lesbian. I mean, it was a perfectly rational sort of reasoning, even if it was based off of faulty premises. ""I think I'm probably actually a girl. But I like girls. I think I like girls [I like being normal] more than I'd like being a girl. But I think you can have both? I think that's called being a lesbian. I guess I'm a lesbian, then.""

I never thought you could like both, or neither, or everyone - or you could be both, or neither, or either, or another. It never occurred to me that sometimes I didn't feel that way - that I was normal, at times. I thought the gender binary and your preferences were set in stone. I didn't always think much of it, and I didn't often think much of myself after that afternoon. I knew what people though of lesbians. I wasn't able to speak my mind of the issue. There would be problems.

It never even occurred to me that people wouldn't believe me when I say I am what I'm not. Perfect childhood reasoning, albeit without perfect assumptions or premises.

I always loved things that were split in half. A childhood, imagined super-person: a man who could take anything mechanical or biological, and incorporate it into his own body. The only comic book character I ever paid any mind at all to: Batman's Two-Face. Men and women that would dress up half in their gender's clothes, half in the other's - both piecemeal and [not](http://i.imgur.com/75P1Q.jpg). Drag queens, when I learned about them.

And the people that had more courage than I did.

I like all clothes. I know I'm missing a couple important parts and have a bit of a disproportionate body to be able to use most of the options, and I've always known that will be true. I wished it wasn't.

Once, I wondered if there was some drug or surgery I could have done that would make me always ambiguous, and avoid puberty, at the cost of most anything. Then I learned eunuchs aren't ambiguous, they're just eunuchs. And I was poor anyway.

And my parents would disagree, saying I'm interested in self-mutilation, trying to treat me instead of work with me. I knew that wasn't the right thing to do. Even a delay would be wrong and expensive.

Recovery through therapy is more important than completion. And I wouldn't even get that, of course, just a stern talking-to. It's hard being poor.

Some days I wonder what I am, still. I've been comfortable with every label at one point or another, although I've never shared that with anyone I really know.

I always get jealous of the pretty girls with great figures, I always feel a little bummed that I don't have real breasts or a vagina, but I also always love my penis.

39,2012-08-16 12:50:08,ybg3n,15,7,"I am a bit excited right now, and a bit confused, and worried.  I usually put these thoughts on the back burner because I know that labels don't NEED to be assigned to things, but after reading a bunch of this reddit, definitions, I feel like I'd really like some insight.

So I am a 26 year old female.  I have been interested in girls since I was about 7, and my first experience with one was at that age and she was the same age as me.   
As I went through puberty I knew I liked guys too.  I was certain I liked males but I wasn't positive about females although I could not stop fantasizing about them, only in my fantasies I usually had a penis or was in another guys body fucking her!  Finally in my early adulthood I got to experience a few women, manly ones and girly ones, and realized I was most certainly bi-sexual, but I am still nervous as hell around women I am attracted to and it has greatly impeded my self confidence in even beginning to try out a real relationship with one.  Until the last two years, being in a heterosexual relationship with someone whos sex drive is MUCH lower than mine, I have spent a lot of time experimenting with myself, him, and my feelings about sexuality.  I remember being very attracted to cross dressers and (edited) transsexuals when I used to go to gay bars back in Canada (I live in the USA now), but I think all of them were into men as no one seemed to take my advances seriously.  I seem to be pansexual in that reguard...I think?  And then, I still fantasize about being with women as a man with a penis, but I never really THOUGHT about it until recently when my boyfriend took my very accurate looking penis dildo, placed it on my crotch and began to suck it as if it was my dick.  I hadn't been that turned on in a long time.  Now he likes when I experiment on him with anal, which is also arousing, but I feel so flexible now.  I have always been the submissive one, sometimes brutally so, and I love it.  Am I genderqueer?  lol.  I dressed like a boy when I was a kid, and only hung out with boys, and did boy things.  99% of my friends are still all guys, and the girls I maintain friendships with are always a bit dominant and masculine themselves.  Hitting puberty I think fucked it up.  Like I was too young to register the fact that society was pushing me into a gender roll that I didn't necessarily feel inside of myself.  I love being feminine, in dress and makeup, but there is this repressed masculinity in me I feel.  Not sure how to deal with it.

I usually put these thoughts on the back burner because I know that labels don't NEED to be assigned to things, but after reading a bunch of this reddit, definitions, I feel like I'd really like some insight.\n\nSo I am a 26 year old female.  I have been interested in girls since I was about 7, and my first experience with one was at that age and she was the same age as me.   \nAs I went through puberty I knew I liked guys too.  I was certain I liked males but I wasn't positive about females although I could not stop fantasizing about them, only in my fantasies I usually had a penis or was in another guys body fucking her!  Finally in my early adulthood I got to experience a few women, manly ones and girly ones, and realized I was most certainly bi-sexual, but I am still nervous as hell around women I am attracted to and it has greatly impeded my self confidence in even beginning to try out a real relationship with one.  Until the last two years, being in a heterosexual relationship with someone whos sex drive is MUCH lower than mine, I have spent a lot of time experimenting with myself, him, and my feelings about sexuality.  I remember being very attracted to cross dressers and (edited) transsexuals when I used to go to gay bars back in Canada (I live in the USA now), but I think all of them were into men as no one seemed to take my advances seriously.  I seem to be pansexual in that reguard...I think?  And then, I still fantasize about being with women as a man with a penis, but I never really THOUGHT about it until recently when my boyfriend took my very accurate looking penis dildo, placed it on my crotch and began to suck it as if it was my dick.  I hadn't been that turned on in a long time.  Now he likes when I experiment on him with anal, which is also arousing, but I feel so flexible now.  I have always been the submissive one, sometimes brutally so, and I love it.  Am I genderqueer?  lol.  I dressed like a boy when I was a kid, and only hung out with boys, and did boy things.  99% of my friends are still all guys, and the girls I maintain friendships with are always a bit dominant and masculine themselves.  Hitting puberty I think fucked it up.  Like I was too young to register the fact that society was pushing me into a gender roll that I didn't necessarily feel inside of myself.  I love being feminine, in dress and makeup, but there is this repressed masculinity in me I feel.  Not sure how to deal with it.  \n  \nAlso, I have a whole bunch of questions to one day ask about my boyfriend.  I won't even get into that now.\n  \nAnyways, this was a rant I guess.

I have in a guy's term 'kick ass facial hair' when it grows in, which is sort of ironic cause I don't want it and some around me can't grow full beards.

And as such, it's hard to even consider asking people to use neutral pronouns, because I know it'd lead to explanations and prejudice and the like on a near-daily basis, and I don't know if I could handle that at all.

This morning I imagined another person's voice coming out of my mouth and almost started crying. It wasn't anyone that I knew. I just invented the sound.

""That's me,"" I thought to myself; ""that sounds just like me.""

I thought it would be interesting to imagine a feminine twist to my words.

My eyes were wet, but I didn't really cry. It's not right for a *man* to cry in public - especially while everyone around you is riffing off the music. I can enjoy the music too. I can smile.

*Smile*, God dammit.

Last night, I went to bed feeling tired and masculine. I had spent part of the evening talking about my bicycle - I learnt to fix it, the past week - and I spent the rest playing Guitar Hero or card games with other *men*.

I was Moosejaw, and I made a point of the fact I looked like a hobo. Everyone laughed.

And it was right.

I traded the bass off, for a while, to somebody that had never played. He said he could play Hysteria on Expert. He's got this. I walked around a bit, after explaining how the controller worked, (and selecting Easy without him noticing until afterwards). I came back after a few songs and asked if anyone was getting bored.

""Not really,"" the guitarist said. ""You wouldn't want to be a girl anyway.""

Not right then, no. Mostly. Some.

I said, I thought women and *men* were both perfectly fine human beings.

When I was a child, sometimes I would think I was a lesbian. I mean, it was a perfectly rational sort of reasoning, even if it was based off of faulty premises. ""I think I'm probably actually a girl. But I like girls. I think I like girls [I like being normal] more than I'd like being a girl. But I think you can have both? I think that's called being a lesbian. I guess I'm a lesbian, then.""

I never thought you could like both, or neither, or everyone - or you could be both, or neither, or either, or another. It never occurred to me that sometimes I didn't feel that way - that I was normal, at times. I thought the gender binary and your preferences were set in stone. I didn't always think much of it, and I didn't often think much of myself after that afternoon. I knew what people though of lesbians. I wasn't able to speak my mind of the issue. There would be problems.

It never even occurred to me that people wouldn't believe me when I say I am what I'm not. Perfect childhood reasoning, albeit without perfect assumptions or premises.

I always loved things that were split in half. A childhood, imagined super-person: a man who could take anything mechanical or biological, and incorporate it into his own body. The only comic book character I ever paid any mind at all to: Batman's Two-Face. Men and women that would dress up half in their gender's clothes, half in the other's - both piecemeal and [not](http://i.imgur.com/75P1Q.jpg). Drag queens, when I learned about them.

And the people that had more courage than I did.

I like all clothes. I know I'm missing a couple important parts and have a bit of a disproportionate body to be able to use most of the options, and I've always known that will be true. I wished it wasn't.

Once, I wondered if there was some drug or surgery I could have done that would make me always ambiguous, and avoid puberty, at the cost of most anything. Then I learned eunuchs aren't ambiguous, they're just eunuchs. And I was poor anyway.

And my parents would disagree, saying I'm interested in self-mutilation, trying to treat me instead of work with me. I knew that wasn't the right thing to do. Even a delay would be wrong and expensive.

Recovery through therapy is more important than completion. And I wouldn't even get that, of course, just a stern talking-to. It's hard being poor.

Some days I wonder what I am, still. I've been comfortable with every label at one point or another, although I've never shared that with anyone I really know.

So I'm a *man* for them. It pays the best. And I can donate all I earn to charity, which will help someone who can figure themselves out.",genderqueer,Please ignore me.

36,2012-08-14 10:36:40,y738c,18,17,"Hey,

So I've been identifying myself as bigender or dualgender for a while now, I'm biologically male, late twenties.  I was on /r/DualGender, which I hadn't gone to until a month or so ago, but I haunt /r/genderqueer all the time, and the DG people were mentioning 'phases' a lot.  Girl phase, guy phase.  This sort of makes sense to me but I personally hadn't heard of that or thought of it that way before.  

I just wanted to ask you all what you thought.  I feel pretty much like I'm both, pretty much all the time.  Man and Woman, all the time.  I always get jealous of the pretty girls with great figures, I always feel a little bummed that I don't have real breasts or a vagina, but I also always love my penis.  I always wish I could switch back and forth whenever I wanted.  Granted when I dress like a woman I feel more like a woman, so if anything that might be a phase.  But I sort of always feel like a man on the outside and a woman on the inside and also a woman on the outside and a man on the inside (depending on my presentation.)  Anyone else relate to this?  Is there a different term than bigender that I should look into?  I know that I'm just who I am at the end of the day, but I enjoy the community of knowing the ""right"" label.  

DualSpirit is how I feel.  Like my soul or what have you is male and female simultaneously.  I just wish it were possible to make my body able to switch back and forth as fluidly (as I know many of us do.)

I usually put these thoughts on the back burner because I know that labels don't NEED to be assigned to things, but after reading a bunch of this reddit, definitions, I feel like I'd really like some insight.

So I am a 26 year old female.  I have been interested in girls since I was about 7, and my first experience with one was at that age and she was the same age as me.   
As I went through puberty I knew I liked guys too.  I was certain I liked males but I wasn't positive about females although I could not stop fantasizing about them, only in my fantasies I usually had a penis or was in another guys body fucking her!  Finally in my early adulthood I got to experience a few women, manly ones and girly ones, and realized I was most certainly bi-sexual, but I am still nervous as hell around women I am attracted to and it has greatly impeded my self confidence in even beginning to try out a real relationship with one.  Until the last two years, being in a heterosexual relationship with someone whos sex drive is MUCH lower than mine, I have spent a lot of time experimenting with myself, him, and my feelings about sexuality.  I remember being very attracted to cross dressers and (edited) transsexuals when I used to go to gay bars back in Canada (I live in the USA now), but I think all of them were into men as no one seemed to take my advances seriously.  I seem to be pansexual in that reguard...I think?  And then, I still fantasize about being with women as a man with a penis, but I never really THOUGHT about it until recently when my boyfriend took my very accurate looking penis dildo, placed it on my crotch and began to suck it as if it was my dick.  I hadn't been that turned on in a long time.  Now he likes when I experiment on him with anal, which is also arousing, but I feel so flexible now.  I have always been the submissive one, sometimes brutally so, and I love it.  Am I genderqueer?  lol.  I dressed like a boy when I was a kid, and only hung out with boys, and did boy things.  99% of my friends are still all guys, and the girls I maintain friendships with are always a bit dominant and masculine themselves.  Hitting puberty I think fucked it up.  Like I was too young to register the fact that society was pushing me into a gender roll that I didn't necessarily feel inside of myself.  I love being feminine, in dress and makeup, but there is this repressed masculinity in me I feel.  Not sure how to deal with it.  
  
Also, I have a whole bunch of questions to one day ask about my boyfriend.  I won't even get into that now.
  
Anyways, this was a rant I guess.  I really wanted to get this off my chest to a group of people who wont think I'm completely mental.  Also, ask what label I could apply to myself if I wanted to.  I see now that the genderqueer term has a pretty vast definition.

Where I am in the 'dirty south', I am not very popular. People want me to cut my hair, etc. I know some can identify here as a lot of people have been through it.

I have in a guy's term 'kick ass facial hair' when it grows in, which is sort of ironic cause I don't want it and some around me can't grow full beards. Anyways, I was thinking about laser (or saving up for laser) 

My quandary however is whether to continue in my current path. I feel like with my super fun time attitude and looks (sometimes i can seem abrasive but I am always nice when I talk to people) :( I just don't seem to find many that are attracted to me in my current state. I know if I changed myself back to what I was, I would attract but in a cis straight male perspective not as myself cis bi somewhat fem looking male.

And as such, it's hard to even consider asking people to use neutral pronouns, because I know it'd lead to explanations and prejudice and the like on a near-daily basis, and I don't know if I could handle that at all.

Good Ol' Riker.  Always falling in love with everyone.  The episode does an alright job, I don't know if it is perfect, but it's interesting.  Has a few really neat bits in it.

My friend who is gay (and I almost dated) wasn't understanding where I was coming from. He is aware of trans* people in general, and is very supportive. But he was convinced that I was actually male, as opposed to having a male body and no gender identity.

I'm not sure if it is because he so thoroughly defies gender roles but still identifies as male, or if it is because gender identity in general is so flimsy that my rejecting it isn't a big deal, but he didn't seem to understand my perspective.

I don't understand what it means to ""be a man"". There are cultural things, which are irrelevant because anyone can defy those expectations or follow them regardless of gender. There are also things that have to do with biological sex, I have a male body, and I'm ok with it. But I don't identify as male.

So I'm not sure if he just doesn't get it, or if has similar ""identity"" (quotations because it isn't part of my identity) but still identifies male because he doesn't have anything else to identify as, or if every ""man"" feels the same and I am just one of the ones in a place to see it as an empty title. I don't think it is the last, because the confidence with which I have seen people reject their biological sex far outmatches any sense of gender identity I've ever had.
