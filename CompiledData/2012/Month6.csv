4,2012-06-08 13:53:57,urk50,3,15,"Everyone seems to have differing definitions of the whole gender thing, so the definitions I'll be using in my post are as follows:

Gender identity -- sense of whether one is bigender, agender, girl, man, genderfluid, etc

Subconscious sex -- set of expectations and sense of your sexed body

----

I was born transsexual female, I was assigned male at birth. My subconsious sex is female.

After coming to terms with my subconscious sex, I initially thought that it must mean I was a trans girl/woman/ifeeltoooldforgirl/tooyoungforwoman/.

This sort of made sense at the time -- back then I was viewing subconscious sex as analagous to gender identity.

The gender binary means that the easiest way for me to be recognised as female would be to say I was a girl/woman. Within a society which religiously and violently holds onto the gender binary, feminine pronouns are associated with the female sex.

Being recognised as female is very important to me, I cannot relate in any way to a male body.

I like being addressed with feminine pronouns but I think I may just be misinterpreting my pleasure towards being recognised as female as pleasure towards being recognised as a girl/woman. Society and it's gender binary complicate things.

But I'm not so sure about this whole gender and gender identity thing.

Now I have the terminology and a context with which to place my subconscious sex in, a context separate and distinct from gender identity, I'm suddenly hit with utter confusion as to what gender is. Is this thought process even right, are subconscious sex and gender identity distinct?

Is gender just a set of culturally constructed stereotypes and assumptions based upon one's sex? Fuck that. That's not a concept I can associate with.

Is gender a method of communication, much like wearing a t-shirt displaying a logo of a Linux distro is? Is it analagous to a t-shirt broadcasting the message that -- ""Hey, I'm part of this group, 'Linux user'"". ""Hey, I'm part of this group, 'girl'"". I don't know, fuck. There isn't any sort of homogeneity within the gender groups, unlike the concept of 'Linux user'. 

Is gender an umbrella term, consisting of societal steroeotypes, subconscious sex and other things I'm not aware of?

To me, if I think of gender as not being defined to encompass cultural stereotypes and/or subconsious sex then I draw a complete blank as to what's left behind within the label of ""gender"" -- it becomes meaningless to me.

If gender is defined to comprise of stereotypes and/or subconscious sex, I'd be quite correct in my thinking that the concept of gender without those becomes nothing. People's usage of, and identification with, gendered terms seems to suggest otherwise. Why do so many people identify within the binary? Why do so many people refer to gender with their transsexual status -- trans woman, trans man, etc -- why, if gender means [stereotypes + subconsious sex], are so many people happy with attributing themselves to the stereotyped part? Why do they not just say ""I am a transsexual female""?

Is gender something more? Am I just agender or androgyene and my gender is sort of, kind of, defined by the lack of one, or at least some sort of extreme apathy -- is this almost blinding me to other's views on genders like man, woman, bigender, etc? I don't know, I've only properly versed myself with the experiences of binary identified transsexual people so my knowledge is most certainly lacking in these areas.

If gender identity doesn't include, and is separate from, subconscious sex, what is gender identity? What does that mean for gender? I just don't understand the concept of gender anymore. I wish I could just be seen as a female person, rather than messing with this girl/woman buisness but it seems I don't have much choice within this binary society (aside from of course, educating the few close to me).

Am I just a trans woman who's overthinking everything and tying herself in knots?

The only other person I've brought any of this up with at all is my half sister who I barely even know because she's lived in Washington my entire life, and a stranger I found from one of my friends on facebook who works for the Gender Identity center of facebook.

Basically I've been having tons and tons of mixed feelings about who I really am. When I was very young, like in second grade I've felt like I would be more me in a girl's body. I remember specifically praying to God one night as hard as I could, to put me in an alternate universe but as a girl even though my family weren't religiously involved in almost anyway. After that I started to second guess my self and tricked myself into thinking my life wasn't so bad as a male.

I've spent long long nights thinking about it specifically and now I just really don't know what I actually want. On one hand I find everything to do with being female interesting and feeling as if that's what I want, and I even just ask to go by my chosen female name and use a feminine voice when talking to other people online, though I have never shown them my face, and I make up a different past to explain my own side of things like some sort of compulsive liar, though I just really don't want to be a guy. I'm not trying to get ANYTHING from them besides them believing I am really a cisgendered woman.

And then on the other I hand I pulled myself out of depression from ""not being"" a female and was completely fine with being a male.

But I still can't help but thinking, like, I would be me if I wasn't ""QuestionablyGqThrow"".

It's all very confusing to me and I feel like there's two me's. One that's female and one that's male.

The only thing I am absolutely certain about my sexuality and gender identity though is that I'm pansexual

If anything I GUESS I would choose to identify as genderqueer or possibly bi-gender, but I still can't but help feeling I just want to be a woman in a woman's body.

 Many of my friends say I am gender-queer and some say gender-fluid. What is the difference? Secondly my sex is male, born that way. I tend to be very masculine most of the time but I have frequent times my life almost weekly where I feel like I am a woman and just am very feminine with my behavior, dress, feeling the need to shave more of my body than normal, etc. I don't cross-dress but that is due to money and not being able to afford a new wardrobe.

 For many years I thought I should have been a woman and considered getting surgery but I now know this is not the case and would have been a mistake. None of this bothers me but I see terms like gender-queer, gender-fluid, and many others and I am trying to understand which would apply to me?

 As for sexual orientation, I identify as pansexual and some pansexuals say I am ""gender-blind"" but I was under the impression that had to do with the gender/s I am attracted to which then that would be accurate.

 Now please don't say I don't need a label to be who I am. I inherently know this and believe it. However no matter how much I may think that way, labels (restricting though they may be) are useful and in this case, I am trying to find out how I relate.

As said, I was raised in the LGBT community. Needless to say, this has shaped every ounce of my being into a more open-minded person in all directions.

My friends have always joked about how they expected me to be gay. Except replace friends with fucking everyone and replace joke with constant verbal and physical harassment throughout the entity of my childhood. You see, I was a faggot by proxy. It was always ""Is he going to be gay or not gay?"" It was never about ""Who is he going to grow up to be?"" It made me sick, but that's a LONG rant for another day.

Being forced into that box had me CONSTANTLY doubting my sexuality. Gods forbid I prove any of those abusive bastards right and be attracted to a boy, OH NO NEVER. I have finally come to terms with my attraction to -some- men, but it's mostly the guys that sit in the middle (think VERY andro/center). If I actually appreciated my own dick, I'd probably hop on one, but I have a hard enough time not being bored to death or reviled by my own parts. Again, a story for another day, but HEY I'M TRYING TO BUILD A FRAMEWORK HERE, BE PATIENT, okay?

*cough* So, over the years, I've always thought about the ebbs and flows of sexuality. My dead-set attraction to lesbians and tom-boys, I came to find out, wasn't because I was ""jealous"" or ""wanted what I couldn't have"" or ""programmed"" by my parents. I've genuinely been attracted to lesbians, like, full throttle ""OMG I WANT TO GET TO KNOW HER AND SNUGGLE"" kind of attraction. For years I've fought with that until a kind, queer-minded individual told me ""No, seriously. It's okay. You're a lesbian with a penis.""

It blew my mind. Homosexuality is A sexual orientation in a myriad. I might be physically a male, but I am homo-emotionally female. I'm also physically nothing near masculine. I've always been slim and slender and never put on muscle (nor did I EVER want to,) and this did nothing but fuel the ""FAGGOT!"" fires I had to deal with as a kid.

Then, I learn about what it is to be genderqueer. The term seemed to fit so well. I sat on it for a loooooong time and finally decided to come out to my friends. Bi never felt right because I dislike men so much I hate myself sometimes for it. I'm definitely not gay, but I'm not straight, either. I've always felt somewhere in the middle. ""Queer but not gay is."" how I used to say it (especially every time a boy wanted in my pants). Genderqueer not only SOUNDS better, but it feels RIGHT. 

The few that understood more or less reacted: ""Duh."" The few that didn't asked me to enlighten them. Some of my friends (gay/bi/straight) decided that I was just looking for attention and ""The whole genderqueer thing is just a fad."" I was crushed, but the label was good enough for me, it encompassed everything I had been FEELING but unable to put a name to for YEARS.

My mom, however, looked at me like I was speaking a different language.

""So, you want to be a tranny?""

No, mom, I don't. See, mom identifies as bi. She was with a woman for the first 23ish years of my life. I've only known her as a lesbian. When I was a kid, we went to pride fest every year. Eventually, tho, their participation in the LGBT community stopped. So, apart from having almost zero support for being ""gay by proxy"" and all of the discrimination that brought, my mom is also VERY behind the times on the minutia of sexuality and gender identity. I tried to explain to her more or less everything I've described above, and more. The conversation ended with her saying ""Well, I just don't understand."", yawning and then she went to bed.

We haven't talked about it since.

See, I was expecting... something. Maybe that's why it hurt. I didn't expect anger... what kind of hypocritical monster would she be. But I got nothing. No support. No concern, just complete disinterest.

So, why is this a problem? Why am I bothering to pour my heart out to a small sub-sub-reddit?

Well, I am deeply considering hormone therapy to bring myself closer to the middle of the gender spectrum. The term ""tranny"", when I think of it being applied to myself makes my stomach turn. I'm not wanting to change from one gender to another, I'm trying to find ME. Since mom seems to see things so black and white, I feel like it's going to be a hard sell and I might not get the love and support I was expecting. It's one thing to tell your mom you're gender non-conformist, it's another thing entirely to have to explain starting HRT without the intent of going ""tranny"".

My biggest fear is having to come out AGAIN. To everyone. Especially my partner who is biologically female, also genderqueer, recently came out as homo-emotional and said she LOVED me because she sees me as ME. I am pretty sure she would stick through HRT with me, but everything else is... scary. I've always been afraid to identify as a lesbian because I was afraid that the ""real"" lesbian community wouldn't take me seriously. I've felt for a long time like I'm just crazy, or have no place in the world, but it seems I might not be as alone or batshit as I thought I was.

Honestly, I don't know what I was trying to accomplish with this post. Call it an introduction, a lament and an open-hearted rant. I think I might actually be soon loosened from the cold grips of insomnia.

25,2012-06-24 23:28:22,vjm53,27,42,"I posted this on FetLife, and it got a good reception, so I thought I'd post it here as my introductory post. It's written for a general audience, not necessarily for those who are familiar with queer or gender theory. And I like I say in the opening paragraph, this is just *my* genderqueer manifesto. It's not meant to speak for anyone but me. Hopefully everyone who would want such a thing can and will write theirs too.

---

The very first thing I want you to notice is that this is titled *My* Genderqueer Manifesto. It's not *The* Genderqueer Manifesto nor even *A* Genderqueer Manifesto. This one is mine and no one else's. Just like my gender(s). And like my gender, I reserve the right to modify it on a whim, to update it to reflect new knowledge, and for it to be completely nonsensical to those outside of my head. Modifications, updates, and other changes may (and likely will) be made without this document ever being updated.

I am genderqueer.

In that big [QUILTBAG](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=QUILTBAG) in which so many of us hang out, you can find me in the Q and the G. G for genderqueer. Q for queer. But not Q for questioning. I'm not questioning. **I am the question.** My life, my identity, my practices are a big fucking question mark, and I love it that way.

**So what's it mean when I say I'm genderqueer?**

* It means sure, I'm a guy. Except when I'm not.
* It means sometimes I'm a girl too.  
* It means sometimes I'm neither, or both, or something else entirely.  
* It means I'm rarely a man, and even less often a woman.  
* It means that when I fix a car or build something that I don't feel manly or like I'm living up to the gender that is assigned to me. It means I'm really more of a tomboy in those moments.  
* It means that I'm not crossdressing when you see me in skirts and makeup. I'm not wearing women's clothes. I'm wearing *my* clothes, thank you very much.  
* It means you can refer to me as ""he."" Or ""she."" Or ""ze."" Or any other personal pronoun you prefer. They'll all be right enough, and I don't mind any of them. Well, except maybe ""it.""  
* It means that my beard is pretty and girly, at least when I want it to be.  

**So what does it not mean when I say that I'm genderqueer?**

* It does not mean that I want to start taking hormones or have my body surgically modified. Some genderqueer people do. That's cool. It's not for me.  
* It does not mean that I'm under any obligation to make my identity apparent to others. Most days I'll be in slacks or jeans and a button down. You'll likely not actively notice anything about my gender.  
* It does not have any bearing on my sexual orientation. I'm mostly attracted to women, and also to other genderqueer folks. I'm sometimes attracted to guys. None of that has anything to do with my gender identity nor with my gender expression. I'm just omnomsexual. ^1    
* It does not mean that I feel I was born in the wrong body. I fit my body perfectly. I am my body. My gender and my body are inseparable, but that doesn't mean that I let others assignation of gender to my body limit me.  

I notice that my expression of gender varies along with where I am on the extraversion/introversion spectrum. The more extraverted I am, the more stereotypically feminine I am likely to appear. The more introverted I am, the more stereotypically guy my appearance will be.

Usually.

But no matter my expression, I am always genderqueer.

Even when you can't see my queerness, it is there. It is who I am. It is how I am. Forget that if you prefer. My queerness is not your responsibility, and it does not need your recognition. But forget it at the risk of failing to see and understand me.

&gt; Queer is a territory of tension, defined against the dominant narrative of white-hetero-monogamous-patriarchy, but also by an affinity with all who are marginalized, otherized and oppressed. Queer is the abnormal, the strange, the dangerous. Queer involves our sexuality and our gender, but so much more. It is our desire and fantasies and more still. Queer is the cohesion of everything in conflict with the heterosexual capitalist world. Queer is a total rejection of the regime of the Normal.

&gt; *[Toward The Queerest Insurrection](http://zinelibrary.info/toward-queerest-insurrection-0)* 

I refuse to let myself be managed and policed and limited by narrow, binary gender. I am both/and/neither/nor. I am ""Yes, ma'am,"" ""Yes, sir,"" and ""I don't know what to call you.""

I am a walking, talking, living, breathing question mark exploding every binary that tries to catch me.

I'm currently attempting to gather submissions for a magazine idea I have. If I can get enough submissions I am going to start a Kickstarter fund to at least put out one issue. But first I need submissions!

My magazine idea is called ""Intersections"" and it focuses on feminism/gender issues and how it intersects with all the other -isms out there because I feel that there are way too many publications out there that just focus on a white/cis/straight kind of feminism that perpetuate gender binary and are far too exclusive of anyone who falls outside that sector. That being said, I want submissions from *everyone,* but what I'm looking for is diverse viewpoints.

What am I looking for?

* Prose
* Poetry
* Photography and art
* Essays
* Columns
* Rants
* Reviews of movies, books, or anything pertaining to gender

On what subjects?

* Identity
* Fashion
* Love
* Politics
* Gender
* Sexuality
* Sex
* Humour
* Lifestyle
* Dysphoria
* Seriously fucking anything that you consider relavent

If you have anything at all that you would like to see in print, please message me for my email address. Obviously I can't pay you (my dream is to one day be able to pay contributors), but what you get out of it is a byline, a piece for a portfolio, and glory, of course.

6,2012-06-08 13:53:57,urk50,3,15,"Everyone seems to have differing definitions of the whole gender thing, so the definitions I'll be using in my post are as follows:

Gender identity -- sense of whether one is bigender, agender, girl, man, genderfluid, etc

Subconscious sex -- set of expectations and sense of your sexed body

----

I was born transsexual female, I was assigned male at birth. My subconsious sex is female.

After coming to terms with my subconscious sex, I initially thought that it must mean I was a trans girl/woman/ifeeltoooldforgirl/tooyoungforwoman/.

This sort of made sense at the time -- back then I was viewing subconscious sex as analagous to gender identity.

The gender binary means that the easiest way for me to be recognised as female would be to say I was a girl/woman. Within a society which religiously and violently holds onto the gender binary, feminine pronouns are associated with the female sex.

Being recognised as female is very important to me, I cannot relate in any way to a male body.

I like being addressed with feminine pronouns but I think I may just be misinterpreting my pleasure towards being recognised as female as pleasure towards being recognised as a girl/woman. Society and it's gender binary complicate things.

But I'm not so sure about this whole gender and gender identity thing.

Now I have the terminology and a context with which to place my subconscious sex in, a context separate and distinct from gender identity, I'm suddenly hit with utter confusion as to what gender is. Is this thought process even right, are subconscious sex and gender identity distinct?

Is gender just a set of culturally constructed stereotypes and assumptions based upon one's sex? Fuck that. That's not a concept I can associate with.

Is gender a method of communication, much like wearing a t-shirt displaying a logo of a Linux distro is? Is it analagous to a t-shirt broadcasting the message that -- ""Hey, I'm part of this group, 'Linux user'"". ""Hey, I'm part of this group, 'girl'"". I don't know, fuck. There isn't any sort of homogeneity within the gender groups, unlike the concept of 'Linux user'. 

Is gender an umbrella term, consisting of societal steroeotypes, subconscious sex and other things I'm not aware of?

To me, if I think of gender as not being defined to encompass cultural stereotypes and/or subconsious sex then I draw a complete blank as to what's left behind within the label of ""gender"" -- it becomes meaningless to me.

If gender is defined to comprise of stereotypes and/or subconscious sex, I'd be quite correct in my thinking that the concept of gender without those becomes nothing. People's usage of, and identification with, gendered terms seems to suggest otherwise. Why do so many people identify within the binary? Why do so many people refer to gender with their transsexual status -- trans woman, trans man, etc -- why, if gender means [stereotypes + subconsious sex], are so many people happy with attributing themselves to the stereotyped part? Why do they not just say ""I am a transsexual female""?

Is gender something more? Am I just agender or androgyene and my gender is sort of, kind of, defined by the lack of one, or at least some sort of extreme apathy -- is this almost blinding me to other's views on genders like man, woman, bigender, etc? I don't know, I've only properly versed myself with the experiences of binary identified transsexual people so my knowledge is most certainly lacking in these areas.

If gender identity doesn't include, and is separate from, subconscious sex, what is gender identity? What does that mean for gender? I just don't understand the concept of gender anymore. I wish I could just be seen as a female person, rather than messing with this girl/woman buisness but it seems I don't have much choice within this binary society (aside from of course, educating the few close to me).

Am I just a trans woman who's overthinking everything and tying herself in knots?

](http://redd.it/uu8f0)**

The only other person I've brought any of this up with at all is my half sister who I barely even know because she's lived in Washington my entire life, and a stranger I found from one of my friends on facebook who works for the Gender Identity center of facebook.

Basically I've been having tons and tons of mixed feelings about who I really am. When I was very young, like in second grade I've felt like I would be more me in a girl's body. I remember specifically praying to God one night as hard as I could, to put me in an alternate universe but as a girl even though my family weren't religiously involved in almost anyway. After that I started to second guess my self and tricked myself into thinking my life wasn't so bad as a male.

I've spent long long nights thinking about it specifically and now I just really don't know what I actually want. On one hand I find everything to do with being female interesting and feeling as if that's what I want, and I even just ask to go by my chosen female name and use a feminine voice when talking to other people online, though I have never shown them my face, and I make up a different past to explain my own side of things like some sort of compulsive liar, though I just really don't want to be a guy. I'm not trying to get ANYTHING from them besides them believing I am really a cisgendered woman.

And then on the other I hand I pulled myself out of depression from ""not being"" a female and was completely fine with being a male.

But I still can't help but thinking, like, I would be me if I wasn't ""QuestionablyGqThrow"".

It's all very confusing to me and I feel like there's two me's. One that's female and one that's male.

The only thing I am absolutely certain about my sexuality and gender identity though is that I'm pansexual

When I was very young, like in second grade I\'ve felt like I would be more me in a girl\'s body. I remember specifically praying to God one night as hard as I could, to put me in an alternate universe but as a girl even though my family weren\'t religiously involved in almost anyway. After that I started to second guess my self and tricked myself into thinking my life wasn\'t so bad as a male.\n\nI\'ve spent long long nights thinking about it specifically and now I just really don\'t know what I actually want. On one hand I find everything to do with being female interesting and feeling as if that\'s what I want, and I even just ask to go by my chosen female name and use a feminine voice when talking to other people online, though I have never shown them my face, and I make up a different past to explain my own side of things like some sort of compulsive liar, though I just really don\'t want to be a guy. I\'m not trying to get ANYTHING from them besides them believing I am really a cisgendered woman.\n\nAnd then on the other I hand I pulled myself out of depression from ""not being"" a female and was completely fine with being a male.\n\nBut I still can\'t help but thinking, like, I would be me if I wasn\'t ""QuestionablyGqThrow"".\n\nIt\'s all very confusing to me and I feel like there\'s two me\'s. One that\'s female and one that\'s male.\n\nThe only thing I am absolutely certain about my sexuality and gender identity though is that I\'m pansexual\n\nIf anything I GUESS I would choose to identify as genderqueer or possibly bi-gender, but I still can\'t but help feeling I just want to be a woman in a woman\'s body.\n\nThanks ahead of time for helping.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'A Petition for Help and possibly some answers.', 'created': 1339328865.0}",8.0

 Many of my friends say I am gender-queer and some say gender-fluid. What is the difference? Secondly my sex is male, born that way. I tend to be very masculine most of the time but I have frequent times my life almost weekly where I feel like I am a woman and just am very feminine with my behavior, dress, feeling the need to shave more of my body than normal, etc. I don't cross-dress but that is due to money and not being able to afford a new wardrobe.

 For many years I thought I should have been a woman and considered getting surgery but I now know this is not the case and would have been a mistake. None of this bothers me but I see terms like gender-queer, gender-fluid, and many others and I am trying to understand which would apply to me?

 As for sexual orientation, I identify as pansexual and some pansexuals say I am ""gender-blind"" but I was under the impression that had to do with the gender/s I am attracted to which then that would be accurate.

 Now please don't say I don't need a label to be who I am. I inherently know this and believe it. However no matter how much I may think that way, labels (restricting though they may be) are useful and in this case, I am trying to find out how I relate.

As said, I was raised in the LGBT community. Needless to say, this has shaped every ounce of my being into a more open-minded person in all directions.

My friends have always joked about how they expected me to be gay. Except replace friends with fucking everyone and replace joke with constant verbal and physical harassment throughout the entity of my childhood. You see, I was a faggot by proxy. It was always ""Is he going to be gay or not gay?"" It was never about ""Who is he going to grow up to be?"" It made me sick, but that's a LONG rant for another day.

Being forced into that box had me CONSTANTLY doubting my sexuality. Gods forbid I prove any of those abusive bastards right and be attracted to a boy, OH NO NEVER. I have finally come to terms with my attraction to -some- men, but it's mostly the guys that sit in the middle (think VERY andro/center). If I actually appreciated my own dick, I'd probably hop on one, but I have a hard enough time not being bored to death or reviled by my own parts. Again, a story for another day, but HEY I'M TRYING TO BUILD A FRAMEWORK HERE, BE PATIENT, okay?

*cough* So, over the years, I've always thought about the ebbs and flows of sexuality. My dead-set attraction to lesbians and tom-boys, I came to find out, wasn't because I was ""jealous"" or ""wanted what I couldn't have"" or ""programmed"" by my parents. I've genuinely been attracted to lesbians, like, full throttle ""OMG I WANT TO GET TO KNOW HER AND SNUGGLE"" kind of attraction. For years I've fought with that until a kind, queer-minded individual told me ""No, seriously. It's okay. You're a lesbian with a penis.""

It blew my mind. Homosexuality is A sexual orientation in a myriad. I might be physically a male, but I am homo-emotionally female. I'm also physically nothing near masculine. I've always been slim and slender and never put on muscle (nor did I EVER want to,) and this did nothing but fuel the ""FAGGOT!"" fires I had to deal with as a kid.

Then, I learn about what it is to be genderqueer. The term seemed to fit so well. I sat on it for a loooooong time and finally decided to come out to my friends. Bi never felt right because I dislike men so much I hate myself sometimes for it. I'm definitely not gay, but I'm not straight, either. I've always felt somewhere in the middle. ""Queer but not gay is."" how I used to say it (especially every time a boy wanted in my pants). Genderqueer not only SOUNDS better, but it feels RIGHT. 

The few that understood more or less reacted: ""Duh."" The few that didn't asked me to enlighten them. Some of my friends (gay/bi/straight) decided that I was just looking for attention and ""The whole genderqueer thing is just a fad."" I was crushed, but the label was good enough for me, it encompassed everything I had been FEELING but unable to put a name to for YEARS.

My mom, however, looked at me like I was speaking a different language.

""So, you want to be a tranny?""

No, mom, I don't. See, mom identifies as bi. She was with a woman for the first 23ish years of my life. I've only known her as a lesbian. When I was a kid, we went to pride fest every year. Eventually, tho, their participation in the LGBT community stopped. So, apart from having almost zero support for being ""gay by proxy"" and all of the discrimination that brought, my mom is also VERY behind the times on the minutia of sexuality and gender identity. I tried to explain to her more or less everything I've described above, and more. The conversation ended with her saying ""Well, I just don't understand."", yawning and then she went to bed.

We haven't talked about it since.

See, I was expecting... something. Maybe that's why it hurt. I didn't expect anger... what kind of hypocritical monster would she be. But I got nothing. No support. No concern, just complete disinterest.

So, why is this a problem? Why am I bothering to pour my heart out to a small sub-sub-reddit?

Well, I am deeply considering hormone therapy to bring myself closer to the middle of the gender spectrum. The term ""tranny"", when I think of it being applied to myself makes my stomach turn. I'm not wanting to change from one gender to another, I'm trying to find ME. Since mom seems to see things so black and white, I feel like it's going to be a hard sell and I might not get the love and support I was expecting. It's one thing to tell your mom you're gender non-conformist, it's another thing entirely to have to explain starting HRT without the intent of going ""tranny"".

My biggest fear is having to come out AGAIN. To everyone. Especially my partner who is biologically female, also genderqueer, recently came out as homo-emotional and said she LOVED me because she sees me as ME. I am pretty sure she would stick through HRT with me, but everything else is... scary. I've always been afraid to identify as a lesbian because I was afraid that the ""real"" lesbian community wouldn't take me seriously. I've felt for a long time like I'm just crazy, or have no place in the world, but it seems I might not be as alone or batshit as I thought I was.

Honestly, I don't know what I was trying to accomplish with this post. Call it an introduction, a lament and an open-hearted rant. I think I might actually be soon loosened from the cold grips of insomnia.

33,2012-06-24 23:28:22,vjm53,27,42,"I posted this on FetLife, and it got a good reception, so I thought I'd post it here as my introductory post. It's written for a general audience, not necessarily for those who are familiar with queer or gender theory. And I like I say in the opening paragraph, this is just *my* genderqueer manifesto. It's not meant to speak for anyone but me. Hopefully everyone who would want such a thing can and will write theirs too.

---

The very first thing I want you to notice is that this is titled *My* Genderqueer Manifesto. It's not *The* Genderqueer Manifesto nor even *A* Genderqueer Manifesto. This one is mine and no one else's. Just like my gender(s). And like my gender, I reserve the right to modify it on a whim, to update it to reflect new knowledge, and for it to be completely nonsensical to those outside of my head. Modifications, updates, and other changes may (and likely will) be made without this document ever being updated.

I am genderqueer.

In that big [QUILTBAG](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=QUILTBAG) in which so many of us hang out, you can find me in the Q and the G. G for genderqueer. Q for queer. But not Q for questioning. I'm not questioning. **I am the question.** My life, my identity, my practices are a big fucking question mark, and I love it that way.

**So what's it mean when I say I'm genderqueer?**

* It means sure, I'm a guy. Except when I'm not.
* It means sometimes I'm a girl too.  
* It means sometimes I'm neither, or both, or something else entirely.  
* It means I'm rarely a man, and even less often a woman.  
* It means that when I fix a car or build something that I don't feel manly or like I'm living up to the gender that is assigned to me. It means I'm really more of a tomboy in those moments.  
* It means that I'm not crossdressing when you see me in skirts and makeup. I'm not wearing women's clothes. I'm wearing *my* clothes, thank you very much.  
* It means you can refer to me as ""he."" Or ""she."" Or ""ze."" Or any other personal pronoun you prefer. They'll all be right enough, and I don't mind any of them. Well, except maybe ""it.""  
* It means that my beard is pretty and girly, at least when I want it to be.  

**So what does it not mean when I say that I'm genderqueer?**

* It does not mean that I want to start taking hormones or have my body surgically modified. Some genderqueer people do. That's cool. It's not for me.  
* It does not mean that I'm under any obligation to make my identity apparent to others. Most days I'll be in slacks or jeans and a button down. You'll likely not actively notice anything about my gender.  
* It does not have any bearing on my sexual orientation. I'm mostly attracted to women, and also to other genderqueer folks. I'm sometimes attracted to guys. None of that has anything to do with my gender identity nor with my gender expression. I'm just omnomsexual. ^1    
* It does not mean that I feel I was born in the wrong body. I fit my body perfectly. I am my body. My gender and my body are inseparable, but that doesn't mean that I let others assignation of gender to my body limit me.  

I notice that my expression of gender varies along with where I am on the extraversion/introversion spectrum. The more extraverted I am, the more stereotypically feminine I am likely to appear. The more introverted I am, the more stereotypically guy my appearance will be.

Usually.

But no matter my expression, I am always genderqueer.

Even when you can't see my queerness, it is there. It is who I am. It is how I am. Forget that if you prefer. My queerness is not your responsibility, and it does not need your recognition. But forget it at the risk of failing to see and understand me.

&gt; Queer is a territory of tension, defined against the dominant narrative of white-hetero-monogamous-patriarchy, but also by an affinity with all who are marginalized, otherized and oppressed. Queer is the abnormal, the strange, the dangerous. Queer involves our sexuality and our gender, but so much more. It is our desire and fantasies and more still. Queer is the cohesion of everything in conflict with the heterosexual capitalist world. Queer is a total rejection of the regime of the Normal.

&gt; *[Toward The Queerest Insurrection](http://zinelibrary.info/toward-queerest-insurrection-0)* 

I refuse to let myself be managed and policed and limited by narrow, binary gender. I am both/and/neither/nor. I am ""Yes, ma'am,"" ""Yes, sir,"" and ""I don't know what to call you.""

I am a walking, talking, living, breathing question mark exploding every binary that tries to catch me.

I'm currently attempting to gather submissions for a magazine idea I have. If I can get enough submissions I am going to start a Kickstarter fund to at least put out one issue. But first I need submissions!

My magazine idea is called ""Intersections"" and it focuses on feminism/gender issues and how it intersects with all the other -isms out there because I feel that there are way too many publications out there that just focus on a white/cis/straight kind of feminism that perpetuate gender binary and are far too exclusive of anyone who falls outside that sector. That being said, I want submissions from *everyone,* but what I'm looking for is diverse viewpoints.

What am I looking for?

* Prose
* Poetry
* Photography and art
* Essays
* Columns
* Rants
* Reviews of movies, books, or anything pertaining to gender

On what subjects?

* Identity
* Fashion
* Love
* Politics
* Gender
* Sexuality
* Sex
* Humour
* Lifestyle
* Dysphoria
* Seriously fucking anything that you consider relavent

If you have anything at all that you would like to see in print, please message me for my email address. Obviously I can't pay you (my dream is to one day be able to pay contributors), but what you get out of it is a byline, a piece for a portfolio, and glory, of course.

Moderator mail runs through a different message system; it allows all of our mods to see it, kind of like a second inbox. If you would like to speak to me privately, just say so and I will be happy to share my IM contact information with you.\n\nI will, of course, go through all of my messages individually, but I can't promise that I will be as prompt as usual. Just a heads up; keep on being awesome. =\\^.\\^="", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Just a general heads-up on contacting me for the near future', 'created': 1341110128.0}",32.0

I researched the topic a little, and decided that before investing in binding garments and such, I'd just experiment using a sports bra, an ace bandage and some duct tape. So I did, and put on my dapper-dyke mobster jacket, and looked at myself in the mirror.

Here is a link to the article online: http://cltampa.com/gyrobase/from-matt-to-maddie-turner/Content?oid=2969908&amp;storyPage=2#.T80XCdUeN8F

There are a lot of things fundamentally wrong with the article, though. I was really excited about it coming out after the interview, but I was also nervous because I wasn't sure how it would read. Well, when I first read it, it actually depressed me. Lots of misgendering, some misquotes, etc. After really thinking about it (and tons of friends telling me how amazing it is), I've come to terms that it's a great opportunity to spread awareness to those who don't have any transgender frame of reference at all.

I did decide to make a follow up video explaining some things a bit more in-depth. You can check that out here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwn75WDJLeE

Please let me know what you think of the article. Do you think it's helpful? Harmful? Did you like / dislike the follow up video? Lemmeknow!

140,2012-06-11 02:38:35,uvio6,17,38,"Yesterday was one year on HRT. 

I know in the past I've made fancy HRT photo montages, but it's already later in the evening and I'm winding down for the day and I'm already a day late in posting this.

A year ago, Thursday, June 9th, I had two doctor's appointments. First was with a therapist, second was with an endocrinologist. I was hoping that the first would go well enough that I could give the second whatever she needed to approve treatment. That didn't work out quite as planned.

The therapist strung me along for 3 more months before closing his practice without ever giving me the letter he promised. He discounted his fee for me due to my employment situation, but provided no actual service. 

Turns out, I didn't need him anyway. I explained my situation to the endocrinologist, and she was all too willing to help. She was excited, actually. In her words, she ""hadn't done one of these in a while, not since the 80's"". She was enthusiastic to try out the new options available for hormones.

At the same time, my friend who you all know here as TroubleEntendre, was going through a much less rosy battle. We had a good-natured ""race"" to see who would get their prescription first. Turns out, she won her victory the same day. We both got our first dose of estradiol within around 2 hours of each other. I don't really remember who won anymore, I was just too happy for both of us. (I can't tell her story for her, but unfortunately, due to interruptions and access problems, we can't truly celebrate ""One Year"" together in the same way.)

In August I went full time. I met our school's LGBTQ Resource Center director for coffee and decided never to go back to the male life. I was done. I wasn't passing in any meaningful sense, but that was that. I went to my high school reunion as a woman, with support on all sides (the organizer was a speech pathologist who did her master's work in MTF voice therapy, so she was fully supportive).

In September, I started a new job and university within a week of one another. No one at either place had known the old me, except as a name in my mother's stories for those coworkers who knew her. At school, I joined the GSA, I became a SAFE Space trainer, I gave talks to classes. I even got elected mid-semester as a replacement for the club's vice president. At work, my security badge only let me into the women's locker rooms on day one, and my coworkers were enthusiastic about me using it (to an almost awkward degree, haha), and I started an ultimately unsuccessful process to remove the transgender exclusion from the insurance policy.

But in a sign of things to come, I had to drop one of my classes, bringing me down to part-time status. The time commitment was too much. 

Second semester was even more ambitious. In February, I finally had to quit my job because I couldn't keep up at school. I gave a speech at the MBLGTACC conference, and met a ton of amazing people. But the entire second semester was a struggle between stress, sanity, and school. Finally, with just weeks left to go, I dropped a couple of my classes down to audit status to avoid D's. 

This led to a severe depression spiral: by dropping the classes, that would mean fall semester I would meet none of the prerequisites for the fall classes, and it would be spring before I could retake the ones I didn't get B's or above in. So, that would be a year waiting; pushing my transition timeline out by another year. That would mean this past year hadn't gotten me any closer (time-wise) to being able to pay to finish what I'd started with the endocrinologist. That would mean pushing starting a family out even closer to 40.

HRT has also brought back old trauma that I no longer have the coping mechanisms to deal with. My old methods fail entirely in the face of the stronger, more vibrant emotions that have come with estrogen. Make no mistake, that vibrant emotional life and strong connection to others has been the *best* part of this. By far. But it has also brought with it unshakeable bouts of hopelessness due to financial stress.

Either:

A) I put off school again and work at a job that will likely take even longer to pay for transition (if it ever will)

or 

B) I keep going and hope that at the end of this I actually get a job that will pay enough to make the wait worth it.

I detest living in a place that makes access to medical care so difficult. I do, in fact, have sincere doubts about whether or not I would make it to the end of either of those scenarios. I always have; I had since before I started. But I also knew I had to try or else I'd look back at last year's realization that transition was possible and regret not starting sooner. Hell, I ALREADY regret that part for the years I did miss because when I was 6 years old and telling my parents, there was no one who would have helped me then. Help never existed for me.

On the flip side, I will say that not all is bleak. These thoughts that gnaw at me—because I am celebrating a tranniversary that (today) only serves to remind me of how far I have yet to go, and of the one person I lost along the way that I still wish was here with me—are not the only part of the story.

The other part is that most days I am happier. There's still a few too many unwelcome reminders that things are still ""in progress"", a few too many reminders that with proper access I'd be done already. But on the whole, things are good. 

Transition has opened doors for me, given me the opportunity to meet some amazing people, re-meet old friends-of-friends who used to be in the background of my life but are now my closest friends, and has given me the opportunity to help others like us every single day.

I am resolved to seeing the positive. I know my situation is neither the worst nor the best but somewhere on the good side of the middle.

Most importantly, I have reddit to thank. A picture reached the front page last year of someone's transition montage, and it opened the floodgates for me. Other events had set me up to be vulnerable in that moment, and seeing it was the last blow to the wall I had put up around the feelings. The wall was so old I forgot it was there and what was on the other side. 

I want to thank you all for being so supportive, and for the advice and information I've learned here. I've drifted away lately, in part due to the school stress, and in part due to the weariness from the battle between subreddits. 

But I'll never forget what you all gave.

**TL;DR:** Thanks for inspiring me. It's been an awesome year.

**And now the pictures!**

i just want to turn all down there
inside out

a feminine mind dis-matches reflection
this is all it, i'm coming out

misunderstanding, judgment and hate
there are those who don't appreciate

lgbt unknown to some
lesbian gay bi trans
you don't just become

the womb creates
embryo mistakes
the brain begins structure
fetus becomes some other

hormonal imbalance
in the mind
the body produces
wrong amounts of each kind

a body mismatch
a struggle of mind
blueprint changes
the brain didn't find

this happens pre-birth
all your misguided directions
hateful. pretentious

the new testament came
you obviously don't follow
stuck with old versus Jesus did not follow

there is no justifying your hate that is hollow
i am Trans-gendered, your hate you can swallow


Self-Image shatters upon looking in the glass
This is a mistake
My mind screams THIS IS A MISTAKE

The mismatched hormones are produced
It's making my brain shutter
And it yells and cries
Being poisoned

This is painful
Mind still screaming GOD OH SO PAINFUL

Physical, Mental, Mind, Body
It's harmful to all to ignore
Ignore it no longer
I CAN IGNORE THIS NO LONGER

If you dare step my way and tell me i'm wrong
You better believe, 
Internal fury has made me strong

It's a clear message 
do what's right for yourself

No other can tell you
or they or morally wrong

I'm strong
I'm fierce
I'm doing what's right

Dare tell me you know what's right for me better
Dare it and get out of my sight

I have friends who know I am good
Many who are glad doing what I should

So if you must reside in hate
I am Trans-gendered
And many more of us all
Can all appreciate",transgender,"I wrote this, out of anger, love, self-acceptance, and peace within myself. I'm coming out.
