Thing is, I'm AMAB, but I don't feel 100% comfortable with being male. I'm definitely not female though. I like the ""he"" pronoun, I'm fine with being a ""boy"" or (less so) a ""guy,"" but ""man"" just doesn't work for me at all. And I guess I've started to get really obsessive about removing my body hair — maybe that's a body dysphoria thing, I don't know?

So when I found this thing where you identify barely as male, or maybe as a combination of male and agender, it seemed to stick.

I don't really know where to go from here, though. I'd like to do something to my presentation to confirm that my gender's different, but I'm not sure what to go on — I don't have a new pronoun to use, I'm not really into feminine clothing. 

And stemming from that, I've got the anxiety that my whole gender question is self-indulgent. I mean, I'm an AMAB demiboy. In a world where nonbinary people get told they're not trans enough, that's like the definition of not trans enough.

29,2016-06-16 18:43:31,4oexdd,0,10,"Hi folks,

We have a decent-sized community here, but it tends to be pretty quiet. Two of the truisms about internet conversations are that people are more likely to comment if they don't have to be the first, and that people are more likely to click a link when given some context. To that end, I'm implementing a small rule change that OPs of link posts should make a comment after posting that's intended to start discussion. This doesn't have to be an essay! Examples of comments include any or all of the following:

- a short summary of what the link contains (and how it differs from other active posts on the same topic, if applicable)
- your opinion of the content at the link
- any sort of question you'd be interested in talking about

r/menslib has endorsed this posting format with great success and has a lot of active posters and threads. Note that I'm not endorsing (or condemning) the content of r/menslib in any way. Plus the nature of their sub's topics draws trolls and their rule is also partially intended to deter pointless #butwhataboutthemen comments, which is not really something we deal with here.

I am a amab and consider myself non binary.
I have been thinking alot about the world and the idea that alot of the interactions between people are mostly a part of a  social construct made by human-kind through history.

Lets get to the point.
I am going to visit The VU Medical Centre in Amsterdam to start my journey into getting the body i want, but am a little afraid of the gender specialist team they have.

I dont know how open minded they are within the gender topic and i am scared that i wont be understood. They have a hard focus on the dysphoria part of being trans and i for a fact don't really have any form of dysphoria about my current body or social life.
They say people get mad if u put them in a psychiatric facility and thats a bit how my mind i thinking of the whole journey i am about the embark on.

I know what i want and don't like to go into this as a person thats searching for medical attention or something.
I have never had despressions, have a great social life, going to university to study sociology next year and have a great family.

I don't like the the feeling that some sort of dysphoria has to be diagnosed in their eyes and them trying to link everything i write or say to some sort of discomfort with my present life.
Their site even connected dysphoria and being trans with each other https://www.vumc.nl/afdelingen/zorgcentrum-voor-gender/

I am perfectly sane going into this and have confidence in the outcome and don't really care about people i dont know judging me when i start. My friends and mom will back me up for sure.
I just want to change my body not my open mind, you get it ? 

Anyone here have any experience as a non binary talking to the VU MC in Amsterdam ? 

Thanks,

Lesley

I can help you to feminize your voice.
I have already posted in this sub previously, but I figured there might be more people willing to have lessons that don't know about me.

- I am using my own methodology which is based on approach that is personal. 
  It means that I do not stick to one method with everybody, but rather try to figure out what works for you personally.

- I am sure that anybody can feminize their voice.
  Depending on skill and diligence the process can take from a couple of months to a year.

- And it is affordable.
  Any other voice feminization tutor will charge you at least twice as much. And will keep you paying for as long as he can.

I ask for 15$ per lesson. One lesson lasts for 45 minutes. The best schedule is three lessons per week, but we can arrange any routine that suits you best.

First lesson is free and you pay only after the lessons.

I am available from 8am till 8pm UTC+0.

7,2016-06-05 01:54:47,4mlegq,9,11,"Sorry for the giant wall of text.

So I'm an 18 year old male, and I've been thinking for a few months now that I may be trans. I say ""may"" because I'm still very unsure and conflicted over whether or not I truly am. 

I've always been a very solitary guy and I've struggled with social anxiety for a long time, but only recently have I started to think that this might be caused by gender dysphoria. For a very long time I've been uncomfortable and somewhat embarassed with the way my body looks, even though I know from an objective standpoint I'm not unattractive. I know a lot of people, even attractive people, are unsatisfied with their bodies look, but really I don't even think making myself look more attractive by masculine standards would make me feel any better. When I picture myself more muscular or whatever it doesn't really make me feel any better or encourage me, but when I picture myself as a woman I find it somewhat comforting.

The big reason that I doubt that I'm transgenered is that I don't think I've ever been able to point to any experience and definitively say ""that was gender dysphoria."" I can't remember having any particular childhood memories where I felt compelled towards more feminine things (which seems to be a very common occurence for trans people from what I've read), and there's never really been a particular moment in my life where I've said to myself ""I wish I was a woman."" I've read [That Was Dysphoria?](http://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) and I can relate to a lot of the symptoms described there, but of course those symptoms don't necessarily imply gender dysphoria and could easily be explained by plenty of other mental issues.

I recently ""came out"" to my girlfriend and told her about all of these thoughts. She was fantastically awesome about it and without any hesitation let me know that she was completely okay with it and would support me no matter what decision I eventually came to. It was extremely comforting to get this off of my chest, but more than just being comforting it just feels a lot less stressful to be around her in general since I told her. I've always gotten stressed out when being around people for too long, and while I know that's a very normal thing and I don't want to make myself out to sound like a special-snowflake type, since telling her I haven't really felt like I have to worry about acting masculine and it's been so much easier to talk to her honestly and without being stressed.

Again, I know getting stressed out around people is a normal thing, but at the risk of sounding self-important, I feel like the stress I get from being around people is more than just introversion. For my entire life I've felt like I was lying to everyone I interacted with, even my best friends and family, although I've never been able pinpoint exactly *what* I was lying about. I've often felt like I don't even really have a personality, I just mirror whatever the people around me are doing. I know that almost everyone acts differently around different people, but for me I've never even felt like I'm acting differently from my ""true self"" or whatever, but that I don't even have a true self to begin with. Only since I opened up to my girlfriend have I really felt that I'm not lying to anyone or pretending to be something that I'm not. I don't know if this is a result of telling her that I might be trans, or just generally being more honest to her about my emotions.

My girlfriend has been so supportive that she has even helped me try crossdressing a few times to see how it feels. She showed me how to put on makeup, let me try on some of her clothes, and even borrowed a wig from a friend to let me try it on. With all of it on I really did feel comfortable and calm, and for the first time I can remember I felt truly content with the way I looked (despite the fact that I looked far from perfect).

Now to get to the weird psychoanalytical side of the problem; I've been struggling with whether or not I'm trans for months now and I keep jumping back between thinking ""I'm definitely not trans and it's silly to even think that I am, I just have social anxiety or something,"" and ""I'm definitely trans and I need to stop denying it."" Based on this I think there are basically two possibilities to explain the way I'm feeling:

* I'm cis and I'm just using the idea of being transgender as an excuse to have hope because I want to believe that there is a solution to the anxiety and stress that I feel constantly
* I'm trans and I'm only denying it because I'm afraid of transitioning and don't want to ruin my relationships with everyone in my family and friends

I'm not really sure how to figure out which one of these is true. I've done a bunch of research and the question of ""Am I trans?"" seems to be met by something like [this](http://amitransgender.com/) most of the time, but I can't just accept it that easily. I'm also fully expecting that the response to this thread will probably be ""Go see a therapist,"" but unfortunately due to the fact that I'm living under my parent's medical insurance that would require letting my parents know about all of this, which I'm not ready to do just yet. I understand that seeing a therapist is unavoidably the eventual outcome of this situation but I figured it might be worth posting this here, even if just to collect my own thoughts.

I say ""may"" because I\'m still very unsure and conflicted over whether or not I truly am. \n\nI\'ve always been a very solitary guy and I\'ve struggled with social anxiety for a long time, but only recently have I started to think that this might be caused by gender dysphoria. For a very long time I\'ve been uncomfortable and somewhat embarassed with the way my body looks, even though I know from an objective standpoint I\'m not unattractive. I know a lot of people, even attractive people, are unsatisfied with their bodies look, but really I don\'t even think making myself look more attractive by masculine standards would make me feel any better. When I picture myself more muscular or whatever it doesn\'t really make me feel any better or encourage me, but when I picture myself as a woman I find it somewhat comforting.\n\nThe big reason that I doubt that I\'m transgenered is that I don\'t think I\'ve ever been able to point to any experience and definitively say ""that was gender dysphoria."" I can\'t remember having any particular childhood memories where I felt compelled towards more feminine things (which seems to be a very common occurence for trans people from what I\'ve read), and there\'s never really been a particular moment in my life where I\'ve said to myself ""I wish I was a woman."" I\'ve read [That Was Dysphoria?](http://the-orbit.net/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) and I can relate to a lot of the symptoms described there, but of course those symptoms don\'t necessarily imply gender dysphoria and could easily be explained by plenty of other mental issues.\n\nI recently ""came out"" to my girlfriend and told her about all of these thoughts. She was fantastically awesome about it and without any hesitation let me know that she was completely okay with it and would support me no matter what decision I eventually came to. It was extremely comforting to get this off of my chest, but more than just being comforting it just feels a lot less stressful to be around her in general since I told her. I\'ve always gotten stressed out when being around people for too long, and while I know that\'s a very normal thing and I don\'t want to make myself out to sound like a special-snowflake type, since telling her I haven\'t really felt like I have to worry about acting masculine and it\'s been so much easier to talk to her honestly and without being stressed.\n\nAgain, I know getting stressed out around people is a normal thing, but at the risk of sounding self-important, I feel like the stress I get from being around people is more than just introversion. For my entire life I\'ve felt like I was lying to everyone I interacted with, even my best friends and family, although I\'ve never been able pinpoint exactly *what* I was lying about. I\'ve often felt like I don\'t even really have a personality, I just mirror whatever the people around me are doing. I know that almost everyone acts differently around different people, but for me I\'ve never even felt like I\'m acting differently from my ""true self"" or whatever, but that I don\'t even have a true self to begin with. Only since I opened up to my girlfriend have I really felt that I\'m not lying to anyone or pretending to be something that I\'m not. I don\'t know if this is a result of telling her that I might be trans, or just generally being more honest to her about my emotions.\n\nMy girlfriend has been so supportive that she has even helped me try crossdressing a few times to see how it feels.

14,2016-06-08 18:18:02,4n6hhl,2,3,"Cis guy here with a question I've been thinking about a lot lately.

I work in the medical field and many of my patients are trans. It can be tricky because for insurance purposes, we need to use a patient's legal name and gender in their medical chart - otherwise, we run into all kinds of issues with billing, transfer of records and so on. My practice does a great job noting a patient's preferred name and pronouns on the chart, so despite the ""legal"" name and gender often being inaccurate to the patient's preference, we still have no trouble making sure we address the patient by their correct name and pronouns internally.

Where things can get tricky is if I'm sending documentation to another office. I think the easiest way to demonstrate what I'm talking about is with a hypothetical case.

Let's say my patient Rose Smith is a transwoman whose legal name is John Smith (she hasn't gone through the process of changing her legal name and gender yet). She has a thyroid issue so we are referring her to an endocrinologist at a local hospital. She is aware we are referring her and she is fine with the endocrinologist knowing she is trans.

The endocrinologist will have to register Rose under her legal name and gender for the reasons I mentioned before (billing, etc), and since Rose has already scheduled her appointment this has already been done. In the endocrinologist's medical records, she is listed as ""John Smith.""

I now need to fax medical records over to the endocrinologist so he is up to date on her case. The printouts from the computer all list her name as ""John Smith,"" again for billing purposes we unfortunately have to use the legal name.

I want to indicate on the fax that these records are for a patient who in their system will be named ""John Smith,"" but is actually Rose Smith. What is the best way to write the patient's name on the records to indicate this?

One of my coworkers typically writes something like ""John 'Rose' Smith,"" but I feel like putting the patient's preferred name in quotation marks implies that it isn't her ""real"" name.

I personally have been writing it as ""Rose (John) Smith,"" which I think gives the patient's preferred name its proper place while also indicating the legal name to avoid any confusion or errors.

I'm aware there are probably a lot of different opinions on this but I would love to hear from some trans folks on how they'd like this to be handled. These are documents that the patient is likely never going to see, but they can have a big effect on how the patient is addressed when care is being transferred from one office to another.

I am a straight 16 year old gal with plenty of issues, *PLENTY*. However, two of these issues, in particular, have been weighing on me for quite some time now.Yes, I am talking about my jugs.

Ever since these blasted fat sacks sprouted from my formerly flat chest way back in the seventh grade, I have been experiencing extreme self consciousness. Which, trust me, did not help with the already existing awkwardness of puberty. Part of this discomfort is from a physical standpoint, (Sports are hard when you're carrying jiggly-ass grapefruits on your body), but most of it comes from deep down inside. I absolutely hate having boobs, I hate the feeling of being sexualized by my breasts, and I hate not being able to dress in a way that empowers me.

Now, I haven't really wanted to do anything about these odd feelings until recently when my well-meaning mother brought home a pair of target pushup bras and forced me to wear them. These damned things felt so uncomfortable and disgusting, especially in comparison to my normal sports bra. My mom proceeded to set me down and tell my that I had to start wearing ""real bras"" and that I had uni-boob. She told me to be proud of having boobs. This brutal honesty shocked me and brought much more of my attention to my body.

To cover up, I began wearing tight fitting camisoles, over my bra, to hold my breasts in place. Then, I would pick out the baggiest tee that I could find and slouch the rest of the day.

To this day, I hate my clothes, my body, and my outward appearance. I am sick and tired of feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin, and I am desperately wishing for a day when I can rock my favorite androgynous outfits without my damn boobs getting in the way. I long to move and dress in a way that makes me happy. I want to be free.

This brutal honesty shocked me and brought much more of my attention to my body.\n\nTo cover up, I began wearing tight fitting camisoles, over my bra, to hold my breasts in place. Then, I would pick out the baggiest tee that I could find and slouch the rest of the day.\n\nTo this day, I hate my clothes, my body, and my outward appearance. I am sick and tired of feeling so uncomfortable in my own skin, and I am desperately wishing for a day when I can rock my favorite androgynous outfits without my damn boobs getting in the way. I long to move and dress in a way that makes me happy. I want to be free.\n\nIf any of you amazing reddit users has advice for me,  I would very much appreciate it.\n\nXOXO,\nMaddy', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Much Ado About Boobs', 'created': 1465619679.0}"

I've just been to the GP in my city and spoke to them about referring me to a Gender Identity Clinic. He was helpful and understanding and it feels like my first step to being happy. 

I feel so scared though. I've spoken a lot in the past couple of days with my girlfriend of a year and 9 months and whilst she is incredibly supportive and understanding she isn't sure she'd find me attractive if I changed, which I completely understand. It kills me that I might lose her because of what I feel I need to do to be happy, like if these feelings in my mind didn't exist then we'd just be happy and I could be the best boyfriend she'd ever have. 

We've also spoken about society, and how I'll no longer be considered 'normal' in the world anymore, and furthermore that if she stays with me that she'd also not be considered 'normal' because of it. It's just terrifying and it makes me hate that I'm doing this because of some stupid thoughts in my head. I just want to be happy with how I want to act, dress, speak, live. 

I feel like my family will be understanding, but it will still be difficult. 

If it was down to me I'd change in a heartbeat. But it feels like there is so much relying on me being who I am that it gets me so close to just saying fuck it I'll be miserable for the rest of my life. 

Sorry, there's so much going on in my head that I just can't even put it in to words. I just have to get it all out. I don't even think this is everything.

47,2016-06-23 04:35:37,4peyyj,1,9,"My father is pretty right-wing. Like, former Republican party district chair right-wing. I've told my mother I'm trans, but not him yet, because of course he's also an HB2 supporter. He understands gender so rigidly that last time I had dinner with my parents, I counted four times in an hour he declared something arbitrarily (such as ordering steak vs. seafood, or margarita vs. beer) as ""wot men do or do not.""

So yeah, haven't told him yet.

After Pulse, I realized I had to tell him I was trans regardless of the personal consequences. My mother was stressing this need relentlessly just so she wouldn't have to be my secret-keeper, yet when I decided to tell him, she flipped out because she was out of town and wanted to be there for him (would it really be that traumatic for *him*?) I'd already sent him a text saying that I needed to tell him something, but I recanted at her insistence. I told him I'd talk about it when she gets back.

Instead, I messaged one of my sisters. I could've handled this better, but I asked her what everyone in the family (except my father, of course) already knew: ""Are you a lesbian?"" She said yes, and I came out to her. I probably shouldn't have asked this, but I asked if she could stand with me on this one. She declined, and I don't blame her.

/r/the_donald is one of the largest transgender hate forums on the internet. /r/the_donald should be really named /r/transgender_people_hate because so much of their content is just [transgender hate and it doesn't have anything to do with Trump. ](http://archive.is/KKYcG)

 They've gotten away with this everyday for months while being the most visible subreddit on the site. It's pretty disgusting how this site harbors one of the largest transgender hate forums on the internet. This harassment and especially these threats of violence should be breaking site rules.

Here's a message one user sent to the admins in response to the FIRST week.

&gt;""How can reddit without a hint of self awareness, pretend to care about LGBT rights or pride month when you allow /r/the_donald to post BLATANT threats against transgender people, engage in harassment of transgender and shame them at every turn. How can you do this to the trans people on reddit? 

&gt;How can you find it okay to let this abuse towards one of the most marginalised groups in the world go on and on and on unchecked on your website, while at the same time claiming you give a shit about Pride month?

I like the newness of it. The sexual exploration that often comes with the dream is enjoyable but the big thing is something that lingers. The idea of just being a woman and having everyone have to accept that without knowing how is liberating. The thought that I could stay that way is exhilarating. 

It's made me realize how enjoyable it would be to be a woman like that. To just one day be. To experience it all, to truly feel that side of me would be enlightening. 

Then I wake up. A part of me mourns that loss of experience but another part of me is relieved that I can continue being me. Experiencing masculinity how I can and throwing in touches of femininity where my existence allows. It's grown me so close to my wife, seeing her world through a lens many other men might not think to look through. 

It's a side of me I can't shake nor want to. I often hope for these dreams to come. To live a moment in that fantasy where reality doesn't have to interfere. I don't feel the need for further exploration but a part of me always wonders and pushes to determine if there's a way to live closer to both parts.

Not even both parts. Both isn't the right word. I'm not male and female nor am I just male with fantasies. There's a part of me I know that's not defined binary. I just haven't found the way to be that. Words and labels can't define that place I want to be in. It often feels like the experience of others comes close but doesn't quite match what I need. 

I so greatly appreciate the support of a community such as this and the strides society has made to make it easier.

3,2016-06-01 21:54:22,4m3sst,2,12,"One thing that bothers me a lot about gender and gender roles is overgeneralizations that people make, statements in which people make an untrue generalization, like: ""Women are so blah-blah-blah..."" or ""Men are so blah-blah-blah...""  I'm especially bothered by ones that include all-or-nothing or absolutistic language like *always*, *never*, ""all women/men..."" or the like.  Another thing I heard a lot growing up are statements about ""real men / real women...""

I think these statements are one of the ways in which gender norms are enforced.  I think the statements contribute to defining the cultural constructs of gender.  The statements can be a positively-worded statement that defines a traditional gender norm including both positive and negative statements like: ""Women are sensitive and sweet / moody and emotional."" or ""Men are strong and assertive / insensitive and pig-headed.""  I think these statements can often be at the heart of misogyny and sexism, as well as transmisogyny and the shaming of femininity.  I think they also manifest in man-bashing that I see among women (i.e. making sweeping dismissals of men, rather than raising specific concerns about specific behaviors), which I think can itself be a way of reinforcing transmisogyny and indirectly, misogyny (especially because when women rant negatively about men, it downplays or erases men or male-identified people who don't fit into whatever stereotypes were being thrown around).

I tend to feel a visceral dislike for these sorts of statements and I tend to identify strongly with people who object to them.  I think that because these statements are made both about women and about men, these statements have contributed to me identifying both with women and men, especially with people who resist these sorts of statements or characterizations.  So like, I identify with both women and men, in terms of both of these groups of people being groups that are sometimes negatively characterized (or forced into ""positive"" characterizations that don't fit them and that can be coercive when people don't fit them), and so I can empathize really easily and intensely with people who break these things, including people who still feel like cis women or cis men.  It's like, because I identify so strongly with these things, it makes me feel like my own identity is split between the true groups, and lies in a neutral ground, outside of the generalizations.

I think that these statements capture one of the key or deepest aspects of how I experience gender.  First, I don't feel like I fit the stereotypes.  I'm AMAB and it was pretty evident as a kid that I didn't fit the ones about boys well at all, nor did I want to grow up to fit the ones about men.  But I also found that my friends who were girls, as well as adult role models, both women and men, often broke a lot of these norms / generalizations too.

Since my late teens I have had feminine thoughts and homosexual/bisexual/sissy thoughts in times of anxiety and low self esteem. When I have indulged these thoughts,mi have felt good in the moment, but in the long run it has lowered my self esteem even more.

I got to a period where I had no confidence with talking to girls. In this time, I would watch porn and fantasize about being the girl.

In my early 20s I found sissy hypno. It intensified all these things.

I've never been with a man, but i go through spells where I think about it, especially when porn binging/hypno binging.

When I am off the porn, I don't think about it as much, but when I do, it beckons to me.

Lately, I have been considering buying some girly supplies and trying crossdressing, but a part of me  thinks that will hit my self esteem in the long run even know the instant gratification might feel really good.


I guess I'm confused. There are often two forces....maybe more.... But two major forces pulling me. One force seems masochistic and submissive. This force seems to originate from low self esteem.
The other force is altruistic and ambitious, it seems to come from the need for a legacy and to put my mark on the world.

I want to indulge the dirty force from time to time, but I don't want to play with fire. I'm in my mid 20s now. I think this force has bitten deeper in to me. Although, like I said, it dies down when I drop the porn.

44,2016-06-09 07:05:25,4n9p7n,1,13,"So this is another post in a series of introspective crises where I reach the boiling point and reach out in hopes for more words of wisdom to guide me. 

Im about 80% sure im some form of nonbinary. When I started transitioning I did the whole pendulum swing and went to the far opposite end of the spectrum, the trans incarnation of a cis female. I made a very conscious effort to not suppress anything  (as I have my entire life with my gender), yet somehow I still managed to.

After well over a year of ""I am a woman I am NOT a third gender"", I opened up to my girlfriend to tell her there were times, not infrequent, that I still felt like a man. We explored the ideas, what it means to be a man and what it is men ""feel"", and of course it's just confusion.

Still, it would be dishonest of me to say its not in there somewhere. Gender identity is something you feel, something you know. You usually know it, even if you cant explain it, you just do. There are times I feel male. No explanation, it just is.

I want to embrace that. Its a part of me, it is me. 

The problem is, it seems to only be a source of pain. Not only that, but it doesnt line up with my gender expression or physical attributes very well.

71,2016-06-13 23:25:40,4nyhes,2,18,"hey everyone,

i've been doing a lot of really hard thinking lately. i was nonbinary id'd for quite a while but ultimately decided that social/medical transition to male, or medical transition to some androgynous state, was not ultimately right for me. right now i would say i don't really have any sort of gender identity, i locate myself in ""social space"" as a woman and will affirm that to other people, but it's not something i am attached to in any identity sense. oddly enough i have gotten much less feminine and more comfortable in my body since i started conceiving of myself this way. i still have dysphoria, but it is manageable, and i don't consider it an impediment to having a liveable life any longer.

one thing that prevented me existing stable-ly in a nonbinary/genderqueer identity, including an ""agender"" identity, was that i was in a lot of pain from dysphoria and the identity didn't seem to do anything to resolve my pain. having an inner identity never explained where my dysphoria came from or  how to deal with it, i guess. when i was heavily questioning myself about accessing transitional care i read a lot of nb/gq stories, including of people who transitioned, and related to them really closely. i devoured a lot of material and spent years on tumblr talking to people who were in the same position as i was. but i really felt like i was rarely digging into my issues in a way that actually... helped me? 

i was suicidally depressed and stuck in an emotionally abusive home on top of everything and felt similarly about that. relating to other people only helped me so much. i questioned how i was living every day but could never find a way out of my situation; it was like i was convincing myself into staying stuck sometimes out of fear and the conviction that i had no future ahead of me.

i was very public on the internet about my gender questioning but when i asked questions of other people or wrote about what i was going through, all i got were affirmations of my identity (which wasn't ever even clear) and some platitudes about starting transition (which i wasn't even sure i wanted). i didn't need that stuff! if i needed validation, what i needed was people to hear that i was hurting and confused and that i was worth responding to with care. 

i feel terrible saying this, but i feel like when you question in the trans or nonbinary communities, people just think you need to accept some inner thing in yourself or something (your cis/trans identity or whatever) so they try to build that up in you. i know i didn't need to hear that i was trans for sure, or not trans for sure; it's not like anybody could tell me that anyway. i feel like when people ask those questions they are really asking something like this: is it possible to live given the way i feel, is it possible to have a future at all in this world? and nobody addressed transition or dysphoria management from this perspective for me, except maybe to answer awfully in the negative.

honestly, i felt like the super-affirmative nature of a lot of online communities drove me insane. i felt like nobody was listening to me! i felt like i wasn't even asking a question about my life half the time, because what does it mean to ask a question when you can get only one answer from people? heck, even questioning itself was supposedly a sign of my identity because people who aren't trans or candidates for transition ""don't question their gender""! 

i still relate to a lot of nonbinary and genderqueer people; i think i'm just basically a mirror version of everybody here. i didn't know living like this was possible though. i didn't know i could have a good life with gender issues. i didn't know i could hold myself in a liminal space and be ok. everyone said i had to plow through my fears and doubts and just bite the bullet and transition! but i am alright, i am holding on.

There's not really a suitable gender neutral title [that I can think of] for use during bdsm play 
For example:
                      
DOM[ME]: ""kneel down and kiss my legs""
             
Sub: ""Yes, XXXX, as you wish""
                     
[/example]
                       
Master and mistress are both gendered and also I don't like the way they sound. My partner is a cis female and I'll call her ms. Or princess, when she is topping which works well, but when roles are reversed we haven't been able to come up with anything.

That thing about Mx. Has been floating around recently but it works better in writing than speech.

Of course I am NOT okay with anyone who trivializes our experiences as trans or genderqueer people. But the comments following this post were to the tune of ""you're not really trans if ___"" or ""god I hate non-binary IDs just so they can feel like a special little snowflake."" Apparently according to this group of youth, you must adhere to the ""trapped in the wrong body"" narrative, knowing since you were a very young child that you were trans in order to be valid.  Sadly, a lot of these sentiments run rampant among adult trans people, too. 

Personally, it wasn't obvious to me I was non-binary for a long time. Didn't take hormones until I was 28. I thought I wasn't really trans because I like having my body (well, aside from breasts - had top surgery recently and am loving my body so much more now).  It took me a long time to realize I don't have to adhere to the common trans narrative in order to deserve to exist, be valid, and make necessary changes via hormones/surgery, IF AT ALL. That being said, I also don't think anyone should have to do anything at all to be seen as who they truly are. I support my trans-sisters and brothers who don't take hormones or undergo surgery. 

In a way, I sort of did choose to transition. When I admit that in other trans subs or in other groups in my real life, I'm met with a lot of hostility. Do my experiences then not count? I'm going through the same things as many other transmen - socially transitioning, physical transition, putting myself at risk for violence, being told I'll ""never be a man, you stupid little bitch"" and whatnot. I've been called a gender-trender to my face by trans people over the fact that I admit I actually enjoy my genitals. I know these people are called ""truscum,"" which I would never say to anyone's face. 

It worries me to see such young people (middle school aged) perpetuate what I see as just as oppressive as the shit cis people try to impose on us. There is no right way to be trans, and I feel further marginalized as a genderqueer, non-binary person. I feel morally wrong to exclude genderqueer, genderfluid, and other gender variant people.

Is it that people feel threatened by anyone who is questioning, then take steps to present their gender identity (whether in clothing, hormones, surgery, etc), then realized they are cis after all? I mean, is it not a good thing to allow for everyone and anyone of all genders to open up how they can express themselves?  I think it's good to do away with gender roles and expectations of gender presentations.

I'm not sure what's going on, but I just wish we would stop policing each other so much. The stigma of being gender nonconforming or trans is so great that I doubt anyone would want to trivialize it for their own entertainment. I believe you if you tell me you are trans, or genderqueer, even if you don't ""look the part.""

Then there is transexual. This is essentially ""brain of a man in the body of a woman"" or vice versa. 

Then there is genderqueer/gender fluid/gender movement in general I do not understand fully. I thought I did but now I don't think so. The more I research this topic the more questions I have.

So, disclaimer, while I'm an ally of every gender and sexuality, I'm not 100% up to date on what's okay to say and what's offensive, so if I say something wrong, please gently correct me. It is not my intention to offend anyone.

Also, this got really long. I'm really sorry. It turned into a small rant.

I've been poking around this sub and other LGBT-related subs these last few weeks, trying to figure myself out, and I'm just getting more and more confused. I guess what I'm looking for is for someone to tell me ""what"" I might be so I can do a little more research. I'm sort of shoving myself into a closet, but I'm not sure what kind of closet it is!

I'm a 26 year old, straight AFAB. My entire life, I've just considered myself a tomboy. I still identified as female, but it was always a matter of, ""God, I would be so much happier if I were just born male."" I've always known I was different, but I've never had a word to describe myself.

But I never really felt transgendered, or like I wanted to transition to being male. I guess it was always more...resentment? Jealousy? Envy? That I ended up being female instead of male.

(This part might be slightly offensive; I do not intend it that way) I just generally hate most of what it means to be female. I hate my breasts, I hate that people expect me to be weaker than men (until I got fat and lazy, I prided myself on my muscles). I hate all the menstrual cycles, the potential to become pregnant, and all the hormone crap. I hate the things society expects of me, like wanting to be a mother, or wearing pretty clothes. I haven't worn a dress since I was 7, and I've been wearing pretty much nothing but t shirts and jeans since then. But, to society, I'm frumpy and just don't know how to dress well (well, okay, that's true...but it's also because I'm simply not comfortable in 90% of women's clothes).

I like sports. I like physical challenges. I like getting dirty, going exploring, wrestling with my dogs. I like cars, drinking beer, and watching violent movies. I know none of these apply only to men, but in my experience, society doesn't really like women who like these things.

I'm not attracted to women in the slightest. It's hard to explain, but if there was some 1-10 scale of how attracted to women I am, I'd be at -10. In the simplest, maybe offensive terms, I feel like a gay man trapped in a woman's body.

But then that's where I'm getting confused.

I started considering myself genderqueer somewhat recently (I'm not ""out"" to anyone because I still don't know what I am), but I'm getting so lost in all the different terms.

Am I trans? Can you be trans with 0 intention to transition (though I'd be *thrilled* if I could have top surgery)? Am I some demi-category? Genderqueer? Non-binary?

And, side note, I tried to have this conversation with the LGBT community and was downvoted to hell. Why aren't gender minorities ""allowed"" in the LGBT community? Because it's not a sexual minority? Or did I just run into a batch of negative people?

137,2016-06-25 10:52:51,4ps1so,3,5,"Its seems that I have 2 or more identity's in me that affect my gender.


I have a hard time figuring out which is more important and it's also hard to morph or mix them into one.

So I been on hormones (estradiol and antiandrogens) för 3 years now.
I started seriously thinking about being trans when I was 23-24 (I'm 30 now).

I discovered non-binary identity's quite soon after I started thinking about what I was, I have id as non-binary for the most time after 26.

But I'm sometimes also a woman.


Do you know what transhumanism is? and postgender?
I was heavily interested in it at the time I thought about being transgender.
I have always wanted to be ""something else"".
Actually I have wanted and want to be and android, an synthetic being.
But we are not really there yet of course.
But I feel a connection between me being non-binary and me wanting to be an android, synthetic being.
Cybernetics are expensive, hard to make and risky, hormones are cheap, you don't have to make them, just buy them and honestly I'm not going to be an synthetic being anytime soon, but I don't want to be a man, I don't want to be a ""natural"" being.

But at the same time I have had this thoughts I also wanted just to be a girl, although I have for the most time not considered me being born a girl, mentally, I actually thought I WAS a boy, but I could be a girl if I wanted.
There are various reasons I didn't and don't want to be a guy, it has a lot about sexuality.


Recently thou I been feeling more feminine, more like I could be a girl.
So much that I have started to say goodbye to my non-binary self on most sites and present as a binary woman.


But I'm also aware that it may be only temporary, that I will once again feel more comfortably being non-binary (genderfluid between aporagender and demi girl).

The thing is I don't wish to be genderfluid, its more that I seem I am, i would rather just be one of the two, either aporagender or a binary woman.
I don't like to mix things.


The things is I'm so proud about being non-binary (or rather being a ""unnatural"" modified being), I don't want to give that up.
But on the other hand, being binary has its advantages, mainly that its harder och maybe even impossible to get what I want from the health care, I want SRS but I'm afraid they won't allow me SRS if I tell them I'm non-binary, or even hormones if I tell them I actually want to be a android, a robot, a synthetic being.
I have also noticed that more girls show interest in me now that I'm presenting as a trans woman on dating sites.

It's so strange, I feel that being a girl could work, that I'm actually transgender from birth, I'm a girl born with defects. But I didn't think like that some years ago, then I was more like ""fuck the system, I'm going to BECOME a girl"".


Is it really possibly that I have become a woman thanks to the hormones?
Am I really flexible from birth about gender.
Or Am I so strong in my conviction in transhumanism that I actually have reprogrammed myself.
Or have I been a girl al along, just not realized it?

I can't decide if I'm that transhumanist, non-binary being that love to give a finger to ""nature"" and society about gender, if I'm just a natural girl.
The thing is I have a hard time being both, mixing them, I don't like to mix things.


The thing is I get a lot, more than anything else, pride and identity from being a transhumanist and messing with my body and gender, it's truly me, it gives me so much meaning.

I'm probably crazy, but that's ok, I rather be crazy and follow my dreams than being healthy but normal.



I don't know, I'm just so surprised that it's a possibly that I actually was transgender from birth and not only a crazy transhumanist being that just love to fuck with natures and societies expectations.


I fantazise about going the ""I'm a woman""-route just so I can get surgery, but then when I have everything, I'm going to come out as non-binary again, or as a transhumanist being, proving to the world that you can modify yourself, you can become what you want NO MATTER WHAT you were born as.




Basically:
I sometimes just want to be a girl.
I sometimes are a girl.
I sometimes wished I been born a cis girl.
I sometimes feel shame from being born a boy.
I sometimes feel non-binary.
I sometimes know I just a guy that have delusions.
I sometimes just want to say fuck you to ""gender"" and society.
I sometimes wished I was an android.
I sometimes wished I were nether a woman or a man.
Most of the time I get extreme pride, empowerment and MEANING from just going my own way, becoming what I dream of.

I'm AFAB &amp; recently identify as genderqueer, but still very new to everything. Still navigating different terms but I'm most comfortable with agender.

I'm mostly very comfortable with how I'm presenting &amp; I feel that it reflects my identity in a productive way but because I've only recently started identifying as gq I wonder if there's anything that you've found productive (like physical implements, anything from accessories to clothes, scents, foods, whatever) in navigating this territory.

I’m also lucky, I’m lucky that unlike so many people like me I haven’t had to deal with gender dysphoria or feelings of dissociation for the overwhelming majority of my life. But starting two years ago my gender dysphoria was kick-started and continued eating away at me until I finally had to confront it this May. I had a pretty major breakdown and even considered a transition to the opposite gender, anything, as long as it would quell this inner turmoil, this friction, this stress, this constant urge to be more feminine than a cis-gendered male like myself was raised by society to be. After some therapy and time to think I realized that transition to the opposite gender would only cause further issues. I’ve always identified with so many masculine feelings and traits and I would miss all of these in my life. So here I am somewhere in the middle of two genders, more specifically the label I identify most with is Bi-gender:

“Bigender is a gender identity which can be literally translated as 'two genders' or 'double gender'. Bigender people experience exactly two gender identities, either simultaneously or varying between the two. These two gender identities could be male and female, but could also include non-binary identities.”

Yes, I’m jealous, jealous because I don’t feel comfortable in my own skin. I’m jealous because I didn’t (and don’t always) present in a way that explains who I am to anyone, more importantly in a way that validates myself. To cope with these new feelings, I’ve found a lot of things that I can do to quell my dysphoria: painting my nails with top-coat (clear) nail polish, growing out my hair past the No.3 Wahl guard I’ve been using for 8 years, wearing more pink and light blue, keeping body hair in-check (ideally minimal but I go back and forth), these are all perfect and simple examples. But as many people who have gone to Vegas can tell you, sometimes you’ve got to go all out…

Well this was my first Pride and I went out (came out?) in style. Sometimes you just want to wear a sundress, ya know? Okay maybe you don’t know, and that’s fine, but sometimes I just have to wear a sundress or a cool retro fit and flair, and what better excuse than the widely accepting and loving environment of Pride week? But here I find myself, two days and two dresses into Pride being unable to share what has been one of the most powerful experiences in recent memory with the wide audience of people with which I occupy most of my time.

161,2016-06-28 00:24:20,4q6lsd,2,3,"Hey guys,

I'm not really sure where to begin on this so I guess I will give a little backstory on me. I'm AMAB, but when I was in preschool or so I hung out with pretty much exclusively girls. I remember playing with girly toys with them, such as My Little Ponies (I was a bring before it was cool) and my mom even has a photo of me in a princess dress from that time. This continued, at least to an extent into the beginning parts of elementary school, though I remember at the time my main motivation for hanging out with those girls was that I thought they were attractive (I was quite the player back then ;)). However I did have some male friends at that time, and as I got older my friend group shifted to more male. During middle school my school friends were male, though I had some female friends I liked to text with that I met outside of school. When I went into high school however, I remember one of the main things I was looking for was female friends -- partly because I felt like I fit in with them better, and also because that's something I really didn't have any of in middle school and so I wanted to do it just because I could. I did find myself in a primarily female friend group, however drama went down and I got the boot, so I found myself in another sausage fest. However the group is VERY LBGTQ heavy (out of the five other core members, only one is straight, and the statistics are similar, though less extreme for some associated groups), and while overall I only have two female friends (both from other associated groups), I have five AFAB friends, so there's a good amount of trans representation too. A few months ago, I begun to fall for one of my friends, who is AFAB but is genderfluid (though they have been slowly transitioning to a guy's name/he him pronouns). Around the same time, I broke down crying after my friends confronted me about being overly aggressive to them, and I admitted that I felt the need to do it to be seen as strong and manly. That was a pretty big turning point as I realized that it didn't matter if I was seen that way since it's just a dumb gender role, and I can be as girly as I want. At the same time I realized how distant I was in that aspect from some of my other male friends, and how much more emotionally vulnerable I was. I ended up mentioning some of this to the aforementioned person, and they were helpful, saying I may be bigender or something but I could also just be sick of male gender roles. I later caught myself mentioning to them that I wish I was a girl, but with a dick and stuff. Ever since then I've found myself browsing some of the relevant subreddits, like MTF, androgyny, genderfluid etc. however (and this is really embarrassing and one of the main reasons I used a throwaway for this) ive found myself getting off to it, specifically some of the pictures of the more attractive people. At the same time I find myself wishing to be them, ya know? Now the reason I mention one of my transgender friends that I have a crush on is because I feel like I could possibly be having these feelings because of them, but at the same time, I feel like they've always been in me to some extent (I clearly remembering mentioning to my mom in middle school that I wished I was a girl -- it was in response to some male drama that was happening at the time, but still). To figure this out, I remember sneaking upstairs and trying on one of my mom's dresses, however I felt somewhat out of place in it. However I recently dressed myself up in cat ears and some girly-ish classes and felt cute, not to mention at home. At the same time, I also realized I looked like my friend in them, and I never really felt the desire to look cute until I started falling for them (since they're very cute and not just in the attractive way), and I was getting off to it as well so I'm not really sure. Basically, is it just a phase I'm going through because I subconsciously want to be more like my friends? Is it a bizzare fetish? Am I actually genderqueer (or something)? I feel really confused, I keep wanting to androgonise myself more and be less of ""one of the boys,"" but I guess I'm just not sure why.

A couple final notes:

I remember another genderfluid person mentioning that they realized that's what they were when they couldn't figure out what gender identity they were, which really stuck with me.

In addition, I've noticed I act way more girly around girls and way more manly around men, though I suppose everyone does this to an extent.

At the same time, I've noticed this feeling has been sticking around more and more, but that's likely because I've been focusing on it more.

170,2016-06-29 05:44:51,4qdzvu,13,18,"I'm setting up an appointment with a gender/trans therapist soon, so hopefully I can work through this further, but this is basically where I'm at:

I'm AFAB and have struggled with gender dysphoria since I was tiny. In recent times I have confronted these issues head on and I've come a long way because of it. I've found profound relief in adopting a more androgynous way of carrying myself and dressing. On my severely dysphoric days, it seems to help with that ""whiplash"" feeling I used to get, where I'd wake up and suddenly just feel profoundly wrong. Now I feel more comfortable when that happens, and it tends to be much more subtle. 

However, I still have a lot of feelings regarding a low level of transition. Even on the days now where I feel the most comfortable in this female body, having worked hard to overcome feelings of self hate and low self esteem, I still feel wrong. I wish my voice was deeper. I can appreciate the form of my body, but I still don't want it. I look at my face, objectively nice looking, but feel at a loss with the undeniable femininity of it. And at the end of the day, even with all of my acceptance and even embracing of a birth body at odds with what is inside me, it bothers me to be gendered female, consistently. 

I read through pages of Testosterone treatment effects, stories of nonbinary folks on hormones, and trans timelines, and everything in my heart just sings with these stories. Except for one thing.

**HAIR.**

Maybe it's just a weird thing that I'm projecting/focusing on, but every single thing sounds great except for *hair growth*. I don't have a problem with hair on anyone else but myself. I've spent many years giving it a shot going all natural and I hated it. I shave my arms, my legs, my pits, and I do dainty landscaping on my fun zone. This is a constant- whether I'm feeling as femme as a disney princess or when I'm ready to just grow a cock already- I've always felt the most comfortable being femme, even when I'd prefer my body wasn't *female.* It's entirely possible that it would be a total moot point- that if I started T and began to look less female, it would be easier to accept body hair, but I'm not sure yet! The one that really holds me back is facial hair, though. I really don't want it. Like ever. I don't want to shave my face, or deal with stubble. Also when I have that thought, I feel like a bad trans person for hating the idea so vehemently :(

So I'm curious- what is hair growth like on T? Or, what is it like removing larger areas of hair? Is it a giant pain in the ass? Is there a way to nuke baby 'stache hairs from orbit as they first grow in to ensure they never return?",genderqueer,Hi! I have questions about body hair and HRT (testosterone).

And at the end of the day, even with all of my acceptance and even embracing of a birth body at odds with what is inside me, it bothers me to be gendered female, consistently. \n\nI read through pages of Testosterone treatment effects, stories of nonbinary folks on hormones, and trans timelines, and everything in my heart just sings with these stories. Except for one thing.\n\n**HAIR.**\n\nMaybe it\'s just a weird thing that I\'m projecting/focusing on, but every single thing sounds great except for *hair growth*. I don\'t have a problem with hair on anyone else but myself. I\'ve spent many years giving it a shot going all natural and I hated it. I shave my arms, my legs, my pits, and I do dainty landscaping on my fun zone. This is a constant- whether I\'m feeling as femme as a disney princess or when I\'m ready to just grow a cock already- I\'ve always felt the most comfortable being femme, even when I\'d prefer my body wasn\'t *female.* It\'s entirely possible that it would be a total moot point- that if I started T and began to look less female, it would be easier to accept body hair, but I\'m not sure yet! The one that really holds me back is facial hair, though. I really don\'t want it. Like ever. I don\'t want to shave my face, or deal with stubble. Also when I have that thought, I feel like a bad trans person for hating the idea so vehemently :(\n\nSo I\'m curious- what is hair growth like on T? Or, what is it like removing larger areas of hair? Is it a giant pain in the ass? Is there a way to nuke baby \'stache hairs from orbit as they first grow in to ensure they never return?', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""Hi!

I'm in that questioning/self discovery phase of my life. I *know* I'm somewhere within the genderqueer family, but I'm still trying to figure out who I actually am. I'm AFAB, but I'm not totally sure if I identify as female (and just present as more masculine) or if I'm something else.

I recently watched [this video](https://youtu.be/Zg9y3cKDAmI) and in it, she talks about asking yourself *why* you do certain things. Like *why* do you shave/grow out your hair, or *why* do you wear certain things.

I liked this idea, and started applying it to myself. But the issue I'm running across is I can't tell if I'm doing some things because that's what I like to do, or because I have 26 years of society telling me how to be female.

An example (and probably a bad one) is shaving. I shave my arm pits because it's what I'm used to, but also because I smell *awful* (even with strong men's deodorants) if I don't shave my armpits.

But when it comes to shaving my legs, it's a toss up. On the one hand, I shave my legs because I like the feeling of smooth legs (I HATE wearing shorts and feeling my hairy legs rub together). But then I'm wondering if it's just because I got so used to society telling my that's how women's legs should feel.

On the other hand, I'm extremely lazy and I often allow my leg hair to grow pretty long, especially in the winter, because I absolutely HATE shaving, and often wish it were acceptable for women to not shave.

But, for this example, I keep thinking ""Do I shave because society has always told me I should shave? Or do I shave because I want to shave? Do I not shave in the winter because I like having hairy legs? Or just because I'm lazy as shit?""

I'm sort of over thinking everything, I think, but I also believe deep introspection is good for me.

I always present as male mostly because I don't think the people I know would understand if I told them I would rather present as female (no one in my family does, for a start), and I tend to enjoy interaction with girls more than with guys to the point that sometimes men kind of intimidate me (although I like nerds of any gender).

10,2016-06-08 00:40:18,4n2cli,7,11,"This was a surprisingly powerful experience for me.  I'm sharing it in the hopes that it will help other fluid people who, like me, are new at this and are still finding their feet.  

A few days ago, I woke up with the strangest feeling: I was feeling both very feminine and very un-feminine at the same time.  Not feminine and masculine.  Feminine and not feminine.  There *is* a difference.  I also felt some vague body dysphoria.  Usually I know what part of my body is ""wrong,"" but this time I couldn't tell why; it was just wrong.  Most of the time it's my male chest, but the thought of having breasts actually made me feel worse, so it definitely wasn't that.

I took a nice shower, shaved my face and my legs, and hid my beard shadow with makeup - all things that usually help me feel better on feminine days.  They helped, but it wasn't enough.

When I go out of the house, I almost always present masculine, since I'm not yet totally confident presenting however I want in public.  On this day, though, that just wasn't acceptable.  I didn't want to present fully feminine, but the thought of going masculine just gave me a gross feeling.  I couldn't force myself to do it, not this time.

So I went digging through my wardrobe and came out with a pale red men's collared short-sleeve shirt, slim navy necktie, black denim skirt, and black trilby.  Didn't have any shoes that made sense, so I just wore my usual sneakers.  Added a little more makeup to brighten my face a little.  Looked myself over and was just amazed.  Even though it was just thrown together, it was **perfect.**  My dysphoria surprisingly evaporated, and I went out to run my errands with confidence, just loving the way I looked.

I've never presented in such a deliberately queer way, but this was my day to do it.  I felt like I was showing the world exactly how I felt.  Plus, I've found a new style of outfit that really suits me.

This is not the first time I've had a gender-scrambled day, but it's the first time I've found a way to own it and channel that confusion into something positive.

Later I reflected on why a few strips of fabric had such a profound impact on my state of mind.  I think choosing an outfit *really is* a form of self-expression, something I never really considered much before I identified as fluid.  It's a way to let those confusing and frustrating thoughts out of my head and show the world what I'm feeling, even if they don't get it.

More importantly, though, **it gave me confidence** in my identity and my gender expression.  Taking one of my worst gender days and finding a way to beat it - there was no way in hell I could just hide indoors after a victory like that.  I had to get out and be proud of myself, and doing that has had a permanent positive effect on my self-confidence and self-esteem.

Basically, he said this: ""Being gay myself, I understand  that a lot of people who identify as neither male or female, but  either both, a shift between the two, or neither,  tend to feel this way as a result of people telling others to act a certain way that's appropriate to their sex.""

I've heard a lot of feminists bring this up, but sweep this belief under the rug as to keep their alliance with the non-binary community. And to be honest, what sparked my own identity was the fact I myself never saw myself adequate enough or deserving to have the body I have. Part of me  actually had a transgender lean, while another part of me felt  comfortable and appreciative with what I was born with.

But that goes to question, do you think if gender-expression was more laiessz-faire, and people didn't enforce so many rules regarding what it means to ""Be a man"" or ""Be a woman,"" do you think the definition of nonbinary identities would exist? or would you think that  the expression would be there, but nobody would care to enforce the whole ""manly/womanly"" aspect?

1) What is the difference between a person's personality and their gender? 

-- My Guess/Answer: Anyone of any gender can be confident. If you are feminine, you would be confident in a feminine way. If you are masculine, you'd do it in a masculine. Any third genders would do it in their own gender's way. 

2) What is the difference between ""things you like"" and your gender? For example, if you like feminine clothes, does that make you partially feminine or is it how you ACT in those clothes and the WAY you enjoy them that is your gender?

-- I have no idea.

3) What is genderfluidity? Do I have one self that exists at all times but depending on ""mood"" factors in the body changes my preferences and expression? Or is my gender literally CHANGING from time to time?

-- I think the first one?

4) What biologically is genderfluidity? Why on earth would my gender be changing from time to time, seemingly randomly for random durations?

-- No idea again.

5) What does genderless mean? 

-- It almost seems to imply that gender is a 1D scale/spectrum between masculine and feminine, which seems really wrong. To me, gender is an infinite plane in all directions with two very common points, those being masculine and feminine. It sort of gets back to my first question.

6) Can you develop new genders as you grow? For example, on a 1-10 scale of femininity, I don't think I get much higher than an 8 at the very most. Would spending more time around feminine people change that? Would embracing it more possibly affect my gender itself?

Hi! This is my first post here.

I'm genderfluid (hopefully that went without saying), though I have more of a non-binary experience with it: I feel like a blend of genders and land on androgyny most days, with periods of feeling more masc/femme. 

I'm out, but mostly express feminine out of convenience (I was afab and have an ""hourglass"" figure...nice for expressing female, annoying when going andro/masc). I use female pronouns (again, out of convenience; I'm actually not picky about them), I don't experience a ton of dysphoria, and I don't feel the desire/need to go through HRT or surgery of any kind...never have. Honestly, because I can pass as cis pretty well, the hardest part of being genderfluid for me is when I feel unable to express the way I want to/feel.

So: I'm in a long-term relationship with a cisgender, straight man. We're recently engaged and have been together for four years. I came out (to him and myself and everyone) about three years ago, when I was 22, and he got visibly uncomfortable and basically refused to have the conversation.  Having been young and pretty fresh out of an abusive relationship, I defaulted to making myself uncomfortable for his benefit. I kinda just ignored my identity and dealt with occasionally feeling like an imposter-queer.

Now that we're engaged, I'm realizing that, holy shit, I love this man, but I do NOT want to live my entire private life in the closet! Especially since, if he isn't around, I'm extremely happy and open about my gender and sexuality...I feel more afraid/worried to be out in my own home, which is super-duper dissonant and weird and unhealthy. When that bubbled back up to the surface recently, I broached the topic with him again (not the first time since I originally came out, but not quite commonplace, either).

It did not go well. He became upset and uncomfortable, even tearing up and refusing to look at me, and said he wasn't sure he could ever be comfortable with having a partner who isn't straight-up female. I asked why--again, I don't want surgery or HRT or male pronouns or like literally anything but to feel free to look handsome af every so often--and he started listing all this stuff that, honestly, didn't make much sense to me: What if I decide I want to pack? (So? Then I get a silicone dick and I pack. You don't have to touch it.) What if I feel masculine on our wedding day? (Well, wedding dresses are expensive. My fluidity isn't so uncontrollable that I'll say ""fuck it"" to $1k and go for slacks instead.)

I answered these questions as best I could and he was still really upset. So I told him to continue asking any questions or voicing any concerns as they came up, and that I'd answer to the best of my ability. Since then, I've been gently referring him to blogs and articles and the like from both genderfluid people and their cis partners, hoping something would resonate and that his discomfort might just be from fear of the unknown, so to speak. 

That also hasn't really worked. To his credit, he's been way better about broaching the topic and responding to me when I send him a resource, but it hasn't actually changed his response: he always, to some degree, panics, and reiterates that he isn't sure he can be comfortable with it (though he says he is willing to try).

What do I do? I've, of course, been doing some reading of my own by non-binary folks who have had similar experiences. They're all similar: Not understanding but being willing to learn is one thing. Not accepting, not respecting, or being uncomfortable with is another, and you should cut your losses.

Guys, I love this man. But I can't marry someone who isn't going to be able to support and accept my identity. I want to explore myself (I'm only 25, for goodness' sake) and experiment with binding and packing and all that good stuff, without feeling like my partner is actively grossed out.

Any advice? I can't stop crying. It's totally my fault for not pushing the issue three years ago, and lesson learned. But still, this SUCKS.

So my situation is this: AMAB, 22yo and I think I'm genderfluid. I don't know exactly when this started, I got involved in some light bdsm and by last summer I sometimes felt a desire to be feminized. 

And it's kind of all come to a head lately when I realised that this isn't just a kink, the idea of presenting as female really appeals to me. 

Unfortunately my situation means that I can't buy female clothing, or really alter my appearance in any meaningful way right now. But I'm hoping that will change completely before the end of the year :)

So why am I looking for friends? Well part of me feels that if I can't dress or look the way I'd like to sometimes, well at least it would be nice if I got to act more feminine when I felt that way.
