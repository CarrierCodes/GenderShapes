This study might be a good fit for you: 
• If you are willing to talk about your experiences with these two identities 
• You are 18 years of age and older 
• Identify (broadly) as being gender diverse (transgender or gender nonconforming) and on the Asperger’s/Autism spectrum.

please forgive if this is not the right place for this question, and let me know what to do to fix that if so. i am brand new to reddit.

i am a low-income, biracial, disabled non-binary adult living in the U.S. my question is, does anyone know of an online forum for survivors of sexual assault ***that is inclusive of non-binary survivors***?  recently i was really struggling, i called the trans lifeline, they directed me to aftersilence.org... but to register for AS forums, one must select gender, either male or female. i was heartbroken when i saw that.

i was also directed to FORGE, but i've previously tried to get on their listserv and no one ever emailed me back :(. they don't have a forum. i see that they have publications and already plan to read them through, but it already feels like they round people off to ""ftm-vector"" and ""mtf-vector"" that leaves me still feeling excluded so there's that.

anyway. if you know of any other resources that'd be great. i've previously contacted RAINN, NCAVP, all sorts of places and come up short. the main thing i'm looking for is a resource for sexual assault survivors (an *interactive* resource, like a forum or chat), where someone can vouch that yes, they are inclusive of non-binary folks. thanks in advance",NonBinary,resources for non-binary survivors?,1473039555.0,"{'created_utc': 1473014355, 'id': '515ar1', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 7, 'selftext': 'hi everyone-\n\nplease forgive if this is not the right place for this question, and let me know what to do to fix that if so. i am brand new to reddit.\n\ni am a low-income, biracial, disabled non-binary adult living in the U.S. my question is, does anyone know of an online forum for survivors of sexual assault ***that is inclusive of non-binary survivors***?  recently i was really struggling, i called the trans lifeline, they directed me to aftersilence.org... but to register for AS forums, one must select gender, either male or female. i was heartbroken when i saw that.\n\ni was also directed to FORGE, but i\'ve previously tried to get on their listserv and no one ever emailed me back :(. they don\'t have a forum. i see that they have publications and already plan to read them through, but it already feels like they round people off to ""ftm-vector"" and ""mtf-vector"" that leaves me still feeling excluded so there\'s that.\n\nanyway. if you know of any other resources that\'d be great. i\'ve previously contacted RAINN, NCAVP, all sorts of places and come up short. the main thing i\'m looking for is a resource for sexual assault survivors (an *interactive* resource, like a forum or chat), where someone can vouch that yes, they are inclusive of non-binary folks. thanks in advance', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'resources for non-binary survivors?', 'created': 1473039555.0}"

(also sorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes as english is not my first language)
Let's begin: I am a girl and I have a very serious relationship with F., born female that identifies as nonbinary/genderfluid/doesn't really know.
I feel like F. is my one true love, we've known each other for almost 8 years know, we dated when we were 18 and now are in a more mature relationship after some time apart (we are 24/25 now). When we started dating again two years ago F. told me right away about the nonbinary thing and that has never been a problem with me. I love when they wear make up and I love when they wear baggy menswear. Today F. started a gofundme campain to try to get some money to buy a binder. That unexpectedly totally freaked me out and I am afraid I hurt F's feelings.
I know that it'll sound really selfish but I'm afraid that the binding could be the beginning of a female to male transition and that I might not find F. attractive in male form. I find the male body very unsettling and it actually grosses me out, I have absolutely no problem with androginous appearence though.
I fear that F's well beeing and my well beeing might not be compatible in the lifelong relationship I've always imagined, and I don't know how to express that or even if it's right if I do. I want to be with F. and support them but at the moment I don't really know how, that's why I'm writing here, I need some good advice on what to do. And please tell me that I'm not a horrible person for being scared about our future.

Most of the people I know that identify as nonbinary are, well, biologically female. This seems to be consistent throughout real life, online friends, both online and offline lgbt-friendly communities, etc.


I've come to realize that over time, because of my experiences, I have somehow stereotyped nonbinary self-identification as a ""girl"" thing. Whenever I see someone online declare themselves as nb, a lightning thought goes: ""its probably a woman"". I hate that my brain does this automatic tic. But on some sort of subconscious level, my brain seems to have reasoned that ""nonbinary"" developed primarily because society's narrow limitations on their gender create an image that women don't want to be forced into or associated with. Same thing for nonbinary men, but since society gives men less trouble in general, theres much, much fewer nb men. Idk, I get kind of douchey inside cause my reasoning goes: ""they're still technically female, they just don't like stereotypically girly things. That doesn't mean they're something else. A woman can be whatever she wants, your gender doesn't define you, you dont need to disassociate yourself from it to act the way you want""


The twist is...I'm a trans man. Those kinds of excuses were what my parents would say to discredit me when I first came out to them. These were the kinds of excuses I made to myself throughout high school trying to come to terms with my identity, only for it to ring hollow. I've been tortured over gender identity my whole life. Being misgendered sucks. So thoughts like this make no sense to me. How could I finally start unraveling my own dysphoria and then shit on other people's, especially when a lot of it coincides with my own fears: what if ""I'm not actually trans, I'm just trying to run away from social standards of womanhood"", what if I'm just a...cowardly woman.

It's not that these feelings have never existed until now, I just grew up in a culture of suppressing what others may see as weakness. I grew up in a very traditional yet somewhat open minded Roman Catholic family. When I came out as a lesbian my family accepted me right away and I had a somewhat smooth transition into living and loving how I wanted.

Yet throughout my entire life I've always felt like it didn't just simply stop at being gay. I always felt this nagging insecurity that I couldn't quite peg. The older I got the more masculine my appearance became and each step I took towards that appearance felt right. Yet at the same time I carried myself in a slightly feminine manner. I enjoyed both. I identified with both. It always left me feeling very uneasy.

Over the years I chalked it up to just being butch, but I've been experiencing some strong dysphoria these past couple of years. I'm 24. My hips have gotten more defined and I no longer have that slim flat body. The things that make me noticeably female make me hide. I don't fit into the male clothes like I used to. But I haven't come to the desire of wanting to be a full blown male. I don't mind my female pronoun. I'd prefer a more gender neutral name. And I enjoy my genitalia and have no desire to change it. My main dysphoria right now is concentrated in my breasts and hips.

I feel comfortable now to be out as non-binary. To me it's so liberating to find the space and answers of where I belong. What lane I'm in. 

I would appreciate any advice as I'm going to start binding for the first time. My wife is unbelievably supportive and I feel like I'm finally at that point where I've accepted who I am and am just ready to be comfortable in my skin.

The issue is that it seems no matter what I do, I still read as female. Which wouldn't be a problem if people didn't feel like pointing it out all the time. I guess it's because I often move through male dominated spaces. 

Just today I was playing a game. I noted that the art on a card depicting creatures hiding in a wheel was kinda cute. The guy said ""I've only heard women say that. Us guys notice the big wheels"" or something like that. It kinda killed me a bit on the inside.

The thing is, I feel like I don't have any right to feel this way because I don't 100% everyday strive to make my identity obvious. I have long hair that I've kept long because it's fly as hell, and while I know men with long hair exist it's something I feel that would help if I did cut it. My face issuer round and feminine, which I can sorta change with makeup and maybe intensive gym workouts? I wear masculine clothes, I was wearing masculine clothes in this particular moment (no binder but I was wearing several layers and felt lazy/didn't want to die).

Things like how a women or man should act, feel, dress or think. That one must drastically change their appearance to conform to socially acceptable ideas of masculinity/feminist. I'm sure most do it for themselves and not to please anyone or get attention. As a fellow human I truly wish to believe that. But to say you identify as a woman or a man... What does that mean? Does saying, I want to look like a woman or feel like a man make any sense if you disregard the act of sex? 

I don't believe anyone who says they understand what a trans person is going through who isn't trans or a mental health specialist. How could they? I admit I don't understand what gender identity is and based on what I've read, you would need a degree to even begin to.
I can understand homosexuality on a level to where I'll defend it. However when one gender says they want to live as another, isn't that purely aesthetic? 

Hypothetically if a father comes out as trans and their child asks why their daddy looks like that, is it appropriate to say because that makes him feel better? If the child asks why again what would you say.
I am in no way trying to say trans people shouldn't be parents or live a life they want to. A good parent is a good parent. I'm just calling into question the affect of a person changing their appearance to feel comfortable with themselves and accepted by others. Is one dependent on the other? If you truly did not care what people think, why would you care what you look like?

However when one gender says they want to live as another, isn\'t that purely aesthetic? \n\nHypothetically if a father comes out as trans and their child asks why their daddy looks like that, is it appropriate to say because that makes him feel better? If the child asks why again what would you say.\nI am in no way trying to say trans people shouldn\'t be parents or live a life they want to. A good parent is a good parent. I\'m just calling into question the affect of a person changing their appearance to feel comfortable with themselves and accepted by others. Is one dependent on the other? If you truly did not care what people think, why would you care what you look like?\n\nShoot I\'m all over the place. I have nothing but love for people who show me the same.

21,2016-09-16 08:21:55,530xmh,2,11,"I'm not sure where else to put this. 

I'm writing this from my phone on the bed of a hospital gurney. 

I'm active duty military, united States Navy for 4 years (5 in Oct). I've suspected myself of having gender dysphoria for over two years after the recommendation of a friend, but have only recently begun to look into it and actually seek help. 

Too little too late. 

I went behind my command's back because I didn't want anyone to know, and have been seeking out help for the last few days. I had a psych evaluation on the 26th (still do I think). 

Until yesterday my mom and a few close friends were the only ones that knew I was possibly trans. I say possibly even though it's there without a doubt in my mind after much consideration over the last two years only because I haven't been properly diagnosed. Gender dysphoria may not be the only thing that's wrong with me, as I have plenty of anger issues, and anxiety issues. Something along the lines of borderline personality disorder. Something that i personally (though I'm not a doctor, so this is just opinion) believe is not directly related to my dysphoria, while there are a lot of things that are associated with my dysphoria. 

Anyway the past few days have been really hard for me. Starting with my attempts to seek out help, I first went to the active duty chaplain, which took me two months to finally find the courage to go see. I didn't feel comfortable mentioning my dysphoria to someone religious, but I did understand that he was there to help regardless of the problem, so while talking to him, which was over hundred percent guaranteed to be confidential, I explained most of my issues regarding possible BPD. Fourty minutes in and he resorted to recommending me to mental health professionals, and I had only just began to touch on my issues. 

The thing that had finally driven me to seek out help was urgings by the only friend I really consistently talk with anymore, who has had to deal with these kinds of things before with their trans sister. My other friends were all driven away by my out bursts recently. One of these friends, who I cared for deeply, was driven to suicide by my hateful words. Someone that cared for them was telling them to kill themselves. That's where I drew the line. Luckily they didn't go through with it, but they were staring down the barrel of a gun because of me and my instabilities. 

I went to see military mental health specialists, but unfortunately I was unable to see an actual doctor because as you can imagine the Navy and the military in general is filled with fucked up people, thus all the doctors were booked until the 26th. Life creeps up on you when you barely make 30k a year working more than anyone else will their whole lives over the course of a few years. 

I joined the Navy to ""man up"". To get stronger, mentally and physically. It's only served to do the opposite. I've always been a bit of a weakling, especially in my own eyes. My lack of masculinity was a crippling self esteem issue. No matter how hard I tried no matter how thin or bulked up I would get, though, I never was any happier with how I looked. Even dressing nice as a male was never really ever satisfying. 

Sorry to change topics out of no where but I've been playing video games online via the PC since I was a teen. I've played girl characters the whole way. Not because I was a pervy kid and liked tits and ass as much as I tried to convince myself that was the reason, but it was because that's who I wanted to be. Video games were a huge source of escape for me. I was your typical computer nerd, as anti social as they come. In game I was bubbly and happy as could be though. If it weren't for my tendency to push people away I think I would have turned out to be a rather popular person. 

Anyway back to the main point. Maybe I'll edit this later and put more in. 

The reason I'm on a hospital bed tonight writing this on a throwaway account is because I attempted to take my own life the night prior (the 14th). I didn't actually go through with it. All I had  to do it with was a knife, and when I went to cut my wrist open the long way, all I could do was scratch myself. I had lost all the strength in my body. The worst cut barely went into the skin and there wasn't even enough blood to be a big deal. My strength is actually still really questionable. Every day tasks are really hard for me, it's like when you're sick and your whole body just aches, and even just breathing is a chore. I tried to take a bandaid off the EMTs had put on my finger and I just couldn't do it. Or open a can of soda, for that matter. I'm not sure why this happened, and I sadly can't say that I feel fortunate that it turned out this way. 

It's taken a while to get through my head and actually turn into something meaningful, but my co-workers and friends were up all night searching for me. I had utterly trashed my room and written in mustard (as I'm writing this it's hilarious thinking about it in hindsight) on the walls and floor, my suicide note. ""Fuck my command, I'm going to kill myself"".

By the way the reason I flipped my shit is because I had failed room inspection of my barracks room. Not that big of a deal. The room wasn't necessarily dirty, just could be touched up here and there. Not a big deal. I've failed one before for less, like not having my closet locked up properly. In hindsight it was really ridiculous to flip out over such a thing, and to the level that I did. 

I threw cooking ingredients all over, broke a lot of stuff including mirrors and drawers, and slammed holes in the walls. Then I sent pictures of the mess to someone that was actually at work. I took two of my old iphones, one 4 and one 5s, threw them in the microwave and took off to get some McDonald's, it wasn't but a minute or two before the fire alarm went off, but luckily nothing bad happened. I looked in the kitchen area of the building and the microwave was still there, so luckily nothing bad came of it. Anyway I bought like fifty dollars worth of McDonald's and gorged myself. Oh and while I was trashing my room I downed like an eighth of a bottle of Smirnoff that I had been drinking over the last month or so, pretty much just finished it off. Didn't even show up in the blood work. 

Anyway I went out into a field where there is an obstacle course and hid there. Had my fifty dollar meal, and subsequently tried to kill myself, but couldn't. I was exhausted from the experience, and opted to just go to sleep. Slept for a couple hours on rocks dirt and dead grass, woke up a couple of times and heard people looking for me, even saw a helicopter do a couple passes. Guess I had a pretty good hiding spot. Wasnt until about one or two in the morning until my co-workers found me. The guy that I sent those pictures to had made a pretty big deal about all of this. For which I hope I can find it in myself to thank him but right now I just wish i was dead even more than before. 

Someone part of the LGBT community in our command, who I had reached out to anonymously in attempts to figure out tge Navy policies on transgender issuss, had even found out who I was (they knew who I was but didn't know my number and allowed me to stay anonymous)  and was also sending me texts throughout the whole thing. 


The only person I really talked to through all of this was my friend I mentioned with the trans sister. They were worried. Everyone was. I hate myself for doing this to them. Over something so pathetic. And acting so childishly. 

It was ridiculous how much they all cared. And how supportive they were of who I actually am. 

Anyway. 

Idk what the point of this was really. 

I'll answer questions if anyone has any. ",trans,worst days of my life.,1474039315.0,"{'created_utc': 1474014115, 'id': '530xmh', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 11, 'selftext': 'I\'m not sure where else to put this. \n\nI\'m writing this from my phone on the bed of a hospital gurney. \n\nI\'m active duty military, united States Navy for 4 years (5 in Oct). I\'ve suspected myself of having gender dysphoria for over two years after the recommendation of a friend, but have only recently begun to look into it and actually seek help. \n\nToo little too late. \n\nI went behind my command\'s back because I didn\'t want anyone to know, and have been seeking out help for the last few days. I had a psych evaluation on the 26th (still do I think). \n\nUntil yesterday my mom and a few close friends were the only ones that knew I was possibly trans. I say possibly even though it\'s there without a doubt in my mind after much consideration over the last two years only because I haven\'t been properly diagnosed. Gender dysphoria may not be the only thing that\'s wrong with me, as I have plenty of anger issues, and anxiety issues. Something along the lines of borderline personality disorder. Something that i personally (though I\'m not a doctor, so this is just opinion) believe is not directly related to my dysphoria, while there are a lot of things that are associated with my dysphoria. \n\nAnyway the past few days have been really hard for me. Starting with my attempts to seek out help, I first went to the active duty chaplain, which took me two months to finally find the courage to go see. I didn\'t feel comfortable mentioning my dysphoria to someone religious, but I did understand that he was there to help regardless of the problem, so while talking to him, which was over hundred percent guaranteed to be confidential, I explained most of my issues regarding possible BPD. Fourty minutes in and he resorted to recommending me to mental health professionals, and I had only just began to touch on my issues. \n\nThe thing that had finally driven me to seek out help was urgings by the only friend I really consistently talk with anymore, who has had to deal with these kinds of things before with their trans sister. My other friends were all driven away by my out bursts recently. One of these friends, who I cared for deeply, was driven to suicide by my hateful words. Someone that cared for them was telling them to kill themselves. That\'s where I drew the line. Luckily they didn\'t go through with it, but they were staring down the barrel of a gun because of me and my instabilities. \n\nI went to see military mental health specialists, but unfortunately I was unable to see an actual doctor because as you can imagine the Navy and the military in general is filled with fucked up people, thus all the doctors were booked until the 26th. Life creeps up on you when you barely make 30k a year working more than anyone else will their whole lives over the course of a few years. \n\nI joined the Navy to ""man up"". To get stronger, mentally and physically. It\'s only served to do the opposite. I\'ve always been a bit of a weakling, especially in my own eyes. My lack of masculinity was a crippling self esteem issue. No matter how hard I tried no matter how thin or bulked up I would get, though, I never was any happier with how I looked. Even dressing nice as a male was never really ever satisfying. \n\nSorry to change topics out of no where but I\'ve been playing video games online via the PC since I was a teen. I\'ve played girl characters the whole way. Not because I was a pervy kid and liked tits and ass as much as I tried to convince myself that was the reason, but it was because that\'s who I wanted to be. Video games were a huge source of escape for me. I was your typical computer nerd, as anti social as they come. In game I was bubbly and happy as could be though. If it weren\'t for my tendency to push people away I think I would have turned out to be a rather popular person. \n\nAnyway back to the main point. Maybe I\'ll edit this later and put more in. \n\nThe reason I\'m on a hospital bed tonight writing this on a throwaway account is because I attempted to take my own life the night prior (the 14th). I didn\'t actually go through with it. All I had  to do it with was a knife, and when I went to cut my wrist open the long way, all I could do was scratch myself. I had lost all the strength in my body. The worst cut barely went into the skin and there wasn\'t even enough blood to be a big deal. My strength is actually still really questionable. Every day tasks are really hard for me, it\'s like when you\'re sick and your whole body just aches, and even just breathing is a chore. I tried to take a bandaid off the EMTs had put on my finger and I just couldn\'t do it. Or open a can of soda, for that matter. I\'m not sure why this happened, and I sadly can\'t say that I feel fortunate that it turned out this way. \n\nIt\'s taken a while to get through my head and actually turn into something meaningful, but my co-workers and friends were up all night searching for me. I had utterly trashed my room and written in mustard (as I\'m writing this it\'s hilarious thinking about it in hindsight) on the walls and floor, my suicide note. ""Fuck my command, I\'m going to kill myself"".\n\nBy the way the reason I flipped my shit is because I had failed room inspection of my barracks room. Not that big of a deal. The room wasn\'t necessarily dirty, just could be touched up here and there. Not a big deal. I\'ve failed one before for less, like not having my closet locked up properly. In hindsight it was really ridiculous to flip out over such a thing, and to the level that I did. \n\nI threw cooking ingredients all over, broke a lot of stuff including mirrors and drawers, and slammed holes in the walls. Then I sent pictures of the mess to someone that was actually at work. I took two of my old iphones, one 4 and one 5s, threw them in the microwave and took off to get some McDonald\'s, it wasn\'t but a minute or two before the fire alarm went off, but luckily nothing bad happened. I looked in the kitchen area of the building and the microwave was still there, so luckily nothing bad came of it. Anyway I bought like fifty dollars worth of McDonald\'s and gorged myself. Oh and while I was trashing my room I downed like an eighth of a bottle of Smirnoff that I had been drinking over the last month or so, pretty much just finished it off. Didn\'t even show up in the blood work. \n\nAnyway I went out into a field where there is an obstacle course and hid there. Had my fifty dollar meal, and subsequently tried to kill myself, but couldn\'t. I was exhausted from the experience, and opted to just go to sleep. Slept for a couple hours on rocks dirt and dead grass, woke up a couple of times and heard people looking for me, even saw a helicopter do a couple passes. Guess I had a pretty good hiding spot. Wasnt until about one or two in the morning until my co-workers found me. The guy that I sent those pictures to had made a pretty big deal about all of this. For which I hope I can find it in myself to thank him but right now I just wish i was dead even more than before. \n\nSomeone part of the LGBT community in our command, who I had reached out to anonymously in attempts to figure out tge Navy policies on transgender issuss, had even found out who I was (they knew who I was but didn\'t know my number and allowed me to stay anonymous)  and was also sending me texts throughout the whole thing. \n\n\nThe only person I really talked to through all of this was my friend I mentioned with the trans sister. They were worried. Everyone was. I hate myself for doing this to them. Over something so pathetic. And acting so childishly. \n\nIt was ridiculous how much they all cared. And how supportive they were of who I actually am. \n\nAnyway. \n\nIdk what the point of this was really. \n\nI\'ll answer questions if anyone has any.

# Every day I post an instance where /r/the_donald harassed or threatened violence against transgender individuals. Here's the subreddit stalking and harassing one individual person. 

The subreddit /r/the_donald found a photo of a person and then stalked and harassed this person. This person was just a bystander who they targeted because they believed they have the appearance of transgender person and they think they are ""ugly"". This person may not even be transgender but /r/the_donald labelled this person as transgender as bigoted motivation to stalk and harass them. No one deserves this.

This has clearly escalated way out of control. The subreddit started a hate campaign against a random bystander and promoted finding this person and taking photos and videos of them. This is dangerous behavior. This is more than a violation of site rules. This is a violation of an individual's personal safety. Something needs to be done to stop this.

We know that this is on his/her (will not give any pronoun preference to us) mind through web searches done on my old laptop left in the dining room.   

We have helped with shopping in young men's for shirts, jeans, and underwear. We have ordered binders online. It isn't just a gender roles thing.  

I think that it is trying out various aspects and is part of self exploration and discovery.  

I try to reiterate that we are fine with whatever. Either gender. Neither gender. Bouncing about. But it feels like we need to do more.  

We do know that a childhood best friend (now a significant other) is FTM. We are pretty open. I grew up with someone who was transexual and had reassignment surgery (MTF). I have friends in many aspects of the LGBTQ continuum, but strangely not FTM. Her mother (not my wife) has a more diverse friend group than I do.  

That is a lot of detail. Most largely unimportant. Ugh. Sorry.  

So I am asking for any resources you could recommend. For any of us. Online as there isn't much in this area.  

Any recommendations on how to make this something we can talk about. Talking in the car so we aren't facing each other seems to help a bit. Reiterating love and acceptance seems to be something she appreciates, but doesn't change her desire to not talk.

Lastly, binders are expensive. Daaaaayuum. Any advice on what brands or retailers would be great. Any advice on other things that might increase comfort would be great. So far just shopping for clothes I would have bought 10-20 years ago seem to be very popular (as does the resulting layering).  

Sorry it is a bit uncoordinated. Not sure what to ask, but I could use some help. Trying to let her take her pace for the last few years has not been productive. The most progress has been when we just suggest things (How about we order a binder? Let's go look in the men's section for a bit. Etc.).

Her mother (not my wife) has a more diverse friend group than I do.  \n\nThat is a lot of detail. Most largely unimportant. Ugh. Sorry.  \n\nSo I am asking for any resources you could recommend. For any of us. Online as there isn't much in this area.  \n\nAny recommendations on how to make this something we can talk about. Talking in the car so we aren't facing each other seems to help a bit. Reiterating love and acceptance seems to be something she appreciates, but doesn't change her desire to not talk.\n\nLastly, binders are expensive. Daaaaayuum. Any advice on what brands or retailers would be great. Any advice on other things that might increase comfort would be great. So far just shopping for clothes I would have bought 10-20 years ago seem to be very popular (as does the resulting layering).  \n\nSorry it is a bit uncoordinated. Not sure what to ask, but I could use some help. Trying to let her take her pace for the last few years has not been productive. The most progress has been when we just suggest things (How about we order a binder? Let's go look in the men's section for a bit. Etc.). \n\nThanks either way.

Just need to have a bit of a feelings rant and wondering anyone feels similar. AMAB on/off HRT for a couple of years.

I'm back off estrogen briefly to consider my options. It's been 3 weeks and I'm back to thinking about going back on them.

I think what I've been having problems with is that while for the most part having a feminine body would be fantastic (if I could hit a button that transformed me into what I would be if I'd been born female, I would), the thought of being visibly trans and nonbinary has been my roadblock. Yay internalised transphobia :'(

As my presentation changes toward feminine a lot of my identity and certain aspects remain masculine. Particularly my general demeanor, voice and singing voice. I guess I just feel the societal pressure of what I 'should' be doing to meet expectations of the binary and not stand out and it goes against the way I feel. And that is causing issues.

And I know I shouldn't care about societal expectations but they are a big part of our conditioning and as someone who has self esteem issues and is always looking for validation I've often clung to them. It also doesn't help that I'm quite the looker when doing the usual expected masculine presentation. And that also comes with lots of privileges. 

And it sort of comes down to whether having a feminine body is worth the societal issues Ill have to deal with. And I guess I know deep down it is... I'm just having trouble committing to that path for myself.

What stood out for me recently regarding my feelings was when I went to the endo to discuss other treatments like SERMs, to get the feminisation but not breast growth. I guess the not wanting breast growth is partly because once I have them I can't as easily hide in man mode. And partly because there are times when I do enjoy a masculine appearance and they would make that difficult. 

But when he was talking about not getting the feminisation on them (SERMs) that I would get on E and the fact the growth I have now would probably revert a bit, I internally freaked out. 

In the end he printed me a script I've yet to use. At the moment I'm just on blockers. And I'm mentally exhausted from this inner conflict.

that said, i identify strongly with the lesbian community and am afraid of being alienated from it if i'm too masculine. asides from that (which could be my internalized cissexism speaking), i really don't want a deeper voice, hair loss, or being on hormones for the rest of my life. so i'm avoiding hormones.

26,2016-09-08 17:17:48,51serk,0,5,"I'm 23 years old, agender/genderqueer, and in a long-term relationship with a pansexual transwoman that didn't know she was trans when I met her. Since my girlfriend moved in with me last year, she's been able to fully experiment with her gender identity for the first time, and she told me about a month ago that she feels that she strictly identifies as female now.

The relationship is interesting, to say the least, because she is pansexual but tends to be more attracted to the feminine region of the gender spectrum. Meanwhile, I currently present a bit heavier on the andro side of androgyny, and am pretty exclusively attracted to the masculine region of the gender spectrum. Had I met my girlfriend after she had started to transition, I'm not sure if I would've been interested in pursuing a sexual/romantic relationship with her. This does have me question whether or not our relationship has an expiration date, because I have absolutely no intention of holding my girlfriend back from transitioning however fully she would like to (which currently at least includes hormone treatment). I have no doubt that I love her and care about her deeply, but I wonder if the sexual component of that will change further into my girlfriend's transition. For the time being, I'm just keeping an open mind and doing my best to support her.

For what it's worth, my girlfriend and I recently had a conversation about our respective genders, and I've had lingering doubts about my ability to impress my gender identity upon others. After my girlfriend affirmed what had already mostly been confirmed, she told me (without any real prompting) that she didn't really see me as having any particular gender (although I'm AMAB). To get that kind of acknowledgement from my partner was very refreshing, and it renewed my interest in developing my own identity further. So here I am!

Just to clarify, when I identified myself as ""agender/genderqueer"" at the start of my post, I didn't mean to imply that I think the two identities are interchangeable. If I had to use one term to more accurately describe myself, I would honestly call myself a ""gender troll"". I really get a kick out of messing with people's preconceived notions about gender, and while I don't think I have any particularly strong internal sense of gender (hence the ""agender"" half of my previous label), I do like to dip my toes into the theater of gender and play with it socially (hence the ""genderqueer"" part). Having written that out now, I do worry about how it relates to the old ""deceptive transwoman"" trope, because I certainly don't have any desire to perpetuate gross crap like that.

If anything, I'm very confident in the ""agendered"" aspect of my personality, but I feel like I want to do more with my presentation. On that front, I think I actually experience something along the lines of gender dysphoria in that I'm very sensitive about some of my more masculine features, since they're incongruous with how I want to be seen by others.

For me, I've tried having a more masculine mask in life. I can be interested enough in sports to have a decent time at a Super Bowl party or hanging out with friends watching a baseball game or a football game or something. I just don't feel like, when it comes to what most people think of when they think ""man"" I fit into that. I've tried to be more like that, and it makes unhappy.

Now, as for a feminine mask, I have certain physical attributes that make a feminine presentation a little hard to obtain. My hairline is very male. My face is kinda male. My body, despite some feminine leanings, is that of a guy's. I've made peace with this though.

What I talk about when I say I like the idea of having a feminine mask, it isn't the same as wanting to be a woman. Yes, there are times I want to be a woman, but they aren't as frequent as the times I feel like neither a man or a woman. I do like the flexibility aspect, however.

Not saying they don't catch crap, but women can typically express greater fluidity in their appearance and still be seen as ""normal women."" This is what I talk about when I say I have a more feminine identity, since I feel like femininity has a greater range of expression potential than masculinity, as femininity can borrow from masculinity a lot easier than the other way around.

I am finally getting to a point where I am feeling like I need to express myself more. It isn't a matter of necessarily ""finding myself,"" but that's a part of it. No, this is me saying ""I have always liked this stuff, I am just now allowing myself to actually express a like of it.""

Here's the effects I desire from HRT:

- The ceasing of hair and follicle growth on my face and the thinning/lightening of hair that is already there

- Thinning/lightening of the hair on my arms and legs

- The ceasing of hair and follicle growth on my chest, armpits, and torso

- Musculoskeletal changes to my face to create a slightly more feminine appearance

- Musculoskeletal changes to my body to create a less-masculine physique

- Prevention of testosterone from lowering my voice any further

- If possible, anything that could help raise the pitch of my voice

- Growth of breasts (I want my chest to remain relatively flat, if possible)

- Full-blown feminine body transformation

Its a long post (I like for people to know 100% and it feels nice to get it out) so bear with me! Apologies if it's super incoherent. It's a lot of backstory.

So my family lives in the USA but I got to uni in the UK. This whole summer I've been stressing about coming out (as FTM), because this year at uni I'm going to meet a whole new group of people, (I did a foundation year last year, and only a few people know me from then) and wanted to have my shit together NOW, so I could go through the rest of my time at uni with people just knowing me as a guy. Well, the thing is, I could never find a time to come out, and I waited till 2 days before I left again for uni and had a horrible panic attack afterwards. I came out with a letter (which I previously posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/4zh1je/coming_out_letter_to_my_family_critiques_highly/) ) Really, it's a mistake on my part for waiting so long and not having time to process and socially transition. Also, its because I don’t like change, and somehow I have it in my head that being out as trans is gonna change everything. And of course when I have a panic attack, I get what my sister and I call an ‘anxiety hangover’ which is general anxiety, lots of trouble eating, and a high heart rate for like a week after. The day after I came out (to just my mum and sister at this point) I emailed the registrar at my uni telling about the name change and stuff and she was super cool about it. Then the next day, in my crazy anxious state, reading the email suddenly made it so fucking real that I had to email her back and say “you know what change it back to my legal name”. On the subject of my anxiety and such, it's been a few weeks and I feel pretty much back to normal (besides the usual shit with leaving home and such)

After coming out to my mum and sister they seemed pretty ambivalent to it. My mum later showed my dad the letter I wrote and he has said NOTHING about it. Really the whole trans thing was mentioned 0 times the past few weeks and no one even tried with pronouns and names. I don't really care, because I understand that we were all just focused on the anxiety at the time. Well, my issue now is that I kinda panicked on my first day back at uni, and didn't come out to any of the people who knew me last year, and have been going by my birth name and female pronouns. It's awkward because some people who I haven't introduced myself to have been reading me as male, and then all the people who know me are like ""uhhhhhh she's a girl"". Gahhhhhh this is just such a stressful time, because on top of it all, I don't even know if I want to come out as FTM. That's why I'm posting this here, because I've flipped back and forth between identifying as genderqueer and FTM. Part of my issue with identifying as genderqueer is that society just isn't set up for non-binary genders and I don't want to deal with all that ""are you a boy or girl"" kinda stuff. I clearly couldn't handle coming out a few weeks ago, and idk if I ever will be able to. I do realise that I went about it the wrong way, trying to just flip a switch and socially transition in like, 3 days.

84,2016-09-22 07:07:56,53xtbx,16,16,"Hey all, this is my first time posting to this sub. I will preface this by saying this sub has really helped me discover and feel more confident in starting low dose T. 

Before, I didn't know that NB and genderqueer people like me did this sort of transition. I have always felt more masculine and can even remember crying when I started to grow breasts because I didn't want them. However, I do not identify as a man, and would not like to. I do wish to appear and even sound a little more masculine. 

I have been talking with my gf about starting T for a while now, and she is 100% supportive and even encouraged me to find a community to be apart of so I wouldn't feel so alone. She loves me a lot and tries her best to understand. However, she admitted she was afraid that I would stop being attracted to her and become attracted to men, like her FTM friend. She says her friend had girlfriends that he loved and lived with but then just started being into other guys. 

I told her I don't see this happening. I told her I straight up only have a desire for her. I have never been interested in guys. She then mentioned the fact that I watch gay porn...and not really straight porn. I told her that I've done that from a very young age and figured out later in life that I watched it out of envy. I wanted to look like them...not to mention I can barely stomach straight porn. But she knew that. I admitted I do watch tolerable straight porn at times. I also told her that a lot of times when I get off I think about her or us together.

Another concern she has is that I will be less soft and understanding with her. I told her I don't see this happening either. 

I love her with all my heart and no other woman compares. I'd appreciate some input from any NB and genderqueers.

I'm not sure where to start or how to start, so I'm just gonna... start. I recently came out as agender/genderfluid. I’ve experienced gender dysphoria and dysmorphia my entire life, ever since I was a child. I didn’t hate being a girl, not necessarily—but I hated my girl body, and I knew that my body was one that did not belong to me. I wanted to ""hack my breasts off"" from age 8 until I was about 14, and afterward, until I was 19 and learned about bigender/agender, I thought I was transgendered or just a very, very confused lesbian.


I've been talking with people about this lately, but not in a way where I feel like I can fully express myself and say everything want to... so. I really hope someone, somewhere will hear me out.


I am genderqueer, I'm pretty sure. I'm certainly sure. Actually, I'm positive, but I'm having a hard time coming to terms with it because of all the negativity surrounding it and I'm not sure how to cope.


I want top surgery, I want to dress like a man—or in all actuality, ambiguously, really, most of the time—and I want to have the suavity and mannerisms of a man. But I want to be pretty, too. Somedays I want to be soft and delicate. I want to do my makeup, occasionally treat myself to heels and dresses, grow out my hair, and all the things I’ve always done. I want to be femme fatale, but I want to be prince charming. But people just don’t get it. “Why do you want to go through all the trouble of trying to be a boy, but only if it’s sometimes?”

Cause that’s just how it is for me. I don’t know, I can’t explain it, and I’m not sure if I ever *will* be able to explain it. 

And honestly, that might be the most frustrating part. 

Sometimes I wonder if it's because societally, it's considered ""unacceptable"" for men to wear makeup, grow their hair, and to be interested in fashion that's not traditionally masculine. I wonder if men could dress and do whatever they want without any negative repercussions, if I'd feel differently about this, I'm not sure. But I'm often caught thinking to myself, ""how could any part of me want to be a guy, what kind of guy likes fashion and make-up?""

(I know that answer is many; I know plenty. but you know. That darn society. It tells me that if I like those things, I must be a girl, and a girl I must remain.)

When I was 16 and thought that I only had two choices and that gender was just black and white, I asked my brother (who was, really, my only family at the time) what he would do if I wanted to be a boy. He told me he would disown me; he asked God for a sister, not a brother, and I never said another word about it again until six months ago—I'm 23 now.

And six months ago, I tried to explain to my mom what gender fluidity was. Surprisingly, she claimed that she knew I was ""fluid between genders"", but she's still not comfortable with it, not completely, but in a way, I’m fine with it because she doesn’t really berate me for it either. She’s just confused. But whenever I try to bring it up—“hey mom, my therapist found some resources for me, she might’ve found a surgeon I can consult,” she just tries to use the counterargument that no man would ever love a woman without breasts. I should ""just get a reduction"", because God Forbid™.

I haven’t told my friends because they think it’s a joke—a tumblr joke, a made up thing that doesn't actually exist. Just an introductory adjective that ""special snowflakes"" use to make themselves seem interesting. I haven't told my boyfriend because he thinks the same way my friends do, and I didn't know that he was incredibly transphobic until recently. We've been together for two years, and I'm hopelessly in love. So I sacrifice that, or my true, internal happiness, and either way I lose.

To sum it up, a tl;dr:

I hate this. I hate feeling like I have to choose one or the other. I want to be neither or both, and when I say to someone that I want to be neither or both, I hate feeling like they don’t take me seriously or that this is just some kind of big joke or that I’m going through a phase even though I’m 23 years old and have felt this way for nearly 10 years. I don't fit in this body, I never have and I never will, and I've spent so long trying to claw my way out of it that I'm tired. I just want to live my life the way I've always envisioned it, happy. That's it, that's all.

97,2016-09-24 04:00:59,548mpi,6,6,"Hey all.

Long story short, I'm AFAB, and I've known something has been up with my gender since I was about 12 (I'm about to turn 20). I've always hated having breasts, and wearing womens clothes makes me feel like I'm cross-dressing.

That being said, I don't identify as 100% male, either. In fact, I think my problem is that I don't like strangers looking at me and immediately thinking ""boy"" or ""girl"", I just want them to think ""person"". Obviously, most of society doesn't work that way, which means that i'll just have to deal with it.

As i've had these feelings for about 8 years now, over the past few months I've begun to consider going on T. I would like a deeper voice, and facial hair, everything else is kind of ""whatever"". 

I've never been a ""girly-girl"", but I see women with light makeup, and I think ""wow! I wish I could look like that, if only I were less masculine."" Ex: [Missy Higgins](http://imgur.com/a/UfQzH) The thing is...there's nothing thats really stopping me from looking like that. But every time I wear women's clothes or makeup, I feel like I'm crossdressing, I just get a very weird sensation that something is wrong. 

On the other hand, I see guys like [Matthew Gray Gubler](http://imgur.com/a/qCg02) and I'm like YES. THATS WHAT I WANT. He's not super masc, which is what I envision myself to be like, if I ever went on T.

Does it sound like I'm just trying to mask my desire to go on T by saying that I want to be more feminine (something that I've NEVER been comfortable with)? Is that internalized transphobia? If so, any tips on getting over it?

I don't have many friends, but I've been out to all of them for a while, including my girlfriend.

My mom and sister know, and are really respectful. They accidentally outed me to the rest of my family at dinner once (grandparents, aunt and uncle) so they know, but my aunt said that she wouldn't believe it or use the right name/pronouns until I tell her myself. Everyone else generally ignored it.

I'm out to one of my managers at work, and have mentioned it in passing to other coworkers, but they still use my legal name while I'm at work because not many people know and it's also what's on all the paperwork/accounts there. I'm not even sure if my coworkers remember that I mentioned it.

I've had this itch to just come out on facebook for a while, get it out all at once, change the name and be done with it, deal with any hate/confusion later. My pronouns have been changed there for a while, but no one's questioned it.

It's just really hard having to switch names depending on whos around. I have some coworkers on facebook, but mostly its family and people I graduated high school with (but never talk to).

So I'm presently visiting some friends in Vegas, and because nobody else knows me for 400 miles in any direction, I decided to spend the trip presenting more feminine. It has been an amazing, mostly-positive few days, but I got off to a rough start.

The first day, I was in a long denim skirt and women's v-neck, but otherwise wasn't trying to ""pass"" or anything. At the restaurant where we met for lunch, some dudes who walked in to the restroom behind me decided to make really loud comments about how ""I guess that tr***y has to stop pretending some time"" and the like. It was the first time that particular slur was applied to me, and the first time I really felt unsafe presenting more feminine. I hid in the stall until they left. Fortunately this all happened after we paid. I don't know why I let them get to me, but I did, and I almost gave up on the whole project and stuck to men's clothing for the rest of the trip.

Then the next day I said ""fuck those assholes"" and went out in public in a dress for the first time. My wife and I ate lunch, went shopping, did some sightseeing, and nobody said a thing, although I definitely turned some heads. It was awesome and affirming and I am so glad that I didn't let a few assholes keep me from expressing myself.

I have recently started learning about genderqueer identities and wonder if this applies to me. This hasn't been a major issue in my life, but I have never actually felt like a 'man.' In terms of the traditional idea of what it means to be a man or male, I'm not really sure what that feels like, or what it should feel like. Whenever I heard this kind of language coming up from people or friends, it just made me very uncomfortable and didn't really connect. I never thought about this in terms of 'gender' because this kind of language makes plenty of other nonathletic or skinny kids uncomfortable. But in terms of how it might apply to a gender identity, or how being a man might feel, I just can't even grasp that as a concept, it feels foreign to me. I'm not sure if that's normal, or if it's a sign that I'm genderqueer.
The other thing is that I also don't like being the man in any sort of relationship, although I'm straight, I prefer my partner to be the more masculine one. This is especially confusing because I'm attracted to femininity but feel a need a more masculine partner. Romantically, I guess, I'd prefer to be treated more as the feminine one in a relationship. I don't really have natural effeminate characteristics, but in some ways I feel much more effeminate than masculine, and would almost prefer to have more effeminate characteristics than I do. My gender hasn't really been something I've thought about much until recently, it has never directly conflicted with my life in a way that I was conscious of until possibly now. My question: does it make sense to identify as male, but not really as a man? I'm not sure if these feelings that I'm describing actually make me a genderqueer individual, or if I'm just sounding like a confused person. My apologies if this comes across as rude. I have done a lot of reading, and I'm just not sure. Although the idea is liberating in a way I hadn't really felt before.

I'm not sure if that's normal, or if it's a sign that I'm genderqueer.\nThe other thing is that I also don't like being the man in any sort of relationship, although I'm straight, I prefer my partner to be the more masculine one. This is especially confusing because I'm attracted to femininity but feel a need a more masculine partner. Romantically, I guess, I'd prefer to be treated more as the feminine one in a relationship. I don't really have natural effeminate characteristics, but in some ways I feel much more effeminate than masculine, and would almost prefer to have more effeminate characteristics than I do. My gender hasn't really been something I've thought about much until recently, it has never directly conflicted with my life in a way that I was conscious of until possibly now. My question: does it make sense to identify as male, but not really as a man? I'm not sure if these feelings that I'm describing actually make me a genderqueer individual, or if I'm just sounding like a confused person. My apologies if this comes across as rude. I have done a lot of reading, and I'm just not sure. Although the idea is liberating in a way I hadn't really felt before.

22,2016-09-17 16:40:41,537yun,2,3,"I have recently taken to thinking of gender presentation as a form of a mask. To me, man, woman, cis, trans, genderfluid, genderqueer, or non-binary (or whatever other labels come up), are all a mask.

For me, I've tried having a more masculine mask in life. I can be interested enough in sports to have a decent time at a Super Bowl party or hanging out with friends watching a baseball game or a football game or something. I just don't feel like, when it comes to what most people think of when they think ""man"" I fit into that. I've tried to be more like that, and it makes unhappy.

Now, as for a feminine mask, I have certain physical attributes that make a feminine presentation a little hard to obtain. My hairline is very male. My face is kinda male. My body, despite some feminine leanings, is that of a guy's. I've made peace with this though.

What I talk about when I say I like the idea of having a feminine mask, it isn't the same as wanting to be a woman. Yes, there are times I want to be a woman, but they aren't as frequent as the times I feel like neither a man or a woman. I do like the flexibility aspect, however.

Not saying they don't catch crap, but women can typically express greater fluidity in their appearance and still be seen as ""normal women."" This is what I talk about when I say I have a more feminine identity, since I feel like femininity has a greater range of expression potential than masculinity, as femininity can borrow from masculinity a lot easier than the other way around.

I am finally getting to a point where I am feeling like I need to express myself more. It isn't a matter of necessarily ""finding myself,"" but that's a part of it. No, this is me saying ""I have always liked this stuff, I am just now allowing myself to actually express a like of it.""

Of course, coming from a conservative family, I was quickly reprehended. 

Because when you're a child your gender doesn't influence all that much, I didn't think about or felt wrong, except on specific cases. Anyway, that was until I was around twelve. Since I was eleven I watched porn and masturbated, you could say I started early. Then, when I was around twelve I realized a think about how I felt sometimes watching porn. I did felt attraction for the male and specially his penis, and that was really confusing back then. For months I wouldn't let myself enjoy that out of guilt that a stupid society and religion had made me feel. Anyway, I tried watching gay porn to see if I would enjoy that, and I found out I didn't.

I just moved cross country, from the midwest to basically the desert, and suddenly this has become a problem. Before I moved, I had a sizeable wardrobe that ranged from very traditionally feminine dresses to normal jeans and t shirts. On the days that I'd feel much more comfortable dressed masculine (at least not feminine), I'd wear jeans and a baggy sweatshirt in order to hide my sizeable chest.

I just wore what I felt best represented what I was feeling that day.
