Yesterday, I fell for a girl at my school. I could only observe her from a distance, and as she smiled, something just clicked.

When I have girl crushes, my imagination gets sexual quite quickly, and with this girl, I feel the need to be a cisgender man and not the transgender person that I have been fighting for. This weirds me out because I now feel as though all the work I put into discovering my gender identity is gone with the wind once I'm kind of 'back in my proper role' (&lt;- read manly man). I wanna sleep with my crush, give them a proper fucking, generally just be 'the man they need' (how sexist is that?!).

Dysphoria becomes unimportant. The features I hated about my appearance are all of a sudden feeling appropriate. I tell myself I should actually rejoice because the burden of being trans is seemingly only related to me feeling as though I'd 'failed as a man'. But it only makes me more unhappy. I can no longer trust my own judgements. The reasons that make me want to identify as trans seem like a fraud, I become disconnected from myself.

I'm (currently) a 24-year-old man with a wife and a 6-month-old son. I've fantasized about being a woman since junior high, but I've had little opportunity to indulge my fantasies, growing up in a conservative Christian household (I'm now Pagan). My wife knows, and she's bi, but I'm pretty sure she would have a hard time if I chose to go consistently feminine even part-time. I'm also concerned about the impact on my son if I switch around or fully transition. Obviously, there's potential for discrimination, loss of friends and family, and issues with work in store for me too (currently unemployed).

To make matters more difficult, I've got a bass voice, stick-like figure, masculine arms and legs, and a desire to keep my original sex organs. I'm not even sure if I want to grow my hair out and/or shave my limbs, because I don't know how much of the time I want to be which gender. I have a wig and makeup, plus some clothes, but I rarely get to use any of it. I regret to admit that the vast majority of trans women disgust me--including myself--because I've got a really high bar for ""passing""... which I feel terrible about. I know a few other trans people, but it always seems like they have an easier time than me. Cis women are worse; I get turned on *and* jealous. In any case, I can't help but find my original self, as a man, ugly.

Without stepping into the mind-fuck that is social constructs, or the fact that this sentiment (X makes you gay) already has homophobic underpinnings that shouldn't be there in the first place, the opinion of men on trans-girls has a huge impact on (straight/pan/bi/+) trans-women's dating lives.

I can help you to feminize your voice.

- I am using my own methodology which is based on approach that is personal. 
  It means that I do not stick to one method with everybody, but rather try to figure out what works for you personally.

- I am sure that anybody can feminize their voice.
  Depending on skill and diligence the process can take from month to half a year.

- And it is affordable.
  Any other voice feminization tutor will charge you twice as much. And will try for as long as he can - to keep you paying.

I ask for 11$ per lesson. One lesson lasts for 45 minutes. The best schedule is three lessons per week, but we can arrange any routine that suits you best.

First lesson is free and you pay only after the lessons.

I am available from 8am till 8pm UTC+0.

Currently I live with my parents, but am planning on moving out in August of this year.

A little background:
My parents have always expressed their dissatisfaction towards homosexuality through their heavily Catholic views.
I don't think my parents understand the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation.
Regardless, I identify as transgender and pansexual (which my parents will more than likely just think of me as a homosexual abomination).
When I was younger, they often questioned me about being gay and told me they would get me ""help"" if I needed it, I.e. Send me to some sort Catholic retreat/school or whatever.

Of course I always too afraid to tell them how I really inside.

I'm a 23 years old now and would like to my live my life how I want for once.
How should I approach my parents about being transgender?
Or should I just wait until I move out?

56,2016-02-24 21:22:17,47f0ku,24,10,"Hey, all, 21F here. 
All my life I've been pretty tomboyish as far as hobbies (wrestling and baseball with brothers as a kid, archery,) go, and then in high school I would rather build set pieces than spend my summer at girl friends' houses or swimming or wherever. Dressing up for dances or ceremonies was always awkward because I think suits look more appealing than dresses, which always make me feel self conscious. 

At one point in high school I believe I had depression and developed anxiety issues. I still have the anxiety, but the depression-like feelings went away when I felt better about myself. When I lost a lot of weight (not being hungry, only eating Ramen, and always being busy helped) and gained noticeable biceps from doing technical theater I felt great. 

Now that I'm older and out of my religious mother's house, I've been able to buy men's clothes and it feels so good to wear baggy cargo pants or a v-neck, even though my bosom is DD in size. I'm still okay with dressing more feminine (like jean styles or cute cardigans), but really dislike my body image in girly clothes, identifying as more of a frumpy mom stylistically. Often when I look in the mirror, I try to stand in such a way that hides my generous chest, or just ignore my chest and look at the rest of me, determining whether I am passable or wondering how I would look as a male. 

For the last two years I've kept my hair short or shaved on at least one side and I liked that contrast for a while; it reflected how I feel. Last night though, I shaved all of it down to the same length again and came to a conclusion I've had before- 

This isn't the first time I knew I looked like a boy (due to my hair). I don't mind being mistaken for one; it's kind of exciting.  Looking in the mirror though, I do have a cute fem face. I like my face. It's not that I'm disappointed exactly, but I can't stop wondering how I would feel about myself if I were male with the broader jawline and more pronounced, hardened features.

I have recently been far more outwardly expressive of the genderqueerness I've felt since somewhere around puberty (before that I never really thought about it too actively, and was outwardly a girl that wore a lot of baggy sweatshirts/jeans/monochrome sneakers), and have been actively considering the complexities of desire/attraction more. I was wondering if anyone could comment on whatever it is that I'm experiencing:

(Also, sorry if I'm using any terminology incorrectly--I'm still trying to figure out how to talk about gender without sounding like an ass and am frequently confused about terms)

A bit of history: I had only identified as bisexual since late middle school until recently just going for [gender]queer.  I also recently realized that I lost my virginity to a woman (the co-captain of my HS varsity wrestling team--she was quite androgynous and muscular as hell), as my hymen didn't rip and in cis/hetero terms PIV sex + tearing is a standard definition. I was in general attracted to men and women, though almost exclusively androgynous women. I confused myself in college and afterwards by dating lots of super femme women, and wondered why the spark frequently wasn't there, though some I dated a bit longer including a queer couple. (the gender of same-sex dates is also a new revelation). The rest of my dates and partners have been cis men, but usually on the less butch side of things--long hair, smooth, pale skin, lanky, or if more stereotypically male-bodied, very comfortable in a dress or just more androgynous personalities. I am not attracted to manly man personalities and do not suffer bros.  

That being said, much of my attraction to men as an adult has stemmed from the perspective of gay male attraction--the books I read in HS and later including porn and a TON of Jean Genet, who is the ultimate, in my opinion, in describing gay attraction. I love the gay leather scene, the concept of rough trade, Tom of Finland, wrestling, jock straps, etc. and consider this type of attraction separate from the perspective of cis female attraction to men. Part of me also retains the latter perspective. On the other hand, the kinds of women I'm attracted to as a woman are different than the kinds of women I'm attracted to when I envision myself as a cis male. ON TOP of all the binary stuff, I'm also just into humans that are a mixture of everything or something entirely different, *especially* if they've got a mix of expression going on to satisfy more of the things that make me tick. 

So the question being, does anyone else feel like they experience a range of gender-gender attraction? What does it mean to you?

But I\'m not sure if it\'s just because of the communities where I don\'t feel comfortable being seen as male (the more popular/male dominated subs on Reddit for example) or if I\'m averse to the pronoun entirely.

1) Bathrooms: These are rather dumb. For one, if there is a long line for one bathroom and a short one for the opposite then it's inefficient to waste energy like that. And if people say ""It's to prevent sexual assault!"", do you think a rapist cares which bathroom they go into?

2) Locker Rooms: [Stereotype Threat!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat) If a female student is reminded of their gender before PE, they're likely to perform worse. And if you're worried about Male on Female viewing then you must be forgetting Kinsey's 10% model. So there is no way to keep people from being attracted to each other.

3) Sports/Military/Police: Now I know that on average Biological Male's are stronger. However, there are men as weak as the average women and women as strong as the average man. Instead of sex segregation, I propose... Strength Segregation! Sure on average, more Males will be on Team A but some strong females can compete with people on their level, and weak males will be able to compete! As for police and military allow females into every core as long as they meet standards. 

4) Dormitory/Housing: Certain housing or dormitories are not co-ed. This is RIDICULOUS! They do it to avoid people have sex. Do they not know what gay people are? Similar to locker rooms, there is no way to stop people from being attracted to each other.

If I left something out tell me!

My name is Joe, I'm AFAB and I usually frequent the FTM sub because I have been living as male for almost a year now and am very close to getting on T.

I just have a few nagging doubts that I wanted to share with you guys to see if anybody here feels similarly.
I'm 23 now, but throughout my entire life I have had a really big issue with basically stealing people's identities. Not in the illegal sense, just in a subconscious ""I don't feel like a real person, I don't have my own identity so let me see who I admire so I can emulate them""
It really affects my life, because I am forever changing. I don't think people notice very much because I'm quite reserved anyway, but if they did I'd be a bit embarrassed. I feel ashamed of doing this and I want to stop and find my own identity, but I don't know how. When I was living as female, I would choose either female or male personas and just attempt to embody someone from YouTube, a movie, a book etc. It was kind of a situation where I would feel temporary relief because I felt like I could latch onto something, like I was a real person but it would always wear off because it obviously wasn't actually me and I'd become sad again. I couldn't stop though, because I felt like I didn't know what else to do. When you don't know who you are, who do you be? So I just keep going and going, moving on to the next thing. 
Just for some context, some of the people I remember trying to emulate were HeyBrittany and Koi Fresco from YouTube. It's pretty embarrassing to admit, but I really want to see if there are other people out there who do this too. It's a never-ending, sad cycle that really gets me down. I just latch onto a concept or a persona and it makes me feel relief, kind of like if you're quitting smoking but then you just have one and it feels good but afterwards you feel like a failure, you know?
I'm not proud of this, I just don't know how to stop. I feel very afraid that even once I get on T, I'll just restart the cycle - that it won't let up. On the other hand, maybe the reason that I don't feel like I have my own identity is because I'm supposed to be male but I can't express that so I just flit from one thing to the next, feeling empty every time? 
It's all just a tangle of thorns.

Long-time lurker. In my quest to figure out my own non-binary gender identity and sexuality, I wanted a way to describe who I was and who I was attracted to. 


I made a web tool which allows you to show your gender identity in a code like this: G3-828690-8329XX

Others can look at this code to see your gender identity and presentation, and how you were assigned at birth (if you want to include this information). You can also show what gender identity you are attracted to. 

Drag a few sliders to match your gender identity and attraction, and out comes the code. I put mine in my Twitter bio.

Try it here: 

https://gendercode.netlify.com/

It's loosely based on version 3 of the [Genderbread person](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2015/03/the-genderbread-person-v3/).

---

I'd love to get some feedback. Does it work for you?
I'm especially interested from feedback from genderfluid and asexual people, and whether it works for you, too.

More recently I'm pretty much alright with them, I'm not sure if that's a permanent state of mind or not. I'm not sure if I have genital dysphoria or not? It's not like I dislike having a vagina, but if I were putting my body together I might have chosen another set of genitals. But overall it doesn't matter to me that much; it's there and it's not causing me trouble. 

One thing that I always hated about my anatomy though is the fact that I menstruate. I've always had extremely painful and irregular periods and had to go on birth control to help them. Even now though when I get my period I just feel disgusted and angry that I have to bleed every month. I'm also really averse to pregnancy? I wouldn't call it a full-on phobia but the idea of being pregnant and sometimes seeing pregnant people makes me feel really gross and uncomfortable. Not to mention it is very feminized and it honestly disgusts me to imagine being pregnant and everyone thinking I'm a woman and a mother. So I'm not sure if dysphoria can apply to bodily functions and if that is something I might have? 

Finally, I was wondering what kind of options afab people have for being more physically androgynous.

So far everything is nice and easy lol
BUT

I wear mostly men's shirts and have short hair. I like it when I look like a boy and calling me using masculine pronouns strokes my ego and confirms my skill in choosing the right clothing. I don't do it for fun, it's not my ""stage persona"" or an alter ego. This is who I am. I just really enjoy going outside wearing a ""manly"" outfit. I feel like some badass boy.

I look bad in long hair and I don't feel comfortable in typical ""feminine"" clothes.
On the other hand I bought a pair of sturdy-ish heels and I can imagine wearing them with a man's suit jacket. And some pants of course lol

But I'm a straight girl. 
People gossip behind my back that I'm lesbian. My ex-boyfriend tried to subtly manipulate me to become a ""standard issue girly-girl"". 
This leads to me seriously worrying that I will never find a man. Maybe I think this way because my previous relationship left my self-esteem in tatters.
Ironically, I think that at the current stage, it would be easier for me to find a boyfriend if I changed sex lol

Again, I do feel good in my female body, I do not do anything to alter the shape of it.

I did some research, but I'm yet to find a piece of information to answer my questions. 

I tried imagining being addressed using different pronouns, but honestly all of them sound just... odd? The occasional ""he"" is ok, but I don't think I could take it all the time. And I'm used to ""she"" as that's what I've heard my whole life, but I feel like it's pushing me to be girly.
""They"" and all the other genderless pronouns make me feel weird.

Who am I?

I am writing here because I am finally coming to terms with the fact that I am not 100 percent straight. If I were to ""define"" my sexuality, I believe the term that best describes my feelings would be ""pansexual"". However, at this point in my life I perhaps would rather label myself as something like ""genderfluid"" until I figure it all out. All I know is that the ""straight"" label is definitely not at all an accurate representation of my sexuality.

I have had my parents come to me multiple times to inquire if I was gay based on my tastes in very androgynous men. The idea of being accused as gay was a terrifying prospect for me. I didn't want that burden. I was embarassed. I felt like being gay would be letting my parents down, namely my adoring mother who loved pressing me to talk boys and fashion with her and always idealized me as her perfect little girl.

Last semester at my college I met a wonderful girl who happened to be my professor - meeting her led me to the realization that I am in fact not completely straight.

I have yet to actually experiment with a woman, but it is something I definitely want to try.

My parents are very open-minded people, and the times they approached me about my sexuality in the past they were very cool about it. However, now that I have begun to realize my true sexual identity and really want to discuss it with my mother, I don't think they have the same attitudes towards homosexuality anymore.

I have tried to bring up the topic of my sexuality multiple times recently with my mother - hinting/joking that I might be interested in women, asking her how she would feel if I were interested in women. Her response? ""You're crazy - you talk about guys too much. You're not gay.""

*YES* - I *do* prefer men the majority of the time. But my feelings towards certain women are completely valid. They exist. Sexuality is not black and white, there are so many gray areas, and this is what I believe my mother does not understand (or at least wish to acknowledge.)

It makes me sad because this is a subject truly important to me. My mother and I are extremely close and I want to discuss these matters with her, but I don't feel that I can.

73,2016-02-14 00:01:12,45niaw,39,3,"Hey there,
I’ve got some thingy’s I have questions about, or wonder if people have the same issues.
Some info about me first:

* AMAB

* 25

* Crossdressing

* Probably genderfluid (I never really feel 100% male) 

* Sometimes I think I have some form of dysphoria, feeling trapped not being able to wear and buy feminine clothes in public.

* Feminine build body (Cancer treatment messed up my hormones for a bit, for example: still don’t have facial hair)

Now the issues:

* I seem to switch back to wanting to present masculine whenever I’m involved with dating or when I fancy someone with female gender. And most of the time I nope the fuck out of the 
whole ‘genderfluid’ thing as if it was never there (even though I know it will come back later).

* This stops me from being able to come out as genderfluid to my best friend. Long story short: we dated in our teens, friendzoned now, still have some leftover feelings for her. And because of that I switch back to guy mode.

* Sometimes I wonder if I focus on these gender-issues and crossdressing to get away from the other bad stuff that’s going on in my life.

* Also a lot of time my girl mode seems to be triggered by external factors, mostly clothing shopping (not being able to go to the womens section) and sometimes because I saw something genderqueer related on tumbler.

* I never had the ‘I’ve known it since childhood’ experience. I’ve only been questioning for about some years now. (I’ve always had an equal number of male and female friends)

I’m a bit at a loss, I feel really awkward about myself when I nope the fuck back to guy-mode. And at other times I really want to be able to dicuss things with my bestie, showing her the cute clothes 
I bought, etc. When I’m in male mode I’m really afraid I’m faking the other side of me, starting to question a lot about the sincerety of my feelings. 

I also am just not sure whether it’s genderfluidness, crossdressing desires or just me being an escapist. 

Also I’m wondering if the fact that I appearently don’t have enough male-hormones is making feel the way I feel. So does the lack of your asigned birth sex hormones make you feel genderqueer? 

I hope some people here might be able to give me some insight. 


Thanks for reading my wall of text :)

I know no one can tell you if you're trans or not. I just know that I spend a lot of time reading websites, going on forums like this, talking to people and just having way too much anxiety about my gender identity.  

I remember the first person I came out to and the only significant one that  I'm still only really out to is my partner. s/he said that sometimes they are a boy and sometimes that they are a girl. And I said to them that I didn't want to be a boy or a girl. I still feel that way I don't really want to be a boy or girl.  Back before then I just used to introduce myself to people just as a person. Which was half jokingly. I didn't even know this was a thing at the time. I mean I guess I don't want to be seen as a man or woman. I just want to be a person. But,then people ask ""Okay what does that mean""  What does it mean to  be a man or woman? And I just don't know.

86,2016-02-16 13:59:13,462jow,9,15,"Hey,

I'm having a big crisis right now and I feel alone and scared.

I've been wrestling with gender ID for about 4 years now. I'm 23, but when I was 19 I had one of those ""epiphany"" moments -- started binge-watching trans guy videos, lurking on forums, you know the drill. I became really obsessed with learning as much as I could, because it felt like it could be a way out of my confusion. I got really scared though and after about 3 months I just flipped out and went back to being even more femme than I ever had before, just ditched all of my LGBT friends, broke up with my girlfriend and ran away back into conventionality. Got myself a boyfriend, started wearing earrings and painting my nails, basically pretending to be a regular girl. It got me a lot of perks, people received me very well. Being someone who has never fit in anywhere and has always felt like an outcast, this really made me feel good. People thought I was beautiful, all the boys wanted to be with me and the girls wanted to be friends with me. It felt great. But when I was alone, I would crossdress and lurk on forums and watch the videos -- just generally confusing myself.

Now I'm back to living as male and I have been doing so for about a year. For the most part, I feel good but there are a couple of serious nagging doubts that crop into my head every few days. I just don't feel like either. I'm very afraid of being seen as a man, because the reality is not going to be like my fantasy all those years ago when I was crossdressing by myself. People aren't just going to immediately accept me and love me -- I'm going to be an outcast again and I'm really afraid of that. I don't know the practicalities of being a man and I'm a socially anxious person. I can barely make phone calls and when I talk to people in regular situations, I just fumble like a fool. I hold on to the emotions for a long time if I mess up and I feel unable to do a lot of social things. It really upsets me if I mess up or do something dumb, it makes me feel very low and sad and worthless. I feel like I get away with it so much being seen as female. It's cute, it's adorable, people overlook it. If my boyfriend acted like I do, everyone would think he was mad. He couldn't just nod and shake his head at people in public when they talk to him. He wouldn't be able to look at the floor and avoid eye contact and stare at his feet when someone asks him a question. Nobody would accept that, and I feel like that's what's going to change for me when I get on T. 
I don't know how accurate that is, having never been on T before but I'm just imagining the worst basically. 

My other major road block is my warped view of ageing. I am very very afraid of being an ""old man"". I think this comes from the fact that I have been badly affected by bullying, all centred around my appearance. Up until the age of 13, I was a tomboy. I didn't give two hoots about my appearance. I thought it was a stupid thing to worry about and I hated wearing dresses. It was okay until around age 11, but after that people started noticing that I wasn't developing into a nice young lady. Teachers and school peers really disliked me for that. I went to an all-girl private school and the atmosphere of those is always a little reality-warped. The teachers were all over everybody being ""lovely, respectable young ladies"" -- basically wanted everyone to be exactly the same. They used to pick on me and hassle me every day. They genuinely disliked me, would always tell me to shut up and if I tried to put my hand up or say anything, it would always be like ""put your hand down, you don't know anything."" It was a bit extreme -- private girls school in England, sharing a classroom with rich posh girls called Henrietta and Eleanor lol. I felt like a freak. The kids didn't like me either. 
I altered myself therefore, and I became a girl. It was fun and I genuinely enjoyed it and I loved not being bullied. I stayed this way for 10 years.
Anyway, back to the original point: because of these experiences, I am deathly afraid of being ""unattractive"". The way my appearance was constantly scrutinised really did traumatise me. So the idea of going from similar to this: http://www.freestockphotos.biz/stockphoto/11823
(not me, obviously)
To at some point in the future this: http://www.aukevo.com/old-man-3d-character-design/
(picked a character because I didn't want to pick on some old guy!)

Is just too much for me. Like, I can't fathom it. It's horrifying to me. I'm very very afraid of ageing as a man.

I don't know exactly how this all came across, I'm sorry if I sound like a total dick. Really, I'm not. I'm just really scared and confused. 
When I'm a woman, I feel empty and identityless. When I present as male, I feel confident and happy but looking into the future is just the scariest thing. I'm happy to be a young attractive guy (or even just a young, mediocre-looking guy) but ageing as a man is something I can't seem to come to terms with.

What is this? I feel like a crazy person. 
Does anyone have any similar feelings? I know I just kind of rambled on and I probably didn't make much sense and I'm genuinely sorry if I came across as a jerk, but I'm really close to getting on T and I don't know how to unravel what I'm feeling. I'm scared :(

This is not only a huge invasion of privacy, but an extremely damaging bill to the trans, nonbiniary, and intersex community. This post is calling for all of you who agree that this bill should be vetoed to contact Daugaard and let your voices be heard. ""We are visible and vast in number!""

Governor Dennis Daugaard contact info:

Phone: (605) 773-3212

Mailing: Office of the governor

Essentially, I am seeking advice as to how to move past the fear of transition, motivated by internalized racism and transphobia. Some background:

I'm 18. For a few years now, I've been wanting to start a low dose of T in order to ""masculinize"" my features somewhat, gain a deeper voice and muscle mass — I identify as bigender, not solely male, but I experience dysphoria (especially regarding my voice) and, in addition to alleviating that, would also like to be able to present as more convincingly male (when I want to do so). Inhabiting a physical ""midway point"" would be ideal — thus, I may stop T at some point later on.

I've been extremely hesitant, though. For a while I thought the hesitance was a sign that I wasn't really ""meant"" to go through with it, and I tried to put thoughts of hormonal transition out of my head; but I can't stop thinking about it more and more now. I've come to the recent realization that my fear and hesitance actually has a lot to do with internalized racism.

I'm Indian, and the way I see it, that's already a strike against me in terms of desirability, at least in the West. But right now, I do have the capacity to be conventionally feminine. And no matter how uncomfortable it can make me to be so, it's still a strange comfort to know that I can make at least some people find me attractive by wearing a push-up bra and a dress. When I lose that ability to an extent, who's going to find me attractive then? There's something that people seem to find so inherently undesirable about Indian men, at least in my experience, and the idea of inhabiting a gender-nonconforming, transmasculine, Indian identity is frightening to me because it renders me so ""other"" and so unattractive.

I want to be able to form romantic and sexual relationships with others. I'm more worried about men than women. I'm bisexual, and would like to have the potential to form connections with men/women/other nonbinary people equally. But how am I going to find any of that, being the way that I am?

How do I move past being disgusted by both my own gender nonconformity and my own Indianness in order to seek out the treatment I want in order to feel better inside of my body?

The issue is really convoluted for me and I wish it wasn't. I'm afraid of losing things like sexual function and afraid of how people will react to my changes. And as much as I find myself wanting some measure of chest these days I'm afraid that going back on Estrogen will just result in me wigging out again when they start growing. 

For now I think I'm gonna try and power through it and see if I can have some measure of stability where I am.

152,2016-02-27 21:37:29,47y78s,3,6,"I remember when I first started to develop breasts, I wanted to chop them off. I remember hopping that they would at least be small and flat like my yoga teacher's chest. I remember being 12 (right when puberty hit for me) and often times crying myself to sleep listening to jazz and feeling like the specialist little snowflake, because I wasn't even sure why I was sad or felt empty. There was just a huge lump in my throat that made me want to cry. Since the beginning of puberty I was teased about being a lesbian, which I denied (even though I voiced my thinking that being penetrated sounded awful and that I'd rather be with a girl). Through middle school and high school I did my best to conform. later on I even wished my boobs would get bigger so I could be like other girls. High school me was always trying to fit in. In grade 12 my group of friends did 'Guy Day Friday' (someone else in the group came up with it) I just thought it was fun and put my long hair up in a beanie and wore button ups when I did join in. 

However, flash forward to first year uni and doing full on drag with a bunch of friends at my place. Im talking drawn on beard, boxers and even (my friends gave me the idea) stuffing socks in the crotch. At the end of the night when everyone left I looked at myself in the mirror and felt turned on by my reflection for the first time. This was before I had even acknowledged that I wasn't straight. Navigating my sexuality has been difficult as I have a low libido and am *very* rarely attracted to people sexually. I don't fantasize about other people either. Lately however, if I need to relieve stress the only way I can get turned on is if I think of myself as being male below the waist the whole time. I have heard that some lesbians think of themselves as having male parts to better enjoy sex with a partner if they are dominant (a post from /r/actuallesbians) I do this too even if I'm not using equipment. And now that I'm back out in the dating world I sometimes think of this male player persona to inspire me to be more confident and relaxed when it comes to even just talking to cute people. Dating men and having to deal with heteronormativity has never worked for me even when dating guys with more liberal viewpoints who identified themselves as feminists. But I see beauty in both genders, especially when the two are combined in an individual its just wow.

Somedays I hate my breasts and some days I like having them. I wear makeup most days and love wearing comfy dresses. Somedays I love dressing like a boy, other days I dress in between and sometimes I dress femme. For the most part I hate bras and sleep topless. I love showing off my small feminine waist and feel positive about my highly feminine facial features. I always try to see 'male' and 'female' features in my body when I am unclothed to feel balanced i.e. my hairy legs and muscle definition. A  lot of the time I feel like my natural personality leans more towards what is considered male thinking, and that the feminine aspects of my personality for the most part, I have developed through social conditioning. 

I have struggled with repression from an early age and have been actively working to express my feelings for almost a year now. It can be hard for me to tell when I really like something at times, because I get so much out of pleasing other people. I've talked about not identifying as any gender with close friends and they have been really positive about it even asking me what pronouns I'd like. Thing is I feel fine with male, female or gender neutral pronouns, as it isn't a big deal to me at this point (my own pronouns, I respect others' pronouns). I've always sort of felt that gender was a pretty arbitrary aspect of a person. 
One time I was on the phone with my mum ranting about misogyny and some other stuff and I talked about feeling different from other girls and saying how I didn't feel like a girl or a boy. My mother told me I was a girl and that I shouldn't get caught up in what was 'a trendy topic in the queer community right now' and that I wasn't legitimately agender like other people. She made me feel like acknowledging that I didn't feel female or male was just being a feminist who recognized that in a perfect world gender wouldn't matter and that it doesn't influence your true self. We don't live in the same city right now and when I visit home I dress a lot more femme and just generally try to be a bit more heteronormative so idk and also her friends that are lesbians are a lot more 'butch' so idk maybe that's what she was trying to tell me is that maybe i'm just butch. I haven't brought it up since.

I feel confused a lot about gender. Am I just a girl who happens to identify with some 'masculine traits'? or am I gender fluid? Or am I a girl who doesn't care about conforming to any ideas of gender. I've been back and forth between identifying as female and genderless. Getting my period makes me feel like a total girl lately and I really hate that feeling. None of the labels feel quite right, I am just me. The only label I've ever really warmed up to is queer, but just queer on its own. I watch a lot of youtube videos documenting FTM transitions and videos of those guys talking about gender and what not. I have figured out that I am definitely not male. I've watched some videos of genderqueer youtubers talking about gender and stuff, but the only person's words who have really hit me hard was IO Tillett Wright. They talked about not really being dysphoric about their body, but at the same time feeling like a man at the end of the day.

Sometimes I can go long periods without thinking about my gender at all, but other times (like now) it feels like its all I can think about. **How do I know where my ideals around gender end and my actual gender begins?** Is there a way I can temporarily disentangle the two trains of thought so I can just you know figure it out and be able to move forward.

I am still learning a lot about gender (obviously) so let me know if I expressed anything in a way that was offensive as I don't want to offend anyone.
",genderqueer,I don't think I am totally cis... but maybe I am?,1456634249.0,"{'created_utc': 1456609049, 'id': '47y78s', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 6, 'selftext': ""I remember when I first started to develop breasts, I wanted to chop them off. I remember hopping that they would at least be small and flat like my yoga teacher's chest. I remember being 12 (right when puberty hit for me) and often times crying myself to sleep listening to jazz and feeling like the specialist little snowflake, because I wasn't even sure why I was sad or felt empty. There was just a huge lump in my throat that made me want to cry. Since the beginning of puberty I was teased about being a lesbian, which I denied (even though I voiced my thinking that being penetrated sounded awful and that I'd rather be with a girl). Through middle school and high school I did my best to conform. later on I even wished my boobs would get bigger so I could be like other girls. High school me was always trying to fit in. In grade 12 my group of friends did 'Guy Day Friday' (someone else in the group came up with it) I just thought it was fun and put my long hair up in a beanie and wore button ups when I did join in. \n\nHowever, flash forward to first year uni and doing full on drag with a bunch of friends at my place. Im talking drawn on beard, boxers and even (my friends gave me the idea) stuffing socks in the crotch. At the end of the night when everyone left I looked at myself in the mirror and felt turned on by my reflection for the first time. This was before I had even acknowledged that I wasn't straight. Navigating my sexuality has been difficult as I have a low libido and am *very* rarely attracted to people sexually. I don't fantasize about other people either. Lately however, if I need to relieve stress the only way I can get turned on is if I think of myself as being male below the waist the whole time. I have heard that some lesbians think of themselves as having male parts to better enjoy sex with a partner if they are dominant (a post from /r/actuallesbians) I do this too even if I'm not using equipment. And now that I'm back out in the dating world I sometimes think of this male player persona to inspire me to be more confident and relaxed when it comes to even just talking to cute people. Dating men and having to deal with heteronormativity has never worked for me even when dating guys with more liberal viewpoints who identified themselves as feminists. But I see beauty in both genders, especially when the two are combined in an individual its just wow.\n\nSomedays I hate my breasts and some days I like having them. I wear makeup most days and love wearing comfy dresses. Somedays I love dressing like a boy, other days I dress in between and sometimes I dress femme. For the most part I hate bras and sleep topless. I love showing off my small feminine waist and feel positive about my highly feminine facial features. I always try to see 'male' and 'female' features in my body when I am unclothed to feel balanced i.e. my hairy legs and muscle definition. A  lot of the time I feel like my natural personality leans more towards what is considered male thinking, and that the feminine aspects of my personality for the most part, I have developed through social conditioning. \n\nI have struggled with repression from an early age and have been actively working to express my feelings for almost a year now. It can be hard for me to tell when I really like something at times, because I get so much out of pleasing other people. I've talked about not identifying as any gender with close friends and they have been really positive about it even asking me what pronouns I'd like. Thing is I feel fine with male, female or gender neutral pronouns, as it isn't a big deal to me at this point (my own pronouns, I respect others' pronouns). I've always sort of felt that gender was a pretty arbitrary aspect of a person. \nOne time I was on the phone with my mum ranting about misogyny and some other stuff and I talked about feeling different from other girls and saying how I didn't feel like a girl or a boy. My mother told me I was a girl and that I shouldn't get caught up in what was 'a trendy topic in the queer community right now' and that I wasn't legitimately agender like other people. She made me feel like acknowledging that I didn't feel female or male was just being a feminist who recognized that in a perfect world gender wouldn't matter and that it doesn't influence your true self. We don't live in the same city right now and when I visit home I dress a lot more femme and just generally try to be a bit more heteronormative so idk and also her friends that are lesbians are a lot more 'butch' so idk maybe that's what she was trying to tell me is that maybe i'm just butch. I haven't brought it up since.\n\nI feel confused a lot about gender. Am I just a girl who happens to identify with some 'masculine traits'? or am I gender fluid? Or am I a girl who doesn't care about conforming to any ideas of gender. I've been back and forth between identifying as female and genderless. Getting my period makes me feel like a total girl lately and I really hate that feeling. None of the labels feel quite right, I am just me. The only label I've ever really warmed up to is queer, but just queer on its own. I watch a lot of youtube videos documenting FTM transitions and videos of those guys talking about gender and what not. I have figured out that I am definitely not male. I've watched some videos of genderqueer youtubers talking about gender and stuff, but the only person's words who have really hit me hard was IO Tillett Wright. They talked about not really being dysphoric about their body, but at the same time feeling like a man at the end of the day.\n\nSometimes I can go long periods without thinking about my gender at all, but other times (like now) it feels like its all I can think about. **How do I know where my ideals around gender end and my actual gender begins?** Is there a way I can temporarily disentangle the two trains of thought so I can just you know figure it out and be able to move forward.\n\nI am still learning a lot about gender (obviously) so let me know if I expressed anything in a way that was offensive as I don't want to offend anyone.\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I don't think I am totally cis... but maybe I am?"", 'created': 1456634249.0}"

I am a trans guy and am currently writing my undergrad thesis in psychology at York University in Toronto, Canada. I think it's important for research about the trans/non-cisgender community to be done by trans people so I chose the focus of my thesis to be on the resiliencies of trans and genderqueer folks. I want to make sure I include the full spectrum of non-cisgender identities in my research which is why I am posting this study here. Psychology sometimes still has a long way to go in including non-cisgender individuals in research and care so I'm hoping my small study can help things along. 

I would be happy to answer any additional questions here, or the first page of the study gives my supervisor's contact info.

17,2016-02-15 13:40:44,45whz3,0,2,"Hi there! I'm an Asian teen, under 20 years old. I've recently moved to Sydney for university. I'm not too sure what else to say about myself, but I'm going to be holding on to this account for a while, and I can just post if I have anything else to say. So I'll just get to the nitty gritty.

ABOUT ME - Mentally

If I'm not wrong, I'm gender dysphoric. I have a fascination for female clothing, sometimes dream of being a girl and not a guy and have tried on heels, which was a long time ago since I've since grown out of my mother's high heels. I've had no wish to change genders, was raised as a boy and identify as a boy. I feel fine as I am.

I'm really afraid to say that I'm only doing this for sexual pleasure because it started off as such, though I can't really remember how it started. I just sort of want it to be something more than that. Masturbation is something that doesn't appeal to me because it just feels wrong, but it's become something of a habit since I discovered it. 

Anyways, recently I found out about androgyny, and I was really motivated by it. (I have a few close friends who I'm afraid might freak out and distance themselves should I come out publicly, only certain close people know about this). I am really into the idea of having someone having to put thought into determining my gender. It also means that I can pass off my antics as being overly stylish. :P

TL;DR, my dream is crossdressing and passing, current goal is 'androgyning' and passing.

ABOUT ME - Physically

I'm rather proud of my slim frame, though it's kind of bony though less so than a while back. It's also rectangular, widening at the shoulder. Height is about average for an Asian teen, 5'10'. I'd like to think that my face looks like something that can be easily made to look like one gender or the other, but that's my judgement and my opinion isn't the opinion of everyone else. It's rather round with a sort of wide jawline, which became inspiration for my username. Trying to grow out my hair, which could make my about-three-head-width shoulders look less. At this point I can only dream of a pixie cut.

I have used hair remover on my legs, which works rather well but never keeps it at bay. Epilation is said to hurt as is waxing, so that option is pretty daunting, not to mention expensive. I'd really not like to spend too much on pampering myself as I brave through uni.

did I mention I hate beard hairs and five o clock shadow ugh 

QUESTIONS

What sounds androgynous? I'd like to train my voice to speak in that manner or maybe even feminine, but I have nothing to relate to. Everything just sounds so high. I'd like some references and tips on how to train my voice, whatever you might know - I've done a bit of research.

Hair removal? What do you (faab&amp;amp;maab) do with your hair, every patch of it?

Some natural method of widening my hips. Exercises, anything.

Clothing styles. Korean fashion and the like is very, very appealing. 

...that's about all I can conjure up. I might put photos on the web but I'm wary of privacy and all.

I realize this is a lot to take in, and this is all for myself. If you're willing to help out, I thank you very, very much in advance.

See you in the comment section!

I don't really consider myself to be genderfluid, but I have had some times in the past where I wasn't really sure.  I know there are plenty of people who wonder if they are trans, or some other identity.  After realizing I was gay, I figured that had been the source of my feelings, and that I just felt more comfortable with androgynous/unisex clothing and appearances (and I do still feel that way).

However, there have been times where I still wondered about being a girl, turning into a girl, etc.  They usually pass fairly quickly, and I don't generally act on them.  Last night, however, I had a rather vivid dream that made me feel somewhat conflicted about the matter.

In short, I was given a ring that, if I wore it, would slowly transform my physical body into that of a woman's.  This entire transformation would take a couple of days, but was painless, and would reverse similarly if I took it off.  I don't remember much, but I recall looking into a mirror at some points and seeing how my figure was changing into that of a woman; chiefly, my face and my torso.  The dream ended shortly after.

Honestly, looking back at what I wrote, this all seems kinda silly, but I can't keep my mind off of it.

36,2016-02-23 13:41:00,476m8p,11,9,"Hello fellow fluid people :)

I'm a 25 AMAB genderfluid person. (Also I'm still trying to get the hang of how to layout posts at reddit, so bare with me)

&amp;nbsp;

For me girl-mode always slowly creeps in on me. Sometimes just because I feel like it, other times when I'n triggered because of something (like for example being at the clothing store, unable to browse the women section).   Then I feel this nagging itch of putting on some girl clothing, if I feel like it works that day (and look like a girl) the gendereuphoria kicks in up to a point that I sometimes think I might better off being a girl. But when the euphoria wears off I immediately revert back to guy-mode.  Like when you thought you were in love with someone, and right after this other person confirms their love for you, you then you start to feel like 'Oh shit, perhaps I'm not really in love after all'. At the end of my cycle (returning back to guy-mode) I feel the same embarrassment. Like 'What the hell was I doing!?"". Still I don't want throw away my girl clothing, I still do not feel fully a like a full 'male'. I still feel fluid. And it confuses the hell out of me. 

&amp;nbsp;

*So basicly my cycle is:* 1.Guy-ish mode  2.(Trigger) 3.Nagging for girly things -&gt; crossdressing 4.Gendereuphoria (like a lovesick puppy) 5.Could it be that I am actually a girl? 6.Noping the fuck out of it feeling embarrassed and all. 

&amp;nbsp;

However even though how unsettling this is, it always worked out since I was the only one knowing it. But in a rush of being in girl-mode for a few days, I came out to my mother and a close friend of mine. My friend (a girl) stayed really cool about it. My mum too, but being the worried type she is, she was like 'If this feeling persist you might wanna see therapist' and 'Couldn't it be you're just transgendered (as referring to the media term).' And for two days after coming out I started to warm up to that idea as wel. But now BOOM out of nowhere, back to boy mode. Sorry mum, I guess I was wrong? 

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: Weird gendercycle, feeling awkward when back to 'boy-mode'. Mum thinks I might be trans.

&amp;nbsp;

edit: I have no idea how to make bulletpoints...

edit 2:
Also might be worth telling that when I feel more like a girl I like to browse the /asktransgender reddit a lot.
