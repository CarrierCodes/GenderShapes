As a kid I never noticed any discomfort with my body or gender. I wanted to be seen as a tomboy (I wasn’t) and hated “girly things” but that was the extent of it. When puberty started I became miserable with my body and that feeling has persisted for the 10-odd years since then. Height, breasts, hips, hand size, legs, all the things about my very feminine proportions that show that I am female make me feel disconnected and weird about my physical form. I’ve never felt much of a desire for a dick but reminders that I have a “hole” make me uncomfortable (penetration terrifies me, I can’t even put in a tampon without my body freaking out) and I am uncomfortable about my reproductive system. I dress in men’s clothes and cut my hair short but I am very rarely seen as male. When this does happen it feels good, probably because it means other people aren’t noticing all the parts of me that I hate.

I don’t have any inner sense of “gender identity” and I never have. I feel very disconnected from the word woman but I don’t have the same issue with the word female, which imo is just a biological term for what I am. When I’ve gone to college counselors (the only therapist-type people I have access to) at first they focus on identity and preferred pronouns, but I never know what to tell them. For me it’s mostly about wanting to get rid of the female features of my body. Some of the effects of testosterone are things that I don’t especially want, and I go back and forth between maybe wanting to try a low dose and not starting at all. I went to a doctor once to discuss testosterone and asked him about low dose T, but he basically scoffed in my face and said he doesn’t do “partial transitions”. I definitely want top surgery but I don’t know if someone like me would be able to get it. 

I’m open to the idea that I’m just a cis female with weird hangups, or the idea that this is somehow related to the autism that my parents have always assumed I have. I can’t relate to any trans narrative that I’ve ever heard, but when I see things about ftm transitions I feel like in some ways the people are like me. For 4-5 years I’ve been considering transition but my thoughts on it fluctuate over time. I worry how I would even explain aspects of  transition like top surgery to other people without the “I was always a boy inside” narrative, and I worry about having to live as a man socially when I don’t think that would be easier for me. At the same time I can’t see myself having a future as a woman. To be honest I just don’t know what to do, and college counselors can’t do much to help me.

Anyway, I'm a non binary MAAB art student who's thinking about creating a NB clothing line, and am looking for a bit of advice and input. I know that there's a few lines out there already, but what I've been seeing so far from places like Selfridges and Zara seems to be a samey and shapeless, tends to be pretty masculine in general and is seems quite expensive/inaccessible to your average person. The vision I've got in my head for this hypothetical line or label would be a bit more vibrant and interesting, form fitting and varied, with the aim of making it accessible to more people. I'd love for it be inclusive to all, and I know that there are also cisgender people out there that would like to have a ungendered option when it comes to shopping for clothes.

Personally in  the past I've found it pretty hard to find clothes that fit me well - I'm on the skinny side and only about 5'7-5'8 so I'm mainly left with the choice of getting something that fits really well from the women's department but might be too much on the feminine side cut or style-wise for me, or getting something with a more neutral cut or style from the men's department but having it hang off my body, so I'd like for it to be size inclusive and body positive for as many people as possible. Obviously there are practicalities to consider in terms of how many sizes of each item would be do-able as a newly started business/social enterprise, but inclusive is what I'd very much be aiming for as the core of the line.

The concept is that these are clothes for people, without boundaries, with the only separation being different kinds of cuts and styles - with the idea that one day anyone could walk into a high street store and shop in the clothes department and not feel left out or unwelcome. Anyway, that's my spiel haha, so I was wondering if anyone's got any thoughts on this idea?

Hey :) I've always thought of myself as a masc cis woman who loves presenting androgyously, but recently I've been thinking that maybe demigirl or another nonbinary identity might suit me better. I've never really felt that ""woman"" fully reflected my gender but I didn't really think I could find anything better and I also don't experience dysphoria generally. Over the course of my relationship with my AMAB girlfriend (yay we're coming close on 3 years), I've become increasingly aware of non-binary identities through my allyship with the trans community but I also feel that my experiences are quite different to many of the people I know well. I am not sure whether I want to change my pronouns because I like both she and they pronouns (currently use she). I like my appearance most when I appear androgynous and dislike my big boobs which are the biggest detracting factor in my opinion from the androgynous look. I like it when my partner calls me her girlfriend but I don't like it when I am gendered female in social situations especially if it comes with the extra baggage of gender roles.

I like my appearance most when I appear androgynous and dislike my big boobs which are the biggest detracting factor in my opinion from the androgynous look.

So, here I am.

Background about me - I've always considered myself a leftist, politically, but never got on board with a lot of the radical social leftism that's been getting some spotlight more recently. So, when my girlfriend came out as bigender, I guess I didn't respond as I should have. I'll just come out and say it - I can't understand how this is anything but a mental illness, and I told her as much. I said, in addition, that that's fine with me, she's got others and this doesn't really make a difference, but she still contends its different from a simple delusion or something of the sort. So I'm asking you to explain what the difference is, here. My understanding of all this follows:


(and please, guys, grant me the benefit of the doubt here. I'm not trolling, I'm not from fucking the_donald or whatever. This is actually what I believe and I just want to see if maybe you guys can explain it better than my girlfriend can and I can better understand what she's saying.)

The way I see it, gender is a useless word. Biological sex exists, and gender is a collection of social norms that are entirely subjective and largely sexist. She says that she ""sometimes feels masculine and sometimes, feminine."" I am completely incapable of understanding this. 

I'm not a super masculine alpha male or something, I guess I do or feel things that'd be ""traditionally feminine"" from time to time. I don't feel particularly masculine OR feminine, I just have a Y chromosome with an active SRY gene and that's it. She was not able to explain why she sometimes feels masculine or feminine, and I think that was the biggest sticking point for me, since even these subjective, completely created gender stereotypes are at least loosely defined, and (I'd imagine) feeling masculine or feminine would mean adhering to these stereotypes in some way, which she says is not an accurate way to describe how she feels.

So, I guess to start, can someone explain to me what this thing actually is? I've read some articles but, to be honest, they seem to be generally written for someone who is already ""initiated"" - meaning someone who isn't convinced this is simply a mental disorder. I can PM our chatlogs (I got permission, don't worry) once I figure out the easiest way to blur out the names involved. 

Finally, please, PLEASE believe me when I say I'm not trying to start a shitflinging contest here, and I'm not a fucking right wing subversive element here trying to stir up trouble and bring screencaps of ""st000pid SJWs"" back to my alt right friends.

The human in me loves everyone and respects the shit out of people for doing something about their gender dysphoria, but the scientist in me sees something wrong with our ideas about gender. 

So I think that gender should have everything to do with physical anatomy and that matters of the mind should be entirely left out of it. Keep in mind these are all thoughts from my own meditation and research. Why do we insist on maintaining the male/female duality after consistently acknowledging the transgender community? I was thinking ""What if we decided to have 4 genders instead?"" Standard male/female for those with both male/female primary/secondary characteristics. But also 2 other names for those who retain their natural primary sex organ and change their secondary sex characteristics.

I know it's controversial, but I still feel like it could help with legal transitions for those who want to keep primary sex organs.

If I had pushed back, I probably could have gotten by without it, but to win the game you have to play the game.

Total Price including blood work (no T test): $190
General appointment charge: $100
Required Bloodwork (pineal, estrogen, basic panel): $90
Optional Testosterone Test: $46

Recently, I set up an appointment for an informed consent preliminary appointment at Healthy Futures for Women in Denver, Colorado. I had an interesting experience there, and wanted to share what happened.

I called at the beginning of the week, and they gave me several options of when to have my appointment, 3 within the very same week. I chose one the following afternoon, wanting to expedite the process. The receptionist was very friendly when helping me schedule it, and even knew some trans terminology.

I was quite uncomfortable when I walked in, as the waiting room only had middle aged women sitting around, some with kids and some without, and I am 18 yrs amab pre-transition.

However, when I went up to the receptionist and told them my name and appt time, they were nice, and even asked if i had a preffered name (I'm sticking with my assigned name). I filled out paperwork for about 20 minutes, and the nurse came to get me about 5 minutes after I was done. I should also mention that appointment time includes check in, so you should expect to spend at least an hour and a half there if you are also doing blood work that day.

I was led to a private room, and the nurse took my vitals and asked me why I was there. When i mentioned HRT, she was surprised, but just kept asking me normal health questions. Weird reaction, but she turned out to be awesome.

Then Dr. Kate Weisenborn came in and asked me about my intent in starting HRT, and a bunch of doctor-y questions. When I told her how old I was, that created somewhat of an issue. she was immediately more guarded, and asked me if I was sure, and what I knew about HRT. I told her everything I knew, and about how much I wanted it, to finally stop the testosterone poisoning.

She left the room to print out the massive packet of medical information and all the consent forms. When she came back, she then asked me If I had been seeing a therapist about my gender. I told her yes, for a couple of months, but that he could't provide full recommendation letters, which is why I was going this route. Then, she told me that because I was so young, she was concerned about my decision, and wanted me to get a letter form the therapist. Not the full legal letter that's normally needed, but just a small note signed by him. Obviously, I was a mid upset, since isn't the point of informed consent NOT needing a letter? I could have pushed back, and i think she would agree if I had argued for it, but i was not it the mood, and I am pretty sure my therapist will be fine with it. She said that she would get the prescription ready, then as soon as they received the letter, they would send it to me. 

Then I got blood work done. It was a lot more expensive than I expected, and I needed to draw from savings, but I'm really glad that all I needed was the one appointment. 

Hopefully, I will have the prescription by the end of next week!

My presentation and identity are more genderqueer/transmasculine than FTM. I'm on a low dose of T and am planning to have top surgery, although I already have a small chest and have always looked pretty androgynous anyway. All I want out of this is a lower voice and some facial hair (I'm ok with downstairs growth as well, not something I actively desire but not something that would scare me off of being on T either). So I'm not planning to be on T indefinitely, just until I get the changes I want.

At this point in my life I've prioritized my own feelings when I look in the mirror, over the way society chooses to perceive my gender presentation. I've tried to work at feeling strong enough about my own identity, that other people's interpretations of it (i.e. being misgendered as female) are inconsequential. So I kinda told myself, I don't expect to pass all the time as male, depending on how my changes go on T...it's more important to simply feel comfortable, and that will give me the confidence to deal with how the rest of the world treats me.

And that's all fine and good in theory, but in practice it is much harder. It bothers me that it feels like society is forcing my hand to ""pick a side"" of the binary in a way that I want to remain fluid. It makes me sad and angry that no matter what the fuck I do with my presentation, I still seem to be a target for cat-calling and men calling to me at night like ""Goodnight miss"" ""have a good night ma'am."" You know, stuff like that. I hate the fact that it seems to happen more when I'm wearing nice clothes. I'm into fashion, I love my clothes, and I resent the fact that in order to stop this I would apparently have to dress much differently (i.e. less gay haha). I had a sort of dark ages phase in my mid-20's where I wasn't really affiliating with any subcultures anymore but didn't know how to dress otherwise, so my style was really bland and generic. Ironically, back then, I passed as male more often...but I just looked really boring. It's just not how I want to look.

So how then do I reconcile looking how I want, with the reality that I'm apparently not off these guys' radar yet? Has anyone had a similar experience? How long did it take until you stopped getting cat-called?

I have never really felt like a lady, but I didn't like arguing with my parents and still don't- even when I graduated from college I fought with my mom about wearing a dress and eventually gave in because she guilted me into it since my parents helped pay for college. And even today we argued about what I was wearing for a family cook out for the 4th- a t-shirt and shorts- because I ""needed to dress nicely and look like a lady"". Thing is, I would dress nicely, but my version of dressing nicely would include a masculine button up and nice shorts/pants or something, which I know is not what my mom has in mind. I wear mainly t shirts and shorts or jeans with hoodies because that is all that I own that I feel even somewhat comfortable in.

I also have dysphoria surrounding my chest (unfortunately DD), time of the month, and the length of my hair.

I'm also not the biggest fan of my super feminine name. I actually told a friend of mine that I was unsure of my gender and asked them to call me by the masculine variant of my name to try it out, and I love it in place of my birth name.  It could be considered a gender neutral name, but I love that it comes off as more masculine since that reflects me better.

But over the last 1.5 months my gender identity has been properly pinned down.  My life is fantastic!  I live in a national park, this park is my favorite place in the whole world and I get to live and work here for the summer. I have good friends and I make ok money and I live carefree of shit going on in a great welcoming and fun place.  

I have a secret I haven't told anyone except an old high school friend who now identifies as trans that I am genderfluid.  And that I have pretty bad dysphoria with myself (AMAB).  I want to pass as both genders and tell people what to use based on what I feel but I haven't come out and while I eventually want to but the prospect is very scary. How do I get to where I want to? Well that's next on my bucket list to think about.

I figured out my gender was screwed up over the course of a year and a half.  I like my little pony,  this cartoon show changed my perspective on gender, it allowed me to explore my cis, straight assumptions I had.  The first thing out the window was straight.  That was pretty quick to come as I started introspecting and realizing that I had boy crushes and this one guy who sparked it all.  It wasn't until a few weeks ago that my gender identify went all fucked up.  The term male was randomly so shallow for how I felt.  I liked female pronouns at times I WANTED to be female at times.  I buried these forever and then I just couldn't hold it back anymore.  I struggled with what I was but genderfluid made so much sense.  I want to pass as male and female and say what I feel like based on what I feel like.  I thought I could hold these feelings back as I was kinda content being masculine.  

Then in creeped the dysphoria.  It's just THERE.  I don't want to change my sex I just want to change my face so bad.  I hate my facial hair.  This week and last week it crept in and I realized I can't live just male.  It's denying how I feel too much.  I just want to be able to be misgendered and then correct people.  The one time this happened it felt so right.  It happened to someone else on Tuesday and that felt so right.

And thus where I am now.  I am terrified to come out.  My family would be confused ambit accepting I think.  The only reason I make this long ass rambling post about a bunch of my feelings is because I need it out and I need an outlet.  And for now reddit is my outlet.  I get to be genuine here.  

My mental health is great outside of this.  Nothing to put pressure on me.  I am very happy with my life.  So I don't feel super bad about bottling up a bit and making sure I have an idea of what it is I want until I out myself slowly.

This is the first song they released that's not inspired by Life is Strange (which is an awesome game BTW). Koethe's not planning on revealing the official meaning of the song for a while, but it seems to have strong non-binary themes to me. (Binary code, X &amp; Y, define on the line, and the whole narrative really) What do you think?

The lyrics:
&gt;(Verse 1)  
“By default or by design?”  
Hope to,  
In a desperate bid, define  
On the line  
While stands another side  
What I thought that I could hide  
With time  

&gt;(Chorus 1)  
Don’t tell me don’t tell me  
What I am of  
You’re zeros and ones but I knew  
This is all this is all  
That I ever was  
It’s overdue  

&gt;(Verse 2)  
In a head of holes I find  
You complicate  
Consumed with the what and why  
The way you operate  
Yet In the waking mind  
It becomes a part of mine  
Somethings not right  

&gt;(Chorus 2)  
Don’t tell me don’t tell me  
What I am of  
You’re zeros you’re ones but I knew  
This is all this is all  
That I ever was  
It’s overdue  

&gt;(Verse 3)  
Like the noose around my neck  
You suffocate  
So enamored of the lie  
Of X and Y  
And with eyes held open wide  
But still to be so blind  
I find  

&gt;(Chorus 3)  
Don’t tell me don’t tell me  
What I am of  
You’re zeros and ones but I knew

I've been in the process of coming out as nonbinary since the beginning of this year, and more publicly/openly the past few months. And I've been out as bi for a couple years. In the past, I've thought that most of my crushes (generally more masculine, regardless of gender) were mostly to do with my bi orientation. 

BUT, now that I'm sorting through and figuring out my gender identity, I realize that it's less of a ""I wanna frick you"" thing, and more of a ""I wanna BE you"" thing (especially for my male-bodied crushes)! 

So now, when I obsess over celebrity crushes *cough Martin Freeman cough Josh Homme cough*, I dunno, gender things just click. And I feel more confident in my body when I wear my favorite suit or style my hair a certain way. It's like, ""I think I look hot!""

I'm a bi, cisgendered guy, but have had some trouble understanding how being genderqueer works. I hope none of what I say comes across as offensive, that is not my intention at all. I would love to learn about this community so I can become more tolerant.

My major issue with understanding this community is my belief, or understanding that gender is a binary, at least socially. Physically people may be born without a clear gender, but socially gender seems to be pretty simple. We have stereotypes and social mores regarding what it means to be male or female. 
My question is basically, does a genderqueer person feel they are biologically between genders or socially between genders?
For example, do you feel like you have a set of genitals, but feel you belong to a different body? 
Or do you feel you are forced into social mores that you want to be free from? And why does being a feminine man or a masculine woman not go far enough?

I would really appreciate any feedback, since I desperately want to be able to say I support this community, as it is so evidentially full of wonderful people.

Basically, on my femme days/days off from work where I'm closeted I like the look of crop tops with high-waist shorts or pants (I have pretty long legs and I like to emphasize that). The problem is that since I don't tuck, it's hard for me to find high waist pants that don't give me a very unfortunate ""moose knuckle."" I'm fine with wearing men's jeans but they often have a super low waist even though I feel like that went out of style a while ago, lol.

Have any other AMAB folks had a similar problem (with any pants, not just high-waist) finding pants that fit? I have a couple friends who sew so I've considered purchasing jeans and having them altered if that's an option, or shopping vintage since I think ""men's"" pants with a higher waist were more common in the past. I've also seen that Topshop carries high-waist women's pants in tall sizes, but I haven't tried them on yet because gender-segregated fitting rooms suck and they're quite expensive for me ($70 USD a pair).

I'm talking mostly about stuff on r/changemyview . It seems like every other day there's another post about gender identity. Here's how it goes:

1. The OP's view is respectful, but misinformed. I notice the top comments are all from cis people, and they're well-intentioned but flawed.

2. I, having no memory for pain, leave a reply to OP's comment, clarifying a few points and specifying that I know all this because, unlike a lot of the other commenters, I'm trans.

3. After a little while, I get one or two comments. Respectful ones! Oh, look, they're curious about my experience. They're so polite, I should respond!

4. Here I get one or two not-as-respectful questions on my original comment. It's not r/the_donald or anything, but they say things like ""transgenderism"" and ask things like, ""How do you know if you're actually trans and not just into manly/feminine things?""

5. I answer these questions too, because the commenter seems curious and not vicious. After all, this was a question I had when I was questioning my own identity.

6. Cue the thousand word responses heavily implying (but of COURSE not saying!) that I'm wrong, my identity is wrong, I'm just a dumb cis who likes boy things. *(Oh, yeah, and at least one of the seemingly-respectful comments from earlier ends up down this road, too.)*

7. Cue the thousand word replies from your's truly, who just *can't for the life of them stop correcting these jerks*, for no real reason.

8. Repeat steps 6-7 until I get too fed up or dysphoric to continue.

I don't get it. No matter how many times or how many ways I try to explain what it's like - to feel disconnected and lost, and then to feel whole - people seem determined not to understand. (Lol, can you tell I'm young?)

Maybe I should be more jaded. I should just accept that I can't convince everybody, and life isn't fair, and I probably shouldn't even be trying. I should just live my life for myself and not bother.

I just can't get it out of my head, though. That if I can just find the right words in the right order, I can make them understand. If not to make my life easier, than maybe somebody else's. I want so badly to reach people.

They used to be a very small, very casual office and she is the receptionist's assistant. She used to be out of view of clients, but they have been growing rapidly and are moving to a new, larger office. 

She will now be sitting in the reception area in view of clients, so her torn 2 sizes too big jeans, old t-shirts and threadbare hoody which she wears daily are no longer ok.

I have a solution for the sweater because old navy carries athletic zip ups that are mich nicer looking without being frilly/feminine, and several others in her office wear something similar so we know it passes muster.

Though I feel awkward and uncomfortable about that. Dressing overtly feminine, I feel like I'm dressed up like something I'm not. I feel like a phony.

But when I am contrasted with men and made to feel or bring seen or treated like a woman, blah. It's caused a lot of discomfort and anxiety. Even just be called a girl is uncomfortable.

 For the past few years I have gradually shifted away from some of my femininity at least in terms of appearance. I have a mixture of mens and womens clothing. Ive cut my hair short. I've dated both men and women, although my relationships have been more significant with women. Though, generally speaking, most of the women have been quite adrogynous and our relationships were typically quite balanced with gender roles not really playing any role.

I'm particularly uncomfortable when juxtaposed with the men, or even in a situation where there is another female where I feel like the men might expect me to act or be or look like them. And that's so uncomfortable. It might just be all in my head. But regardless, I feel a tug of war between genders. I don't feel like either.  

I think I have lovely feminine traits and good masculine ones too. Sometimes I don't mind looking prettier. Sometimes I intentionally dress more boyish, though, I would never ever pass as a man. I'm uncomfortable with my breasts, wearing high compression sports bras and having purchased a binder (though, it's too hot to wear it right now). I also am very uncomfortable about my hips. 

My partner is very supportive and okay with it  and attracted to me regardless. He's completely okay with me identifying as genderqueer.  Though, still, in comparison, I'm the feminine one in the relationship.

**Life before late 2013**

In retrospect, I was not normal.  I never picked up on this, despite the fact that, when I was about three, I asked my parents when I could be a girl.  Really?  *That* didn't tip me off?  I'm a bit dense sometimes.

Also, I grew long hair, just cause.

&amp;nbsp;

**Late 2013**

Some friends and I decided on the spur of the moment to braid my hair.  Then to put on makeup.  And I decided ""Let's make me some boobs.""  Then I sat there, pretending to be this ""alter ego.""  I never put on any ""girl"" clothes, save for some heels.  We came up with this elaborate (not really) plan to trick potential new students at our high school into thinking there was me and my twin sister at orientation.  ('Twas a boarding school, and I loved it, for the record.)  Never did it, but I liked the idea, and found myself thinking *How do I make this the most convincing?*

Anyways, after all that, I found myself feeling like there was something inside me, wanting to be let out.  I decided that it was just some weird psychological phenomenon related to cross-dressing and dismissed it. (Blegh.  I know.  Really?)

&amp;nbsp;

**September 2015**
One of my friends who helped with the above thing came and visited me and my other friends in college.  We decided to revisit that night.  But this time, another friend who was there, about the same size as me (I'm average AFAB size), went and got one of her dresses, and another friend made me better boobs.  It was weird, but satisfying, and prompted me to reconsider a Halloween idea me and some friends had.  We were going to be (never were) a heavy metal band (two of us have long hair, perfect for headbanging), and I decided to be female (never did) for Halloween.  I found myself delving deeply into how to be convincing, decided to take some online ""gender quizzes"" out of curiosity, found one that actually seemed pretty good at the time (mediocre now, but better than those silly 10 question ones) and it told me I was androgynous.  I decided that didn't *quite* fit me, but decided genderfluid worked better.  I discovered then that I was not cis.

A friend said to me at one point ""You know, if you decide to go all out (meaning MtF), I will support you all the way.""  Outside, I was like ""Ok.""  Inside, my brain kinda did a double take.  I hadn't really thought of that.

&amp;nbsp;

**October 2015**

Over time, my male side faded and my female side took over.  I decided I actually was MtF.  I went to a horse farm, and this woman was talking to her daughter (I had already gone out in girl-mode, I wasted no time) and told her to brush her horse ""like she is,"" referring to me.  I was happy.  But I stopped the girl mode when I got back to school, where people who were not my friends but still knew who I was might recognize me.

I told my parents.  They were fine.  My sister doesn't know.  It would be a little too weird for her.  I'm busy breaking down the idea of gender rigidity and roles for her first, to make it less of a big deal.

&amp;nbsp;

**Rest of Fall 2015**

I was getting this thing called dysphoria.  It didn't make sense to me.  Why would I have it?  I was a very calm transgender person.  It seemed more social, though, as I didn't feel like I could present like I wanted to.  I would sit in my dorm room alone and brood, at a couple points, even cry.  It didn't make sense.  Gender didn't make sense.  Nothing made sense.  I was able to get myself up and go to dinner with friends, so that really helped, as I knew it would.  But I even cried at dinner once.

&amp;nbsp;

**Christmas Break 2015-2016**

I began questioning again.  I knew that maleness was gone, but the femaleness seemed to be unfitting, too, after some time.  My friends were super supportive, so I thought that maybe they were too supportive, and accidentally didn't let me think for myself once I got the ball rolling.  Once I could, I decided I was agender.

&amp;nbsp;

**January 2016**

I got diagnosed with T1 Diabetes.  I realized that, as long as I had had the symptoms, it was likely that a small amount of dysphoria was exaggerated into what I got the previous fall.  So yeah.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Rest of Spring 2016**

I joined my college's social club for lgbt people.  It was a great decision.  That first night, we went to dinner together.  While leaving, I looked at my reflection in the door and was confused by it.  Was that really me?  It didn't look bad, but it didn't look right, either.  Made a mental note of that real fast.

Had a couple times when feminine feelings emerged for a short time.  They left fairly quickly.

&amp;nbsp;

**Summer 2016** *(including now)*

Really started managing my diabetes well.  Got a pump and sensor, so I'm pretty much set.  Also got a job in retail.  I get an even mixture, it seems, of ""Ma'am"" and ""Sir,"" and the kids are comical sometimes with their perception of me.  Funny thing is, I don't present at all.  I just dress malely, but I still have my long hair.  Maybe there's something I do subconsiously?  I have no idea.  But I think this started something.  I looked at my legs one day, saw the hair, and did not like it.  From there, thoughts of being more feminine slowly returned.  I wanted to dream it again like I did before.  I realized that it might not be harmful to ace-bandage my lower abdomen for the curves as long as I'm careful (with a pump, a corset is a big no, and I don't really like them anyway).  Kinda increased more and more.  Then, a couple of nights ago, I got irritable.  Out of nowhere, it seemed.  I thought it was just cause I was hungry (I was).  Next day, it was a **FLOOD** of femininity and dysphoria.  I didn't want to leave my room at risk of my family noticing something was wrong (I hate that for some silly reason, I think I'm too prideful).  Honestly, I didn't really want to do anything.  That was scary.  It is scary.  It sounds like depression.  I've been depressed before, everyone has, but that was intense and out of nowhere.  I never really fully recovered, either, which is the scariest part.  *It's persistant.*  I can cover it up, but my interactions don't feel sincere now.  Only when I'm fully immersed in something does it go away.  Then it comes back afterward.  This is new.  And I now know that it's *not* the diabetes.  And I have a couple of really good friends who have no idea, but I want so badly to tell them, but I'm scared.

I'm confused.

&amp;nbsp;

My friends were super supportive, so I thought that maybe they were too supportive, and accidentally didn\'t let me think for myself once I got the ball rolling.  Once I could, I decided I was agender.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**January 2016**\n\nI got diagnosed with T1 Diabetes.  I realized that, as long as I had had the symptoms, it was likely that a small amount of dysphoria was exaggerated into what I got the previous fall.  So yeah.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**The Rest of Spring 2016**\n\nI joined my college\'s social club for lgbt people.  It was a great decision.  That first night, we went to dinner together.  While leaving, I looked at my reflection in the door and was confused by it.  Was that really me?  It didn\'t look bad, but it didn\'t look right, either.  Made a mental note of that real fast.\n\nHad a couple times when feminine feelings emerged for a short time.  They left fairly quickly.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Summer 2016** *(including now)*\n\nReally started managing my diabetes well.  Got a pump and sensor, so I\'m pretty much set.  Also got a job in retail.  I get an even mixture, it seems, of ""Ma\'am"" and ""Sir,"" and the kids are comical sometimes with their perception of me.  Funny thing is, I don\'t present at all.  I just dress malely, but I still have my long hair.  Maybe there\'s something I do subconsiously?  I have no idea.  But I think this started something.  I looked at my legs one day, saw the hair, and did not like it.  From there, thoughts of being more feminine slowly returned.  I wanted to dream it again like I did before.  I realized that it might not be harmful to ace-bandage my lower abdomen for the curves as long as I\'m careful (with a pump, a corset is a big no, and I don\'t really like them anyway).  Kinda increased more and more.  Then, a couple of nights ago, I got irritable.  Out of nowhere, it seemed.  I thought it was just cause I was hungry (I was).  Next day, it was a **FLOOD** of femininity and dysphoria.  I didn\'t want to leave my room at risk of my family noticing something was wrong (I hate that for some silly reason, I think I\'m too prideful).  Honestly, I didn\'t really want to do anything.  That was scary.  It is scary.  It sounds like depression.  I\'ve been depressed before, everyone has, but that was intense and out of nowhere.  I never really fully recovered, either, which is the scariest part.  *It\'s persistant.*  I can cover it up, but my interactions don\'t feel sincere now.  Only when I\'m fully immersed in something does it go away.  Then it comes back afterward.  This is new.  And I now know that it\'s *not* the diabetes.  And I have a couple of really good friends who have no idea, but I want so badly to tell them, but I\'m scared.\n\nI\'m confused.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nTL;DR Thought I was cis, then genderfluid, then mtf, then agender, now confused, maybe depressed, don\'t know what to do, too many things in my head, can\'t untangle them all, needed to vent, and want some advice.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I'm confused (background story inbound)"", 'created': 1469372154.0}"

In the first party's Facebook description, girls were encouraged to wear suits if they had any. I (partially) jokingly asked, ""Oh, so guys can't wear dresses? :P"". Alas, there was no problem at all. A friend in her suit even carried me around like a princess haha.

Yesterday, I was feeling a bit dysphoric and decided to wear a simple skirt while working on homework. I later had a few drinks. Then, I felt the urge to change into another outfit, put on my favorite wig, and go out for a walk around my apartment complex. It was certainly not the safest time to go out for a walk (about 3-4 in the morning when I left). I fortunately decided to at least sober up before departing. Then, I grabbed a satchel-thingamajig to hold my stuff. My hands were a bit shaky as I grabbed a cigarette and stepped outside in little more than a skirt, tank top (over some padding), and sneakers.

It was pretty nerve-racking at first. Now that I think about it, my walking pace was definitely quicker than normal. Along the way, I heard some people talking next to an outdoor grill. I also walked right past the front of a running car before realizing it. A couple even walked past me in a somewhat dim area. Nobody said anything to me, which was a huge relief. Eventually, my walking pace slowed down. I was still nervous, but tried to focus on using more... feminine body language to increase my chances of passing at night (6'1"", maybe 150lbs). Still not tired, I decided to drive to my nearby campus and walk around.

On the way there, a police car came up behind me pretty quickly. I was mostly scared of them seeing what I was wearing as a result of being pulled over. Fortunately, I switched lanes and they sped past me.

Only animals and traffic of nearby roads could be heard from campus. As I walked past the library, I stared at my reflection in the window. It was scary to be crossdressing in public, at night, and alone. But damn, it was exhilarating and gave me a sense of pride. 

I've been called vulgar names for no apparent reason by random people driving by. The amount of people that have been jumped or harassed for being ""different"" is certainly a concern. However, last night was quite a confidence boost. It's tempting to go out again earlier tonight, even if that means that more people would be around.

If you'd ever like to try something similar, I'd highly recommend going with friends. I think that having them along for protection, conversation, and general support could make it easier to expand your comfort zone.

I feel like this is a common issue with AFAB people - do I want to be seen in a masculine way because that is part of my identity, or because I'm sick of all the problems that being seen as a woman bring in my society? This is something I keep struggling with.

As I've grown up I've seen more and more acceptance of cis people expressing a ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" side. It's ok for a girl to wear masculine clothes and have a masculine haircut. We're still kinda not quite there on the other side of things but I think acceptance for men acting in feminine ways has at least improved. But especially focusing on the girl side of things, these expressions are accepted for people who still identify as women.

I grew up a tomboy, and gender really started to be an issue at puberty, but I don't know if it's really for the same reasons that would indicate I'm anything other than female. I remember crying the night my mom pointed out I was growing breasts. I don't hate my breasts now, but I think in that moment something in me knew I wasn't going to be seen the way I wanted anymore. I played water polo, and I dreaded when I would turn 14 and have to play with the girls only. This is when these thoughts really came up - I wished I could be a boy so I could have the same comraderie that the guys had with each other. I tried to recreate that with them but I knew they didn't look at me the same, especially in an environment where precieved gender is glaringly obvious at all times. But I worry that this is also because I was frequently bullied by girls and wanted friends in general.

I thought these feelings were gone when I left high school. I thought I finally accepted I could be seen as a girl, called a girl, but still be who I am. But more recently I'm finding that's just not working. 

I'd be fine dressing how I liked and looking how I wanted with no real effort toward presentation one way or the other if it didn't feel like everyone around me wanted to remind me that they see me as a girl all the time. It's in little things - my dad's fiancé saying that she'll help the girls in the family pick out dresses for the wedding before turning to me and saying I'm next for her to help, a friend tagging only me and my female friend in a picture of painted nails, people I play at mtg calling me ""lady"" and ""m'am"", people praising me for ""finally dressing like a girl"" when I dress up, female friends and family members talking about feminine things with ""oh you know how we women deal with our men"" or ""women's intuition"". I'm probably not making much sense.

But I feel like all of these can be explained away by me being some big feminist who is also obstinate and contrarian. 

But there's another part to it too - I've had some moments where I've been ""mistaken"" for masculine or middle of the road and enjoyed it. 

When I was 14 I went to the Costco bathrooms. My hair was short and I wore a thick swimmer coat. A woman stopped me on the way going ""hey! You're not supposed to be going in there!"" I turned around, and she looked super embarrassed and explained she thought I was a boy. I told my parents about how funny it was and I remember my mom being really angry and I was just so happy for some reason. It's why I still remember it so clearly.

I've also had a lot of moments where people have told me I write men really well, how in my writing I can easily switch between perspectives of two genders. I've taken a bunch of tests that have often shown I'm in the middle and it makes me so happy (even though I don't really believe in the scientific validity of these tests)

Soooo.

I am... not small-chested.  I currently wear a 38J/JJ and frankly the left tit *still* spills out of the bra a bit at times.  I'm frustrated by my inability to convincingly wear clothes from the menswear section of shops, and am finding that my occasional bouts of dysphoria tend to focus a lot on, among other things, my chest.

*  Binder measuring guide for GC2B states I should base my binder size on the measurement of my chest above the breasts/ across the armpit.  Which makes sense in general, but I'm worried that, since the difference between my upper chest/full bust measurement is a lot larger than normal, this might result in a binder that is full-on *painful* to wear.  How have other folks found the sizing?
*  Can a binder actually convincingly flatten a chest as large as mine?  Can the GC2B ones?
*  I have some sensory issues around clothing.  I don't mind tight foundation garments in some areas, but if waistbands and hems are too thin or bulky, that tends to be intolerable to me especially on tight-fitting things.  What are the edges of the GC2B binders like?  Are there other binders that might be better comfort-wise?
*  How long is the binding area of the binder?  The thing about tits this big is, they tend to be kinda *long* themselves.  So I'd need something that had a fairly deep binding section, lest I end up with my chest still jutting out... just halfway down my torso.
*  How *long* is the full-length binder?  I have a long torso, and nothing is as uncomfortable for me as something that ends too high up.  It's inevitably going to roll up awkwardly, feel uncomfortable and look kinda shitty on me.  Does this brand of binder come down nice and low - say mid-bottom hip?

174,2016-07-29 16:25:22,4v7f9h,7,10," Hello. This will be very long to read. But i am really helpless and i hope you read till the end.

 I dont know how to explain myself. It is because my confusion, depression and some language barriers. I am from a conservative country which is located at middle east. and i am a 19 years old medical student. I am AFAB. I have been struggling this gender stuff for 2.5 years. I have never identified as female. I dont know what makes a person female or male. And I wonder if cis-females have that feeling saying ""YES I AM A FEMALE"".
 
 Firstly i want to talk about myself and my family. I have social fobia, chronic depression(which is really hard to me) and some strange behaviors i dont know how to put a name. For example i dont speak much, i am extremely shy and people always tell me that i always look nervous. I blame my family for these. I grew up a home with domestic violence. My family is hyper parents, they are strictly protective. They never let me have my own voice and choices. Even when I am 17 I couldnt stayed alone at home becuse they think i cant take care of myself. Of course these are not related with my gender but i think these are important in how i perceive my gender and how my gender makes me feel.
The problem is i dont know if i should go transitioning. I dont have any genderqueer friends. I talk to trans males. They tell me that they have always knew it that they were male. They were always into boys' stuff etc. I don't have these features and this makes me depressed. I feel like i dont fit trans community and i dont deserve to transition. Am i a lie? But i want flat chest, some body hair etc. ı see a therapist for being transgender and she asks me that normative questions that if i played with girls or boys.

This will be very long to read. But i am really helpless and i hope you read till the end.\n\n I dont know how to explain myself. It is because my confusion, depression and some language barriers. I am from a conservative country which is located at middle east. and i am a 19 years old medical student. I am AFAB. I have been struggling this gender stuff for 2.5 years. I have never identified as female. I dont know what makes a person female or male. And I wonder if cis-females have that feeling saying ""YES I AM A FEMALE"".\n \n Firstly i want to talk about myself and my family. I have social fobia, chronic depression(which is really hard to me) and some strange behaviors i dont know how to put a name. For example i dont speak much, i am extremely shy and people always tell me that i always look nervous. I blame my family for these. I grew up a home with domestic violence. My family is hyper parents, they are strictly protective. They never let me have my own voice and choices. Even when I am 17 I couldnt stayed alone at home becuse they think i cant take care of myself. Of course these are not related with my gender but i think these are important in how i perceive my gender and how my gender makes me feel.\nThe problem is i dont know if i should go transitioning. I dont have any genderqueer friends. I talk to trans males. They tell me that they have always knew it that they were male. They were always into boys\' stuff etc. I don\'t have these features and this makes me depressed. I feel like i dont fit trans community and i dont deserve to transition. Am i a lie?

178,2016-07-30 04:40:06,4vanbm,3,8,"Guessing you guys get a lot of these posts, but here's mine...

So as it stands, I'm AFAB and bisexual. I'm totally cool with being bi, that's pretty much said and done. I've assumed that I'm cis because being AFAB hasn't been upsetting to me.

However, once I came out as bi I figured I could be a little more open with my gender fuckery (as in before I came out I would try to dress 'straight', but now that I'm out I can dress and act 'queerer'). I've always dressed very tomboy-ish, (no makeup, jeans/shorts, simple hairstyles, etc) I recently started wearing baseball caps, and fell in love with the way they looked backwards. I loved the masculinity that it seemed to imply, I've been obsessed. I've even thought about purchasing a pair of boxer-briefs (they look so comfy, but I dunno how they work with AFAB anatomy). 

Lately I've had a fascination with suits. I've always felt uncomfortable getting all made-up for fancy events, and I don't like wearing dresses. I chalked that up to not being used to moving in flowy dresses and having fancy hair, and really disliking formal events in general. When I considered wearing a suit, though, things were different. I would love to rock a sharp suit to a formal event. I've even toyed with the idea of being a drag king.

That's the dress component, which isn't really confusing to me. What is confusing is this weird psychological aspect. When I swing (in attraction) to men, I want to act more masculine. I've looked up on several occasions how to walk/talk/act more masculine, but they weren't much help. In fact, they made me really uncomfortable. 

The things that irked me were how feminine some of my mannerisms were, and that irked me because it showed me I'm more feminine than I realized. I couldn't help but be a little jilted at that notion, but I couldn't put my finger on why. In the same vein, things that confirmed me as more masculine (or even androgynous) felt really nice in a way that I also can't really explain. I like being a little taller than average (and the consequent bigger hands and feet). I'd also prefer my voice to a little lower, but I've accepted that that is what it is.

I thought about it more, and found that I really object to being called cute, beautiful, or pretty. I prefer attractive, dapper, or sharp (though she/her pronouns still feel fine for some reason). I also don't like being called a woman, maybe it's because I'm not very ""mature"", but it doesn't sit right with me. 

I just...don't know. When I imagine being a guy, hanging out with other guys, that doesn't feel right. But in my experience, I don't have many shared experiences in terms of gender (besides, like, periods) with girls. 

I guess some guidance with this would be nice, but I mostly wanted to get this said.

I'm having a specific problem in dating and relationships.  I'm 35, and I tend to look much younger than I am, often as much as 10 years younger.  The people I've dated have mostly been cis women who go for feminine guys, with one bi person who dated mostly women, and one nonbinary pan person.  I'm mostly attracted to women.  When I was younger I dated more people closer to my age, but these days I'm most attracted to people who are around 20-28ish.  The age disparity is causing several problems for me:

* I meet a lot of women who initially seem interested in me, but many tell me that they would never date someone as old as me.
* I now have a zero or near-zero positive response rate on dating sites / apps (in the past I've met people off Okcupid with sometimes good results).  I've gotten messages on Okcupid from women who explicitly told me that they thought I was lying about my age, and my friends have told me that if they saw me on Tinder and didn't know me, they'd probably think I had lied about my age too, based on my pics.  I'm not sure if there's any way for me to actually use these sites / apps with this problem.
* I have been getting frustrated when I connect on deep intellectual and emotional levels with younger women, and then I see them turn around and date men closer to their age or even younger, who don't seem as mature or intelligent, or when I meet someone and then find out that she is into casual sex.  (I'm open to people in loving polyamorous relationships, or people who have sex outside of relationships, but I don't want to date people who are into casual sex or anonymous / drunk sex.)
* I meet very few single people close to my age that I find attractive, and when I do, they usually seem uninterested in me and I find it even hard to get to know or form friendships with these people.
* The dynamic of me being attracted to younger women is one way in which my sexuality plays out like a ""typical straight male"", if that makes sense?  But I find that this then feeds into a lot of social norms that I feel uncomfortable with the gender dynamics of, because I don't like playing the stereotypically male role in relationships or sexual interactions.  I have a strong desire for symmetry and equality, and I like switching roles and playing both roles as much as possible.  Being interested in younger women, I find places me in a role where I'm expected to take greater initiative, and that plays off my insecurities.  I also have a deep insecurity about being perceived as creepy or threatening, and the age difference in attraction also plays into this insecurity.

Has anyone here struggled with any of these things?  Or even if you haven't, are there any ideas or insights you could share that could help me to navigate these issues?

Some days I feel male, other days I'm female, more like 20/80, 20 percent male 80 percent female, yet I dont identify as trans.

I want to start passing as female but am too scared to use the changing rooms in Select Fashions for fear of being seen as a perv and security guards in shops with radios on thinking I'm a shoplifter.

This is the top I like - http://www.selectfashion.co.uk/clothing/s043-1403-046_black.html but I'm too embarrassed to go in ans try it on let alone buy it.

My feminine side is the same personality as me, no real change in interests, except uber-feminine in look.

I'm attracted to women, not men, both as man and woman.

Officially, I identify as a guy, for work, anyway, but outside of, I'm both.

Chapeltown here in Sheffield isn't great for LGBT, genderfluid, whatever so I need help on this/.

I need to gain some confidence but how can I start to be my true self so to speak?

Anyone here from around my area? I sometimes go up to Pitsmoor and Grenoside but they're not really accepting of LGBT let alone genderfluid people so I hear...

Just need advice from everyone.

I'm 15 and AMAB and have been experiencing minor to moderate dysphoria on and off for most of my life. I discounted it for a long time, even for a couple years after I began encountering and being cool with LGBT people in 2013 or so. About 7 months ago now I decided I was probably genderfluid. In general, I tended to ID as male or female for a few hours or at the most days. But about a month and a half ago, I chose a feminine name and ever since then (well, really a couple hours before then, but y'know), I've identified as female. This is by far the longest amount of time I've been one gender since before I decided I was genderfluid. Is there any time that I should presume I'm not going to identify as male again and simply refer to myself as a transgender woman? If so, when? Any help or info would be appreciated.

Typically, this part doesn't cause me issues. I, pretty much 100% of the time, like the fact that I don't have boobs to deal with. What I don't like is that my upper arms and shoulders can make a good bit of ""women's"" tops not fit right.

Socially, my obvious AMAB status makes it awkward to want to hang around a bunch of girls, as it serves to present even more of a contrast. Also, living in a more conservative area, where most guys are into cars and sports and crap like that, it sometimes gets awkward being a ""guy"" around a bunch of ""girl talk.""

That being said, I also suffer some dysphoria when I'm around a bunch of guys. Partly it's because I'm reminded of how feminine I really am inside when these guys are discussing things. I also have a bit of a feminine-ish curve (albeit more boyish than girlish at certain points) to my body when you go down from my waist.

I don't tend to hate my body, but when I've been shopping for things like jeans or tops, I'm reminded of how much I don't tend to fit either of the ""norms."" Like, my really thick thighs and somewhat girlish curve means that girls jeans tend to fit better, but seeing the more guyish upper half to my body, I feel kinda stupid at times when wanting to wear girls jeans. I also know that it'd be very easy to spot that I'm wearing them when hanging around with a group of guys and girls.

I've always found myself attracted to girls as well, which makes the hanging out with a group of girls more awkward, especially considering the attitudes that ""girls and guys can't be just friends."" Even though I'm AMAB, when I think about being sexually active, my junk isn't used in the typical AMAB way, at least not primarily. When I think about being sexually active, I think about me being with a girl and focusing less on ""tab a into slot b"" and more on what might be able to be described as typical lesbian actions rather than typical heterosexual actions (the best way I could describe it in a short burst).

Socially, I don't mind my male name nor being referred to as a guy. I'm like, yeah, I've always been ""Name"" and I'm a guy, at least by a binary physical status. I think, realistically, as it relates to presentation, I prefer the identity of ""genderqueer"" but there are times I can feel a bit of shift, enough to feel more or less at ease being associated by company within a group of guys or girls.

Most of my dysphoria doesn't seem to come from direct hatred of my body but rather feeling a shift in myself that sometimes comes from who I'm around. It's like, I get reminded of how much I really am different from the people I'm around.

I could be in the girliest outfit possible, but I see an AFAB girl in a similar outfit and I'm reminded just how stupid I must seem. Alternatively, I could be dressed in the most typical guy fashion, but spend time around guys and be reminded of how much I don't identify or agree with the way that ""guys are"" (I can catch myself thinking ""guys are stupid"" or stuff like that and feel like I'm speaking about guys as a separate group from myself).

30,2016-07-19 10:20:09,4tkfp8,4,4,"Hey, I'm a 16 year old female and I'm not sure what I am. 
I've had an identity crisis since I can remember and I'm getting sick of it. 
It really began when I was 6, I was in love with my best friend who was a girl. I didn't really think about it, I just knew I wanted to be with her forever. Later I learned about being gay, and I quickly accepted I was a lesbian. 
My memory from when I was younger is very bad, I think it's because I was very depressed most of the time. I remember my family always told me to smile once, because I never did. I don't exactly know why I was always sad, I just saw no joy in life. 
When I was between 8 and 12 I always enjoyed playing with boys more than girls. I cut my hair short because I wanted to be one of them, but while my hair was short I also hung out with girls who told me my short hair was weird. So I decided to let it grow long again. 
When I was 12 I also fell in love with another female friend, I tried to let het know with small hints but I don't she ever got it. 
Around that time I also learned about transgenders, and I wondered if I was a transgender too. 
I also noticed boys got interested in me, I was a girl who was addicted to minecraft like most boys that time. I made a lot of friends because of that, but most of those friendships got ruined when they started telling me they were in love with me. I was not even thinking about a relationship with a boy, so they stopped hanging out with me. 
I've always struggled with social anxiety, and that anxiety got very bad when I was 14. I had a huge fight with a friend of mine, she thought I was flirting with her crush because I was hanging out with him a lot. But all I wanted was a male friend. She was the most populair girl in my friend circle, so I couldnt hang out with most of my friends anymore.
I think anxiety is the reason I stopped hanging out with boys. I was scared people thought I was weird.
A few friends stayed with me after the fight. One of them was a guy who people said had a crush on me. We were both very shy, I think I was in love with him but I never told him. That was when I got confused if I really was a lesbian. I never told anyone that I was a lesbian btw, I just never talked about love stuff with my friends. 
I think I was 14 when I told people in my class I was lesbian, I never told my parents because we don't have a close relationship and I feel like it would be awkward. 
I never got problems for being lesbian because in my country being gay isn't a very big deal. I just felt very unconfortable knowing my female friends knew I'm gay. I've always been a bit awkward because of my anxiety, so I was scared my best friend would think I was in love with her.  So I later told them I wasn't lesbian after all. 
I was struggling very hard at that time with who I was, in online games I started telling people I was a guy, but later made a new account telling I was a girl. When I was a girl I wanted to be a guy and when I was a guy I wanted to be a girl. One day I will look in the mirror hating my breasts and the next day I will look in the mirror wishing they were bigger.  
When I was 15 I cut my hair really short, thinking it'd make me happier but it didn't. All I wanted was for it to grow long again. I missed the attention I got from guys.
Last year I got into a new class without any of my old friends. And since I'm very bad at making friends I sat alone most of the time. I made 1 new female friend, but we didn't hang out much. I also made a male friend, but he got depressed and didn't want to talk with me about it so we stopped talking.
Being my most lonely year, it was also my happiest year, I finally got out of my depression, and I started to love life. I feel like one of the luckiest people on earth and my dream is to share my luck with others. My anxiety is still as bad though.
I also feel like I'm falling back into my depression becausr I became scared of beigg alone and sleeping because I hate my thoughts right now.
I still hang out with my old friends sometimes, and we go to parties together but I keep feeling I don't belong with them and that they invite me because they feel bad for me. 
Recently I learned my anxiety is a lot less after drinking alcohol, so I can't wait for the parties I'll have this summer. 
My one wish is to find a male friend to talk with about girls &amp; stuff. That's what I always wanted. And maybe I'll find out if I'm trans or genderfluid or just lesbian.

Some times ago, I even thought I might be a trans-man. So I finally looked into the net to help me with all those disphoria I've been having. And I finally discovered this reddit who helped a lot.

Now, I'm searching for some idea to perfect my ""guy look"". I have long hair that I don't wish to cut for now (don't know why). I think that I have a face close to one of an androgyne, but I think my eyes are too big to be masculine. And the worse : I have natural curves which I don't really like (sorry for the AMAB out there, I'll gladly donate them if I could). I have large shoulders but rather normal waist and large hip/butt/thighs for a guy.

So here are my questions :
- Is there some FAAB or AMAB here with long hair, and what do you do with them on guy day ?
- I don't use any make-up, but do you think I can use some to shrink my eyes maybe ?
- For FAAB with curves, what do you wear without looking like a rapper of '90 to hide those curves ?

37,2016-07-22 12:56:55,4u2m9i,3,6,"I have no idea who I am. It all started some years back when I fell into a deep depression, which I'll talk about later.

A little about me: 

I am a 21 year old male. After the past few months, I am pretty sure I am gender fluid, or some form thereof.

When I was a kid, I always felt different from other guys. I was always more feminine than they were. I considered myself girly. I never thought I was a girl, I just thought that I wasn't male. I always played with dolls and liked girly stuff. For a long time, I never connected with my gender. I didn't want to be a boy or think I was a boy, I just didn't quite fit in. So I didn't identify as being a guy. I always thought my being sensitive, small, and not liking sports made me not worthy of calling myself a guy. 
When I got to college, I sorta started identifying as a girl. I started realizing that I couldnt develop my own sense of masculinity.

I entered a depression last semester. To summarize, a girl I liked said some really awful things to me and told me that a real man doesn't wear nice clothes or act gentlemanly to everyone or cook (all things that I do/like to do). Combined with other circumstances in my life, I feel into a depression. After that, I started questioning my sexual and gender identities.

I like women's fashion. I take an interest in what women wear, and like it when I see a well-dressed women. I also think men should have more variety in their wardrobe. To me, women have more variety.

For the past few months I've been wondering if I'm trans. And I have no idea. I have never felt uncomfortable having a penis, nor have I ever wanted breasts or a vagina. On the contrary, I liked going into puberty and seeing more body hair and a deeper voice. I went to an all guys school, and I never felt uncomfortable being there. But I've been hung up on the idea that maybe I am trans.
I have a sexual fetish for women's and men's clothes. Not for everything, mostly women's hosiery, heels, and men's shoes.

I don't mind having a penis, nor do I mind having facial or body hair. Actually, I quite like having facial and body hair.

I don't mind it when people see me as a man. I have thought about cross-dressing for sexual pleasure and because I want to look sexy.

I have a bit of an odd relationship with my appearance. I like how I look (sometimes). But I always picture myself looking different. I always picture myself as a different, better-looking man. But then I look and I'm not.

I identify with some women, and I naturally get alone better with them and prefer their company. Additionally, when I'm around women I feel most like a man.

Some other facts, I've freaked out and had breakdowns about other things. I had a period where I was afraid I was gay. My sister said I had homosexual OCD (HOCD). I once had an irrational and paranoid fear that I was going insane, when I was really just depressed. That being said, I wonder if my fear about being trans is just another one of those irrational fears I have.

I'm really skinny, and I've had issues finding clothes that fit me like I would like. I am also extremely self conscious. As a result, there isn't much variety in my wardrobe. I fear that this combined with my interest in women's fashion makes me trans.

I have some ""feminine"" characteristics. I'm submissive, eager to please, I'm emotionally sensitive, and I like serving people.
I've always identified as being more feminine, but I've always known logically I was a boy.

I've also seen myself as more masculine sometimes, as well.

Last but not least, I've always been curious as to what it's like to be a woman.

With all of that being said, what do you think I am? Am I trans and in denial? Or am I just a cis guy who doesn't fit? Or am I something else?

One of my earlierst memories was when I was in my first year of primary school and we were learning about wishes and the teacher asked everyone what they wished for... and I remember wishing to be a girl, and of course everyone laughed and I was embarassed but I never brought this up to anyone for a while. I also remember that my younger sister used to play with baby dolls and there were times when I wanted to play with them too, when I was maybe 7/8 and although my parents told me that I could do whatever I want (thankfully they're pretty supportive of whatever I do) I remember specifically not playing with them because something just felt wrong, or bad, by doing so. Years came and went and I remember having more signs growing up: I used to want to wear skirts and dresses, I would gravitate towards 'girls television' and prefer to hang out with the girls at school. When I went into high school a lot of the people I hung out with were the 'outcasts' and recently many of them have admitted to being gay or bi or not part of the 'norm.'

Well, a few months ago I started considering myself gender fluid, I knew I wanted to be a woman sometimes and hadn't given it much thought, but at the same time I considered myself a man. However, the other night I couldn't sleep at all, why? Because I just suddenly had this huge surge of emotions telling me that I wanted to be a female. That I wanted to come out to my friends and family, that I wanted to change everything about myself and put myself through surgery. That the only thing that had stopped these feelings in the past was the fact that I wanted to naturally have kids and I was worried about what people would think, but sperm could be frozen and I don't fucking care about what others think. I spent the next 24 hours just feeling this way. And today I feel like it all just stopped. I don't even know what the hell to feel anymore. Like, I've been putting all of those feelings from the other day out of my mind, I just want to think clearly, but I just don't know how to feel right now.

I've been thinking a lot lately, I'm almost 30, getting older, gaining weight as the metabolism shits itself, and I'm wondering about why I feel the way I do. As my breasts get more pronounced, and I am gaining even more hip mass, I'm getting pissed off!

I didn't want to jiggle today, damn you. Obey me! Literally an impossible request.

 I kindof need to vent/have someone who can relate? I've always had problems with my physical shape. Body dysmorphia, I was a very skinny child with no real alliance towards a sexual preference for the most part, and didn't really want to deal with puberty. I knew it was coming, and yet I was not happy about it. Let me be a 'person'.

It happened. I was pissed (lol, it's what the born female body does a good deal of the time...and yet I hated it). And every time the egg drops, I get pissed. It's not even that I want male genitalia. I think it'd be awesome, I'd love to experience that, but all the time? No. I want a choice.

Maybe pegged as 'person' first. Hot girl...when I feel like it.

I write roleplaying stories with people in scifi or fantasy situations. Not like 'der i hit u with a stick' more like '6k words later and we have a small novel'. Why? Because I want to be every goddamn variation of person. I don't want it static! It's maddening.

I know if I transitioned it's not the right fit, but I know staying where I am is not the right fit...either?

This makes it all-together so very confusing.

Pansexual and possibly gender-fluid. I never thought the latter was actually a 'thing' in my life. And yet it's a daily thing and I'm stupid for not really considering it.

 Today, I was feeling very 'dude'. Problem is, I'm extremely feminine looking. Like cute Christina Hendricks if the body was a bit more curvy. Like no. I don't want to do that today.

I have no interest in breast binding. I just don't want them to show up when I don't want them there. I also don't want to pretend to have a package. That's not how I want to be.

I've felt this way forever, but alas, I am a girl with dat hips and dat ass and dat cute girly face...what the shit can a girly girl do when she wants to, idk, present as male or even ????? sometimes?!

I don't even know how this shit works..My stomach fat is making me angry, my boobs are making me angry. 

When it comes to sexy times, I enjoy playing any and all roles and genders. The fact that I cannot fully be the role I want to at the given moment makes me livid...

The world was not made for people like me, it appears.

I am so confused, and so pissed off...
