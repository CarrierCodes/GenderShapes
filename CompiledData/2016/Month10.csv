I'm still new to learning terms so I hope I do not offend and this is the right place to post. By my understanding, nonbinary can be a broad term so I thought I'd try here.

I am AFAB? I was assigned female at birth and I am 23 years old. Already that makes me feel quite old in the community as I see amazing non binary young children discovering who they are but, I suppose that's their journey and not mine.

There are times in my life, I do not feel I identify as a woman. There are times where I will dress or attempt to dress more ""masculine"" (I put in quotes because definitions of these things are so fluid?). This is something I've done, or feel I have done for a few years now. I gradually started to wear less skirts and dresses, although I do now and then. To be honest, sometimes it makes me feel uncomfortable. I feel really exposed. 

And that's something I've noticed lately. Sometimes having breasts makes me feel uncomfortable. I was a smaller size a little while ago, experienced the same thing and it's worse now they're bigger. That is something I have experienced for as long as I can remember. They feel like two foreign objects on my chest that get in my way and I, for a moment, wish to take them off. But again, this is not 100% of the time.

I have in the past and recently had people refer to me using female pronouns (she/her). It makes me almost flinch, something feels off and I almost feel like they're not talking about me. I find also lately I'm trying to explore my gender expression so on days where I feel very disassociated with my birth gender, this irks me. Recently when my flatmate was having company, I subconsciously felt awkward because I was the only ""boy"". Referring to myself as such didn't feel off. 

I have a close group of male friends I formed over the years and there are social situations where they perhaps will almost feel the need to apologise for comments that women may find offensive. This also confuses me and feels unnecessary. 

I know a very common narrative amongst the trans* community is having strong feelings growing up. I know that I have for sure thought of a male name that I would go by. I also did wear a boy's top that my parents let me purchase (but I don't think that's a huge deal). 

I do enjoy wearing makeup, although I haven't for a while and recently it's just not been my thing. When I dress up and make an effort, so to speak, it feels off. It feels like I'm drawing attention to myself that I feel uncomfortable with. I have constantly battled to be body positive and love myself but I also have been diagnosed with body image distortions so that doesn't help.

I have also (just last night, for the first time) attempted to bind and tuck in the privacy of my home. I'm so so very curious. I did recently date someone else who is non binary and transitioning. I can't help but think that at first, I was researching to get a better understanding, to support. But here I am, still researching. I thought I wanted to be more like this person, that I was taking on too much of their personality. Could it be possible I am processing their transition for them or really it's just triggered a lot of repressed feelings I've had since I was younger.

I'm so confused, I feel emotional and so alone. I plan on potentially mentioning this to a doctor soon.

Hello I am VeggieBunnie,

I just want to share my story in hopes that it will help someone else along their journey. I'm 24 and for work classified as a female. How ever I'm non-binary and I'm so happy I can say that out loud.

Growing up I was a tomboy and it never really left the older I became. I just never felt like a girl and in later years never really felt like a boy either, I was just well me, and that’s how people saw me. That weirdo over there, and by the end of highschool I had come to accept it. I recall feeling pissed off and frustrated and getting into yelling matches for years with trying to explain to people that I'm not a girl. How ever puberty blessed me with curves and a very feminine body, that I hated for years. I went through the make up phase and all of it was inspired by David Bowie that man changed my life. I also would do my best to flatten my chest  so my boobs weren’t so apparent, and having large boobs that wasn’t the easiest thing to do. Over the years  I have come to love my body, and discovered I can be me regardless of what I look like now a days.

One summer in highschool I was watching the discovery channel about transgenders and how people felt trapped in there bodies. And I was like I feel trapped in my body, but I don’t want to change what I look like, maybe have smaller boobs but that’s it. My dad was convinced for years that I was going to be a boy. We have long since had that conversation and hes okay with me just being well me. This how ever never stopped me from leaning more toward masculine roles or just in my mind being in strong roles. I avoided dresses, and well all over girly clothing, because it made me feel so awkward. I did wear prom dresses and dresses for musicals but I knew I was playing so it didn’t bug me, I was confused to why it was actually fun. Then again I was always confused haha. I recall past boyfriends being like you need to wear this or that and then getting upset when I didn’t. I was completely confused, lost, and always pissed off at the world. Because how could no one understand what I was talking about?

It would always go well your not transgender so you should be happy with your body, well your not a boy because you have boobs and a vagina, your attracted to dudes, or blah blah blah. I would always end up in tears and sometimes very drunk It was really unhealthy. I had some shitty relationships and at some point i was like well maybe this was all stemmed from that, because i had read somewhere that people, sometimes will want to change their gender so the feel less vulnerable and wont get hurt again. But I was like nah because Ive felt like this for years. 
I went to college hoping to figure it out wrong, found my love for food though, and more hate and then depression. I had left a guy id been with for 3 years. Add that to all the other stuff and i was off in a bad way. It all came to a head when I stared playing around with make up and thinking well this is what society wants. I was miserable, all I knew is that I wasn’t a girl but i wasn’t a boy and no one believed me. I didn’t want to tell my parent because My brother had just came out of the closet and I didn’t want to over shadow him or make their lives even more confused.  Now looking back at it I wish I had try to join the LGBT club on campus, but I was also working 3 jobs so that may have been hard. However there is always more clubs to join. Fast forward a few years. I joined the military, best decision I have made so far. 

I was like will military manly it works, little did i know that it was going to be the changing point in my inner struggle. I was waiting to be sent to my duty station when a friend back home had sent me a video going ,i think you might like this. It was Ruby Roses transformation video. I watched it it put me in tears, i was like that’s it, I have no idea what its called but that’s it. So i looked up Ruby Rose and found out that she was non-binary. I just started reading articles, and books, because i had the time at the time. I was satisfied and felt really freed, it was the best birthday present I could have gotten that year. Only took 22 years for me to figure out what to call myself, and 2 years later I'm still making so many self-discoveries.

Now its not been rainbows and unicorns, but Ive never felt better. I even found a partner who really care about me for me. He thinks I’m a bit odd sometimes but really doesn’t question it, in all fairness he’s a bit odd too haha. There are days when ill dress like a girl and days ill dress like a boy that hasn’t changed. Well dressing like a girl has but I really only do it when I feel comfortable with it. He has told me I don’t care what you do has long as I don’t have to wear a dress. Fair is fair. I have also discovered Ruplaus drag race and im in love! I want to be a DIVA like them haha
I know I just rambled but I really hope this helps some one out oneday

My whole life, I've felt slightly uncomfortable with traditional ""girly"" things. I don't wear makeup, don't obsess over boys (I'm pansexual, by the way), and wear exclusively t-shirts and jeans. Basically, I'm what most people consider a tomboy.

But lately, I've started to realize that I hate being female and having a female body. Even though I have small breasts, I feel like I shouldn't have them at all. I don't want them. And having periods and a vagina just feels... wrong somehow. Like I shouldn't have them either. I'm also terrified of (and somewhat repulsed by) the idea that I might become pregnant someday.

I just never want either of those things to happen to me. I just... don't want to be female. It just feels wrong.

At the same time, though, I don't know how I would feel if I were to wake up in a male body tomorrow. I guess wouldn't be much better. I really don't know.

Mentally, I guess I would say I'm pretty androgynous. My brain seems like kind of a cross between the archetypal masculine and feminine personalities.

i spent my whole childhood obsessively thinking about how i wanted to be a girl, not a boy. when i reached adolescence it turned out i was attracted to girls; my focus shifted to attracting women more than wanting to be one. 

more recently i unearthed the childhood experience i'd more or less repressed, and i've been reexamining my gender identity with a lot of curiosity and openness. what i've discovered is that my experience with gender fluctuates though trends far more to the female side of the spectrum. i'd say that if gender were a scale from 1 (female) to 10 (male), most of my time is spent between the 2-5 range, with periodic experiences on the male side between 6-8.

as i write this, it seems obvious that i'm nonbinary, but something about the trans marker often feels more appropriate, as i do feel pretty female, at least a lot of the time, and have since a pretty young age.

I've been living with a childhood friend of mine for almost a year now. We are both male; he identifies as straight and I identify as bi. The thing is we both have feelings for each other but feel incompatible due to our genders, and he stated that the only thing he felt was in the way was the fact that I am a guy rather than a girl. The dynamic of our relationship is very unusual. We've known each other for 7 years, going on 8, and I've always felt really close to him and like I could trust him.

Please keep in mind I'm only speaking from a short term limited basis but I speak none the less.

Are you a ""tough"" person? Ask yourself before you start hormones ""how do I deal with my feelings?"" Hormones are gonna change you sister. Tough doesn't stand a chance against estrogen. However as you break down and pick yourself back up will be stronger, emotionally. 

Is your partner straight? Your partner may love and cherish you, hold you close and promise you they'll always be there but they may not be able to change the orientation they were born with any more then you are able to change how you were born. If they leave, get ready to greave like you have never grieved before. Tears will flow.

Are you ready to change? There are in fact some aspects of your personality that are gonna change as you transition more and more. Weather it be a reaction to your change in environmental response from coming out or your physiological presence slowly reforming, you will act some what different.

Your probably gonna ask your self over and over if your trans, wondering if this is right for you. I think it's normal and for the record I don't think a lot of CiS gendered people ask if they're CiS. I think most Transgender (that I've met) people have questioned hard if they're trans or not. 

It's up to you to educate your health care professionals. Come prepared with quantifiable data you can vet by peer reviewed sources. If they don't feel comfortable giving you care, challenge them. You deserve treatment.

There's probably more but I'm tired and emotionally exhausted. Please keep in mind I probably face less challenges then a lot of other girls. I live in western Canada. I just wanted to get this out in front of people who are starting HRT. It's a ride. Hold on.

I want to start off by saying that I have no ill intent in posting here, I'm just trying to start a little conversation to get a little bit from each of your points of view. If anything I say or ask comes off as rude or insensitive, please let me know.

I have a hard time buying into the concept of a gender identity. When it comes to sexual orientation, it makes sense to me that a human being can be inherently attracted to the opposite sex. Sex is a natural function and although homosexual sex is an evolutionary dead end, it makes perfect sense to me that a man can inherently be attracted to other men (and the same for women) without the influence of society affecting that feeling.

With a gender identity, however, you must first come to the conclusion that gender is a social construct, otherwise you'd be admitting the notion that gender is a natural state, which implies that there is a normal for gender (the normal being Man and Woman since those correspond with the two natural sexes). And if you say that Man and Woman are the natural states of gender, then you invalidate any idea that being transgender or nonbinary could be seen as a normal thing.

However, if you come to the conclusion that gender is a social construct then you must also come to the conclusion that being trans is not something you naturally are, but rather an idea that you got from deviating from society's norms of gender. The reason I bring this up is because there's so much struggle that comes along with being anything besides the two popular genders. Why assign yourself as a label like ""Transwoman"" when you could instead just be ""A person who's a male that happens to like things society deems feminine"". It seems to me that there's no reason for there to be as many labels as there are when it comes to gender, since gender is a totally fabricated idea to begin with.

I am in no way male-identified, not on T with no plans to ever start, and my insurance is covering 80% of the $34,000 surgery (I won't be paying the entire $6,800 as I will have met my deductible by then). For those curious, my surgeon is Dr. Hansen at OHSU in Portland, and I am having double incision with nipple grafts. From start to (near) finish, all the care I have received from OHSU has been top-notch. 

I'm most worried about how uncomfortable I'll be the first week -- anesthesia makes me throw up, opioids make me dizzy. Also, stinky until drains come out after that week. I've heard a bit of witch hazel on a cotton ball is preferable to baby wipes, which contain oil, to wipe underarms and face for a bit of refreshment. Laxatives to counteract the constipating effect of the pain meds, a U-shaped neck pillow to make back-sleeping more tolerable, plenty of reading material and movies, and two solid weeks of no commitments are all things I've acquired.

I'm AMAB and am coming to terms that I am not 100% cis male. I also don't think I'm 100% trans female either - for now at least, I've been identifying as NB/genderqueer. I do know, however, that I identify more on the femme end of the spectrum and have been consciously working on incorporating more femmeness into my gender presentation. I'm currently in short-term counseling to talk through my gender identity and I've already spoken to a doctor and signed an informed consent form, so no gatekeeping and I'm good to go as soon as I decide.

Of course I understand that HRT is an intensely personal decision, I've done plenty of research on the effects of HRT, I know that going on HRT/not going on HRT is not a measure of how legitimately trans or NB someone is, etc. But I think it would be helpful to hear how others - who identify as NB or genderqueer, and not necessarily as trans - made the decision to start HRT (or, on the other hand, how you decided *not* to go on HRT).

30,2016-10-08 00:42:53,56emef,2,3,"Hi all!

It’s been a while since I last wrote here, so let me catch you up on my story – skip the next paragraph if you want to.

I have always felt I’m different than people around me, but as I grew up in a conservative environment it was kind of a no-no to even read about LGBTQ stuff. I started university in 2013, became atheist in 2014. August 2015, that’s when I found a vlog by an openly gender fluid person. That video lead to a website, a forum, a blog post and after 24 hours without so much as a bathroom break I knew I’m anything but a straight cis male. I started to explore who I am, play with cloths and makeup – first in my room, then I started to open up to close friends. Through my university I got a therapist in January 2016 and worked through issues from past and present. 

I made progress quick, in April 2016 (on my birthday) I came out publicly as gender fluid / non-binary / gender queer. I love skirts, eye makeup, cute shoes and colourful shirts. I’m happier now then I was ever before. And I think that I should move on to the next step in my journey, and seriously consider HRT.

The first problem is that while I do want to be more feminine (and tbh I would really love to have at least small breasts), I don’t identify as a (tans)woman, and I probably never will. I’m afraid that my position can be misunderstood for being ‘unsure about being a trans-woman’ rather than a non-binary individual who feels on the feminine side of the spectrum. It worries me that this could delay the process needlessly by months, years or even straight out prohibit me from getting HRT.

The other thing is that through laziness and not knowing what or how to do, I’m not currently registered with any local GP (I believe a GP local to my parents still has my details but it’s been over 3 years since I’ve lived there). As I’m still as student with not much income to speak of I would want to go through NHS and minimise costs as much as possible.

I know there are a few clinics in area taking in new patients, but naturally as they are all staffed with general practitioners only, LGBTQ, let alone NB, issues are not really advertised front right and centre. Should I just call all of them up and ask if they accept non-binary patients? How much do I reveal in that initial contact? And what to say during the first check up all new patients are supposed to go through? When do I have the gender identity and the HRT conversations?

The last 6 months of my life have been extremely stressful. My father, to whom I have been very close for the better portion of my life, was diagnosed with dementia. As a result of this year of tension between myself and my Mother boiled over and now are relationship is pretty much destroyed. She is an overbearing, controlling person (to put it mildy) and after years of her saying and doing awful things to me I cut her out of my life. Unfortunately due to her being my father's primary care giver it means I don't get to see him either.

This recent family strife coupled with a string of toxic relationships and a stressful job have lead to a period of poor mental health. Especially in the last 2 months. During this period I have found myself asking the question ""who am I"" a lot and I've been having somewhat of an identity crisis. 

Obviously when you are having feelings like this it is only natural to begin to question things like sexuality and gender. As regards my sexuality I'm nearly 100% sure I'm a straight male. In my early 20's I thought I might have been bisexual but through experimentation confirmed that I have no sexual attraction to men. Also I have never felt the desire to dress or live as a woman. This issue I'm having seems ""different"".

I am now finding it close to impossible to identify as being male. I don't know when it happened for sure but despite the fact that I am a guy with a shaved head, a beard and athletic build, I feel the label male doesn't fit me as a person. 

On the flipside of this I noticed that I am more comfortable around women in general. This could be down to the fact that I have 5 sisters and a lot of close female friends but if I had to chose between hanging out with men or women in a social situation I would always choose women. 

Notwithstanding that point, I don't want to be a woman because again I don't think being female would fit my identity either.

So can anybody help me? Is there a word for a person who was born male, finds women attractive but doesn't identify as being either male or female? 

A bit of guidance would go a long way because this is driving me crazy and not knowing is deeply upsetting.

(I\'m a middle-class, white academic who lives in California and whose friends are all liberal-Democrat-or-better.)\n\nHas anyone else felt like this?

54,2016-10-13 02:02:02,577x5g,0,2,"First off, thanks for taking the time to read this. Secondly, I don't want to offend anyone because I realize many people struggle with their gender identity and where they feel they fit in society.

I'm a 27 year old male. I truly don't know if gender exists. I do not like labels in any facet of life,

I mostly fit the ""man"" label for my entire life. While I was not overtly masculine and fairly introspective and introverted, I am good at sports and once I was over a lot of my self esteem issues, pretty good with ladies.

I've actually found myself wishing I was more masculine growing up. Especially after watching porn growing up, I wanted a larger penis and more strength. I wanted to be dominant. But I found my self being averagely strong, thin wristed, slightly passive, slightly submissive and averagely endowed.

I feel that sexually, I am not what I want to be... But, when I live my life, without thinking, without indulging bad habits, I have a high sex drive and I'm quite dominant. I've never been with a male. I've been with a handful of females.

When I accepted that I can't really get a larger penis, I can't increase my overall size that much and whatnot, I started to want to go to the other end of the spectrum. This was pretty early on, like mid-teens.

I started looking at the females in porn and imagining having a vagina and being penetrated.

I imagined being taken, used, and doing sex acts for and to men. I created craigslists ads for men, but never acted on them (which I'm glad about).


At about 14, I tried my mothers lingerie on. I did is a handful of other times. I felt so TINGLY. It was a very good feeling. Blissful. I came twice, just by having them on and had to take them off very quickly.


I tried a former partners panties on a few times too. I had similar tingly feelings. I've never owned my own, but I'm thinking about some purchases.

I do see a connection between my porn viewing and these thoughts/feelings though. I'm vowing right now to stop the porn. I've stopped in the past, and naturally became a little more masculine and attracted more ladies.

But, I've been drawn back in the past. I know it's easy to stop and I'm now vowing to do so.

But, I'd be lying if the idea of having some clothes and makeup didn't sound e ticking and fun. And I feel like maybe I was drawn to the porn for a reason. I watch a specific kind, at times, and that is ""sissy hypno."" But I much prefer it to not use the words sissy or any homosexual slurs. I'd rather it be centered around my inner woman and inner ""slut.""

Lately I've been visualizing some some unisex clothing, maybe slightly leaning toward girly, and some makeup. I've been wanting to go out, maybe to a club, with a girl or an open minded guy.


Even if the feelings remain, I don't think the porn is a healthy way to explore them. I also worry that these feelings are spawned from a low self esteem and lack of confidence in my penis size (about 6.25 and sort of thin).

Does anyone else have similar experiences? Do you think I should wait a few weeks without porn to buy some clothes? Is there a cheap and discreet way to get clothes and makeup online? Does eyeliner, blush, mascara, and lipstick come off easily and quickly?

I will gladly accept any and all advice.

I just really like reading about other people's experience with gender, and would love for some people here to answer these questions as well. :)

SO, here are the questions, feel free to answer only the ones you want/ are comfortable answering:

1. How do you self-identify your gender, and what does that definition mean to you?

2. What pronouns do you use?

3. Describe the style of clothing that you most often wear.

4. Talk about your choices with body hair. How do you style your hair? Do you have facial hair? What do 
you choose to shave, or choose not to shave?

5. Talk about cosmetics. Do you choose to wear makeup? Do you paint your nails? What types of soaps and perfumes do you use, if any?

6. Have you experienced being misgendered? If so, how often?

7. Do you experience dysphoria? How does that affect you?

8. Talk about children. Are you interested in having children? Would you want to carry a child if that were an option for you? Do you want to be the primary caretaker for any children you may have?

9. Talk about money. Is it important to you to provide for a family financially if you choose to have one? Is it important to you that you earn more than any partner you may have? Do you prefer to pay for things like dates? Are you uncomfortable when others pay for you or offer to pay for you?

I'm 17 now and have had more girlfriends than boyfriends, I have no true clue what my sexuality is and I'm confused about my gender. I'm a girl, but I've always worn more masculine clothes and I've started being really nervous about letting my chest be noticeable, even though I used to be really showy about it when I had crushes on people. I've always hated the fact that I had a period and it's always made me feel super uncomfortable talking about anything sexual until I had my first long term boyfriend and it took me over 6 months to even talk to him about anything like really feminine or anything like that and when I was with him I really changed. He had a lot of masculinity problems and he wanted to feel strong and manly so I was more submissive and feminine and I'm just talking about in our over all relationship. When we first started dating I wore a dress once for a really stupid dare, and by the time our relationship was ending I wore skirts and dresses almost every week. When I was growing up I also really wanted short hair like a boy but my dad always told me no and said, ""you'll look like a dyke"" and stuff, but he finally let me get it pretty short, but only because my mom cut it for me. I just don't know what I'm doing I feel like I'd be more comfortable without conforming specifically as a girl but being a guy is really big and scary and my whole family is so transphobic.

I\'ve always hated the fact that I had a period and it\'s always made me feel super uncomfortable talking about anything sexual until I had my first long term boyfriend and it took me over 6 months to even talk to him about anything like really feminine or anything like that and when I was with him I really changed. He had a lot of masculinity problems and he wanted to feel strong and manly so I was more submissive and feminine and I\'m just talking about in our over all relationship. When we first started dating I wore a dress once for a really stupid dare, and by the time our relationship was ending I wore skirts and dresses almost every week.

I'm AFAB nonbinary and I have top surgery coming up in less than three months (omgomogmogmomgomg). I'm not on T. 

Here's what I (will) look like: 
AFAB hips, hairy pits, longish hair, top surgery scars, swim shorts (not trunks)

Does anyone have experience going out in public (YMCA) swimming like that? I don't want to get kicked out for being a topless woman, but I also feel uncomfortable and stupid wearing a women's swim suit for no reason.

I'm in Austin, TX, fwiw. 

I plan on asking other Austin NB folks, my former swim coach (cis woman) who is also a lifeguard/pool manager, and possibly the mgmt at the Y.

83,2016-10-18 16:48:47,584umb,9,13,"I was born female and I'm happy in my body. It is what it is. When I was a kid, I always wanted to be a boy. I dressed like a boy, I played with boys, I hated that I couldn't be a boy scout and I thought girls had cooties. I stopped letting people put me into dresses when I was five. It happened on a couple of occasions after that but it was incredibly rare for many years until I started doing it voluntarily (still incredibly rare). I was a hot wheels, legos, scabby knee kid.

Starting around 6/7 I played lots of ""I'll show you mine if you show me yours"" games. I wanted a penis so bad. I loved watching boys pee and I would try to pee standing up. Some boys would let me touch them. I loved exploring. They loved exploring my body too, of course. With one boy (8?) we would have what we called ""kid sex"" where basically we just got naked and grinded under the covers since we didn't know what we were doing. He was erect for sure though. It was glorious. 

My dad remarried and I got a little step-brother. We loved and hated eachother. Before he moved in with us I remember visiting him at his house (also around 8) and we were playing in his room. I don't remember how it happened but he ended up standing naked in the closet while I dusted him with a feather duster. I was ""cleaning"" him.

As we got older we did more. I was always the initiator but I didn't understand the depth of the wrongness (just that it was bad because grownups said so). I fooled around with lots of boys. Not really with them, persay... I just wanted to touch their penises. To make them hard and make them feel good. Even when I was little boys seemed to like it and I LOVED it. I was so jealous but so happy to touch it.

Various women in my life would try to put me in touch with my feminine side. They would buy me clothes and they always went unworn after a while. I felt bad but it just wasn't me. They told me I would get boobs. I hated them. In sixth grade I cut all my hair off. I played hockey in middle school and high school. I had mohawks and wore long dickies shorts and band shirts. 

I'd learned to masturbate earlier by rubbing on things but when I learned that I could do it with my hands I started looking at porn. I guess it was right around the same time that I got a good computer in my bedroom again. I like artistic drawings of the male form. Erect or flaccid it didn't matter.

I started reading erotica but preferred ""solotouch.com"" and reading stories about boys (the closer to my age, the better) pleasuring themselves or each other. Often they were recollections written by older men. Every once in a while I would read stories written by women but they didn't do it for me. I would learn something maybe about how to touch myself better but then go back to reading m-m stories. 

I'm 25. I dress modestly most of the time but I have a nice feminine form. I wear clothes that are designed for women's shapes but are ideally men's styles. Long shorts, cargo pockets, plaid button up shirts, etc. I don't wear makeup and for the past ten years my hair was long and straight and simple brown. I'll sometimes wear a dress for special occasions and I floor people. 

I kissed a girl once in high school and was revolted. She was bi and it was a dare and I gave it my best shot but it wasn't for me. I've had several LTRs and a couple dozen hookups or short relationships. I love guys. I'm more comfortable with my body now (I've always been fairly neutral and passive) and I hope to be a mother someday. 

I also really imagine myself having a penis like... all the time. I watch porn of guys pleasuring themselves. I watch gay blowjob porn. I don't watch porn with girls in it. My favorite is POV fleshlight fucking. I don't like seeing women get fucked and I don't really like watching guys get fucked either. 

I don't feel intensely enough to want to change my gender (like I said, I'd like to be a mother someday!) but I did when I was a kid. The men in my life have greatly benefited from my abnormally high fascination with the male anatomy and it makes me happy to be able to provide such pleasure. 

I've never really identified as a woman though, even though I've tried. This summer I went through a really terrible breakup among other things and chopped all my hair off. I spike it in the front like a 7th grade boy and I love it. Everyone else loves it too and I feel so good to be me!

I just want I guess a better understanding of what kind of identity me really is? I have some psychological problems and I'm trying to label those as well, but I feel like labeling my gender identity is also important.

I don\'t remember how it happened but he ended up standing naked in the closet while I dusted him with a feather duster. I was ""cleaning"" him.\n\nAs we got older we did more. I was always the initiator but I didn\'t understand the depth of the wrongness (just that it was bad because grownups said so). I fooled around with lots of boys. Not really with them, persay... I just wanted to touch their penises. To make them hard and make them feel good. Even when I was little boys seemed to like it and I LOVED it. I was so jealous but so happy to touch it.\n\nVarious women in my life would try to put me in touch with my feminine side. They would buy me clothes and they always went unworn after a while. I felt bad but it just wasn\'t me. They told me I would get boobs. I hated them. In sixth grade I cut all my hair off. I played hockey in middle school and high school. I had mohawks and wore long dickies shorts and band shirts. \n\nI\'d learned to masturbate earlier by rubbing on things but when I learned that I could do it with my hands I started looking at porn. I guess it was right around the same time that I got a good computer in my bedroom again. I like artistic drawings of the male form. Erect or flaccid it didn\'t matter.\n\nI started reading erotica but preferred ""solotouch.com"" and reading stories about boys (the closer to my age, the better) pleasuring themselves or each other. Often they were recollections written by older men. Every once in a while I would read stories written by women but they didn\'t do it for me. I would learn something maybe about how to touch myself better but then go back to reading m-m stories. \n\nI\'m 25. I dress modestly most of the time but I have a nice feminine form. I wear clothes that are designed for women\'s shapes but are ideally men\'s styles. Long shorts, cargo pockets, plaid button up shirts, etc. I don\'t wear makeup and for the past ten years my hair was long and straight and simple brown. I\'ll sometimes wear a dress for special occasions and I floor people. \n\nI kissed a girl once in high school and was revolted. She was bi and it was a dare and I gave it my best shot but it wasn\'t for me. I\'ve had several LTRs and a couple dozen hookups or short relationships. I love guys. I\'m more comfortable with my body now (I\'ve always been fairly neutral and passive) and I hope to be a mother someday. \n\nI also really imagine myself having a penis like... all the time. I watch porn of guys pleasuring themselves. I watch gay blowjob porn. I don\'t watch porn with girls in it. My favorite is POV fleshlight fucking. I don\'t like seeing women get fucked and I don\'t really like watching guys get fucked either. \n\nI don\'t feel intensely enough to want to change my gender (like I said, I\'d like to be a mother someday!) but I did when I was a kid. The men in my life have greatly benefited from my abnormally high fascination with the male anatomy and it makes me happy to be able to provide such pleasure. \n\nI\'ve never really identified as a woman though, even though I\'ve tried. This summer I went through a really terrible breakup among other things and chopped all my hair off. I spike it in the front like a 7th grade boy and I love it. Everyone else loves it too and I feel so good to be me!\n\nI just want I guess a better understanding of what kind of identity me really is? I have some psychological problems and I\'m trying to label those as well, but I feel like labeling my gender identity is also important.\n\nMy best guess right now is that I\'m androsexual?

Anyways, I'm afab but I sort of don't feel like a girl. I like to hang out with guys, wear masculine clothing, and play sports with boys. Most of the people at my school don't really see me as a girl, so I feel uncomfortable going to the girl locker room. I haven't gone in there for two years. Also whenever I wear typically feminine clothing, like the one time I wore a dress for an orchestra concert, people laughed at me and said things that sort of hurt my feelings. 

The thing is, for a while I identified as a demigirl. This was because I felt sort of like a girl and then sort of not like a girl. But for a few months now this has been bothering me. I don't really want a girl body but I don't want to be a boy. I want to be mostly masculine but sort of a girl? I don't really know how to describe it. I don't want to really have a chest or curves or things like that, but I don't want male genitals. This is confusing.

So recently I've thought about identifying as a demiboy, because I feel sort of 75% masculine and then 20~% female. Is this okay? Well, is this heading in the right direction? I also don't want to label myself this to be a special snowflake, it's just that I'm somewhere in the middle of being a girl and being a boy, but leaning towards boy? I'm confused.

Also the demigender subreddits aren't really populated. I literally found like 3 active people on them. So I came here.

TL;DR: Pretty much I have a girl body, but on a spectrum of male-female I'm in the middle leaning towards male? So am I a demiboy? I think so? Help meh pls?

The legislation which sparked this issue in Canada is bill C-16:
&gt;The enactment also amends the Criminal Code to extend the protection against hate propaganda set out in that Act to any section of the public that is distinguished by **gender identity or expression** and to clearly set out that evidence that an offence was motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on **gender identity or expression** constitutes an aggravating circumstance that a court must take into consideration when it imposes a sentence.

Dr. Peterson is claiming that the new provisions would make using the wrong pronoun on a person an offence which could be punishable, and would therefore constitute an enforcement of correct speech which for to him and many others seems abhorrent. The university administration who was pressuring Dr. Peterson to stop earlier has actually relented and accepted to hold a debate on the matter in order to discuss the nuances of gender determination, pronoun usage, free speech and legislation relating to it. 
I really hope that this goes over well and presents both sides of the arguments sufficiently since it's impact could be significant. As he mentioned in his [previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmNKPL1Y4g0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1485) it could be setting the standard and direction for many other educational facilities in the world.

138,2016-10-28 19:46:19,59wiqf,18,21,"Being diagnosed with autism in my youth, I (AFAB) was put into a special ed setting which was a predominantly male environment. There were a few other girls there but they did not have similar diagnoses to mine. I didn't fit in with the autistic boys and associated masculinity with mischief. 

Growing up I knew that there were masculine women, feminine men, and I accepted the existence of both. However as I got older it became apparent that despite taking behavioral therapies, I understood neither men's or women's ingroup-outgroup behavior. 

There were tomboys, which are women who understand and fit in with male groups, and adopt male habits. However my lack of a fit with the gender binary isn't really due to this. 

As we go into our 30s I have noticed that there is more of a societal emphasis on gender and its roles. Marriage and kids become a salient concern for many people while people with mental differences are sometimes stuck in the late teens / early 20s realm of psychosocial development. 

As a child I didn't play with Barbie or GI Joe extensively. I played computer games in the DOS os. When other students read gendered young adult fiction, I gravitated toward nonfiction that didn't discuss gender. I identified my personal image with gender neutral items such as the Troll dolls. 

When other students were developing their gender identities through gendered musical genres, I listened to largely nongendered, nonsexual music until relatively recently.  

Sometime in my teens or 20s, I became invested in femininity by realizing that it meant that I would not be forced into toxic masculinity. Because I only really started actively identifying femininely so that I would not be made to mature into contact sports and violence. 

I noticed that both men and masculine women are made to ""grow up"" into such people so I started presenting more femme, for self protection. Also, neurodiverse people who appear masculine face more police violence than those who appear feminine. 

When an autistic man, especially a tall autistic man, has a meltdown it is viewed as a threat to safety due to men being perceived as having more agency. More childhood dxed AMAB autistic people take major tranquilizers or have psychiatric histories than childhood diagnosed AFABs. 

I still play with stuffed animals but this stands alone. My masculine and feminine interests both kind of cohere with each other rather than with masculinity qua masculinity, or femininity qua femininity. 

For the most part, I have defined femininity - for myself - as a rejection of what I viewed as the aspects of masculinity I don't like. 

The aspects of masculinity I don't like are martial things: combat sports, wargames, testing social limits through dominance and unpredictable behavior. I am uncomfortable with the drama and volatility of day-trading, but my portfolio contains risky, non-ordinary investments such as peer-to-peer lending. 

However, my femininity is also ambiguous: I form friendship networks in a masculine-typical manner of having multiple friends groups around various special-interest nuclei, without many close friends. I cook and clean to optimize my well-being - I enjoy children because I have child-like interests. 

Yet because femininity is the marked category, I felt more comfortable identifying as such despite not fully fitting into either group.

It went well. She asked me about my history and all that stuff. She gave me three book recommendations and wants me to write a two-to-five page autobio about my struggles with my identity (which sounds tedious, but I love writing so it's no big deal to me).

But today I'm visiting my family and it just feels like they don't make enough effort. They do make an effort and I ""appreciate"" that in as far as you can appreciate someone doing something that they should automatically be doing anyway (I know this comes off as entitled, but I just feel like if I ask politely, don't get annoyed when they slip up and patiently wait for everyone to remember, people should at least be making my feelings somewhat of a priority). 
Sometimes I feel differently. Sometimes I can deal with things and I feel a lot more sympathetic with people. I know that it's difficult for some people to remember pronouns, when obviously they've been heavily conditioned in the opposite way. If I was in their position, I would find it hard too. If I'd never heard of trans people before and I had no experience of it, maybe I'd struggle a bit too. But today I feel really sad and I just want people to stop calling me she. It hurts.
Today I feel like my asking for people not to call me she is like someone asking not to be called Joey when they prefer Joseph. If people just KEEP calling them Joey, is that just okay? Is that ""oh sorry, I forget easily"" or is it ""come on now, can you please just respect what I've asked? I'm not asking for much"" I can't tell! I can't make up my mind whether to be sympathetic or pissed off lol.

I've been on T for almost 8 months and I can now pass as male. Strangers don't question me anymore and in the town where I live (away from my family), I live a comfortable and confident life. My ID says male, my name is legally changed, the law now recognises me as male and yet my family are so casual about it. If I try to talk to them about it, all I get is ""well you can't expect us to remember ALL the time"" as if it's some chore, as if I'm expecting way too much. I get this vibe of ""We humour you enough, don't we?"" and ""well if you decide to go and be a freak, you have to expect people to not take you seriously"" lol. It's not like these things are said, but I feel them. I can't be bothered anymore, you guys. I love my family, but they're so ignorant. It makes me not want to visit them. I came out to them a year and a half ago. Before then, I was happy to be around them. I felt like I could contribute to conversations and I had good bonds with everyone. Now I just avoid talking, because I know if I talk they'll use the wrong pronouns and name and it'll just get me down. So I'd rather not talk at all. 
Plus it's so embarrassing sometimes. Today one of my family members called me she in front of a cashier and the cashier was really confused because there were no women there. I don't look or sound like a woman anymore. I was embarrassed, I hated it so much. 

Sometimes I just feel pissed off. It feels like we have to ask for permission from EVERYONE, to be ourselves. ""Oh please can I have some HRT? No problem, I'll wait 3 years. Please can I change my name? Please can you remember my pronouns? No? Okay, I'll just wait a few more years then, no problem. Am I allowed to use this toilet? No, oh okay I'm sorry. I'll just piss where you tell me to then. Oh, I can't go into either bathroom? Okie doke, I'll just piss my pants or something, I'll figure it out, I deserve it for being different"" lol. Ahhh.

149,2016-10-31 08:45:53,5ab7vt,17,15,"I'm genderqueer, and I've never had anything which could be termed an ""internal sense of gender"", which many people describe as being at the core of what gender identity is. I have a lot of feelings about things that are gendered (which often shift day to day), but they don't form anything coherent enough to describe as an overall internal sense of my gender. Some examples of these feelings:

* Breasts - shifts from ""meh"" to ""I love them!"" (I'm AMAB but have gynecomastia)
* Penis - shifts from ""meh"" to ""what is this thing and why the hell is it attached to my body?""  (except during sex - then it's great)
* Body hair - ""meh"" to ""I want to shave this all off""
* Deep voice - love it
* Beard - love it
* Preferred clothing - neutral to feminine

I'm not at all sure how these things fit together into an overall feeling of gender (if that fitting together is even what happens to people with such a feeling), they seem to me like fairly separate aspects of my personality and my relationship to my body.

So, my question is: can anyone describe to me what gender identity *feels* like? Is it a fitting together of different aspects into something coherent? Or a separate sensation, like feeling hot or cold? Or something else entirely? I realise that this is a really difficult, and individual, question to answer, but I'd be grateful for any analogies, descriptions etc. no matter how imperfect.

Thanks!

14,2016-10-11 16:48:13,56yzbx,12,10,"I'd like to start by saying I definitely posted here about a month ago and I'm super grateful for the support that I have had. 

So I've been making a conscious effort to educate myself on identities, terms etc. I had been watching a lot of videos made by transgendered males over the past few months anyways. Videos on how to know you're transgender, if you're not etc. The initial process has been anxiety inducing for obvious reasons but I think I had a moment of clarity last night.

It's by my understanding that trans men see themselves as men but feel their body isn't quite right. They feel they should be seeing a ""man's body"" but what they see doesn't reflect that. I think what got me was that I can relate to this. 

Something I definitely do now I'm questioning/newly identifying is to try and look at myself in the mirror but I also try and picture my body as a man's. But it's incredibly hard because obviously that's technically different from what I'm seeing. 

There are times when I see my body and think, it looks so much like a woman's. It's too feminine and it feels off. I can't describe it. I believe this might be gender dysphoria? I'm not sure. I have been diagnosed with body image distortions by a therapist in terms of my size as it is. I also feel a pang when I am addressed as terms such as 'lady', 'miss', 'madam' or 'she'. It feels almost as if I'm being insulted in a weird way?

So I'm trying to experiment. I know what name I would go by when presenting as a male (although I don't mind being called that or my birth name) and that I know I have the desperate urge to dress more masculine. I am of course both nervous and scared because I've always been a bit of a tomboy since my late teens but now this is another level as I will be hoping to bind. I hear this is also deemed as transitioning too?

I've tried to wear things that hide my figure more and I instantly feel more comfortable. For a long time I thought I suffered from self esteem issues but I'm wondering if it's actually been gender dysphoria. The constant awareness that I have a very feminine looking figure.

I've tried to answer the question of ""if I could choose to wake up the next day as the opposite gender, would I?"". I think the answer is yes. If that meant I was 100% happy within myself and stopped questioning my gender identity and expression, then yes. I would be male. But then there'd be drawbacks in terms of having the dysphoria again of wanting the option to bear children.

So I hope you can see why I'm conflicted. I was wondering if genderfluid/nonbinary people do transition? If so, how do you decide what is enough to stop the dysphoria for the gender you feel, if you feel more than one? Any personal experiences would also be great to hear!

My adam's apple has gotten more prominent from T and while at first I liked it, now it's making me nervous. I can't tell if it's a dysphoria thing or the standard ""no one will like me if I'm a he/she-looking freak"" feeling. That really gets to me considering I was really androgynous most of my childhood and then went through a super femme presenting phase and I can't help but be aware of the fact that people seemed to like me more when I was en femme.

But I do wish my adam's apple were less prominent. To be fair, it was already pretty prominent for an AFAB person pre-T. And it's not enough for me to want to stop T because I like the way T makes me feel, I like getting random boners and not being so quick to tear up and being as physically strong as I always thought I was (which has gotten me into trouble in the past). I like that my face is more hollowed out. I like cumming like a guy. I like the way my chest looks and I like my growing happy trail. I like my voice so much more now (though I've been practicing my girlmode vs. boymode voices now that I actually have the range for both). 

But my adam's apple makes me really self-conscious. And my hair (or lack thereof) makes me really self-conscious too. I used to have pretty long (for a male-presenting person) bleached-blond hair, but I tried to cut it myself and it looked so stupid that I had to buzz it all. And I kind of want to shave my legs, but feel like I ""can't"" because I'm supposed to be masculine. I want to wear skirts and makeup and feel ashamed of that because it's like I'm betraying my transness somehow.

I can tell I've internalized a lot of the shitty things people have said about me and NB people because sometimes when I'm in boymode I feel like I must just be a trans guy who feels guilty for betraying women and is trying to cling to his past, and sometimes in girlmode I feel like I'm just a cis girl who's fooled herself into thinking she's trans because of body issues or because she wanted to jump on the transwagon.

Previously I was on Effexor (both pre-T and after starting it) and didn't really have this problem. [Side note: I first identified as genderfluid when I discovered the term at age 12 or so, and am 20 now, and before that I thought I had a ""half boy, half girl brain"", and because I had a vanishing twin in the womb I wondered whether I was a boy/girl chimera, and I expressed a desire for puberty blockers at age 10 before I even knew what they were, so this is not at all an ambiguous case of genderfluidity.]

When I was first starting puberty I also used to have more dramatic shifts, but as I got older they mellowed out and I've largely felt ""somewhere in the middle"", kind of wavering between masc- and femme-leaning modes. For the months leading up to testosterone I felt so steadily male-leaning with only occasional fluctuation (and it didn't really feel so much as going back to ""female"" as just not being particularly male... so agender/neutral days I guess) that I began to wonder whether I was just a gender nonconforming trans guy in denial.

Which brings me to a few weeks ago, when I started my new meds. The flipping is out of control. I have gone from feeling almost totally female and confused and questioning whether this means I have to detransition and if I'm suddenly going to be a girl forever now to back to male, dysphoria and all, and feeling like I'm clearly just a binary trans guy in denial who just feels too guilty about being male/is too much of a pussy to transition and that I should go on full-dose testosterone so I can get the full effects. I ended up halving my usual dose of T when I entered girlmode out of fear and then when I swung back into guymode I regretted it because I already have dysphoria about being soft and skinny and I felt like I had shot myself in the foot by halving it.

And, even more confusingly, I have found myself experiencing a significant amount of ""mixed"" states-- not the more comfortable, in the middle feeling I used to have, but a clear sense of being BOTH male and female at the same time and feeling distressed about being trapped in a body that can only do one thing and feeling like each side just wants to kill the other so I can just be one thing and be in peace.

This is killing me. Could it be the medication? Or is it just normal fluctuations in gender and dysphoria that's being made worse by depression/loneliness/shitty self-esteem?

I'd like to think that I'm a very open and accepting person when it comes to the way people want to define themselves.

I have, for a number of years, been supportive of a close friend that's redefined they're whole identity.  Gender identity wasn't the only change, but it was a big part of it.  They've also gone through so many changes on how they expect everyone to conduct themselves around them and how they expect to be treated.  It's been exhausting, to say the least, in rewiring myself to think in the ways that this person fells the most comfortable.

Within the last year, they went through a legal name change to redefine that part of their life (while also trying to run/hide from people in their 'former life').  Only a few of us in their life have been lucky enough to survive this 'purge and redefine' as they continue to shape a new life in a new city and home and everything.

The name change was something that I thought would be the hardest thing to get used to, since they've always been X to me, but want to be called Y now.  Again, it was mentally and emotionally exhausting to deal with, but I managed to make the change in my life and speech to accommodate.

Then, just a week ago, they stated to mention how they have been getting increasingly angry and frustrated at everyone calling them a particular pronoun.  They said that they want to change their pronoun to be what I've been using in this post so far to describe them.  That one statement made me freeze in a sort of angry fear.

38,2016-10-27 05:43:41,59mfsk,17,10,"In a nutshell, it's much easier said than done.  I'm at the point in my life at the ripe old age of 35 to where I have accepted that I am very much gender fluid and non binary.  Even so, I feel that there are number of blockers in my life, some real and some thrown up by my subconscious, that keep me from living a fully authentic life.  There's also some questions about how I would ideally envision my own body in terms of gender.

So the big one is dating and relationships.  The best way to identify sexually for me is ""queer heterosexual"" since I'm attracted to cis women, post op trans women, and DFAB gender fluid types, but I'm clearly not a run of the mill straight dude.  I want to be able be my full authentic self when I'm ""in the market"" or if I'm partnered, but it feels like dating and relationships can be a volatile shit show at times.  I feel like I have be more butch than I am authentically am in order to attract a partner.  If I meet someone while presenting more masculine, I know there will be the ""day of reckoning"" when I come out, which makes me want to overachieve in some ways to show my best possible qualities that don't necessarily have to do with gender.  If I meet someone while presenting more andro or femme, I always wonder if any attraction will be carried on, they are treating me as some kind of joke, etc.  I know a lot of it is me, and it also has a lot to do with looking for love, sex, and relationships in the wrong places.  I would love to hear from other AMABs, as well as female (bodied) partners of AMABs how they've found and met each other.

The second big blocker is professional.  In saying this, I am in the IT industry in Seattle, so I am fortunate enough to be in a fairly progressive environment overall.  It still doesn't make it easy though.  I want to be able to be my more authentic self on the job rather than presenting as ""masculine enough to where people don't ask many questions"".  But I have a morbid, and at times seemingly rational, fear that coming out and presenting more andro to femme at work can bring a slew of problems.  I somehow know that day will eventually come, and much like how I go about dating when I met someone when presenting as more masculine, I find myself striving to be damn good at what I do, because I know that if shit hits the fan because of gender issues, I have that as a defense.  But if any other AMAB has been able to do a non binary transition or be their more authentic self on the job with (mostly) positive results, once again, I want to hear their tips and tricks.  That said, you don't have to have a ""Cinderella"" story for me to think you've done well.

The last is about my body, and a possible non binary transition of sorts.  I don't have a fundamental problem with being physically male for the most part, though I do find some parts frustrating and at times mildly dysphoric.  I feel that ideally, I would love to have more hips and butt (a waist to hip ratio between male and female would put me on cloud 9), less body hair, mable not as much upper body bulk, and be able to be more female like graceful.  I KNOW I already have shit hot legs and can rock the right dress or skirt like it's nobody's business.  But I do like having the male brute strength when I need it, I'd be ambivalent at best about having breasts, and don't want the ability to use my penis for sex to take a hit.  Those would be some good reasons for me to question going on HRT, though I wouldn't completely rule it out if there is a possible dosage that can work well for me.  I know I can achieve less body hair through laser, and I have nothing to worry about in the leg department.  But I don't know what to do about the hips/butt part.  Some can be acheived through diet and exercise, but I want a bit of curve action going on when I get into a nice form fitting dress.  So I'd love once again to hear from some other AMAB folks who have gone through some form of non binary transition as to what they've experience and the route they've taken.

i spent my whole childhood obsessively thinking about how i wanted to be a girl, not a boy. when i reached adolescence it turned out i was attracted to girls; my focus shifted to attracting women more than wanting to be one.

more recently i unearthed the childhood experience i'd more or less repressed, and i've been reexamining my gender identity with a lot of curiosity and openness. what i've discovered is that my experience with gender fluctuates though trends far more to the female side of the spectrum. i'd say that if gender were a scale from 1 (female) to 10 (male), most of my time is spent between the 2-5 range, with periodic experiences on the male side between 6-8.

as i write this, it seems obvious that i'm genderfluid, but something about the trans marker often feels more appropriate, as i do feel pretty female, at least a lot of the time, and have since a pretty young age.
