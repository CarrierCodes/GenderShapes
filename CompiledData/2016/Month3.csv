This site has custom pronouns and your identity is just a series of tags, as many of which as you like being your gender. You get matched based on tags in ""i am"", ""you are"" and ""we'd be"". I am so excited about this site. :D

15,2016-03-04 20:55:17,48z9h8,4,2,"I am hoping that this is a good place to post this, but if there is a better Reddit, please let me know. Also, while I read Reddits regularly, this is my first attempt at a post, so I apologize if I mess anything up formatting-wise.

I am a 31 year old who was born male, I have a wonderful wife, a solid career as an editor and community college instructor, and a wonderful 4-month old son. For the most part, my life is great, but certain feelings have been rather persistent now that my life finally feels in order. 

When I was younger (as young as anywhere between 5 and 10) I used to always imagine what my life would be like if I was a girl instead of a boy. I played with toys meant for both genders--I had my Ninja Turtles and loved them, but I also played with my sister's Barbie dolls. I would imagine myself as the female characters in cartoons as much as the male characters (really, more so--I preferred to pretend I was Apirl O'Neil rather than any of the turtles for instance). I would go to sleep praying that I would wake up a girl even. And, yes, sometimes I snuck my sister's or mother's clothes when I was alone. 

All of that seemed to leave when I hit puberty though. I would still have the thoughts once in a while, but not nearly as much--maybe once every few months for a bit. New issues arose as I started to realize that my sexuality was not exactly the ""norm"" either. My first hard crush was on a guy friend of mine. Long story short, I discovered I was bisexual. All those child-hood thoughts were pushed aside and I chalked it up to symptoms of my sexual identity as opposed to my gender identity. At most, I thought maybe I just admired women's clothes or even fetishized them or something.

Not long after, I met the woman who is now my wife, a beautiful woman that I am very much attracted to and in love with. Fast forward another decade and I have a career, a marriage, and a kid, but now my thoughts of being a woman have resurfaced hard. To the point, even, that I became very depressed.

My wife bothered me until I spilled the beans. This was only just a week ago, so my life feels like it is entering a whole new whirlwind. Strangely though, I felt a lot of relief having confided these feelings in her--especially when she said she wanted to support me. I'm not feeling depressed like I was before, but the feelings (I guess dysphoria?) are still there, and I find myself questioning my gender identity more and more. 

On the outside, I am very masculine in appearance despite having a few feminine mannerisms. I had a beard up until recently (all the guys in my family do so I did too), stand 6'1"", and have pretty firm muscles. But something just doesn't feel like it fits. I don't think I could ever be ""girly,"" but I can't help but imagine having a feminine figure, breasts, hips, the whole nine yards. 

I just imagine I would be a tomboy--but why would I want to be a tomboy if I was born male? That is what is so confusing. I don't know what to do exactly. 

I come from a family that barely accepts my sexuality, so I know they wouldn't this. It's hard to experiment with it too since my wife's mother lives with us. I feel trapped and the depression, though briefly assuaged by my confession to my wife, seems like it will return. 

What I want to know is if anyone out there has had a similar experience? I am sure that is a silly question, as I am sure someone has; however, perspective from those with such a similar experience would be very helpful to me I think.

My wife agrees that I should probably see a therapist, and I would like to once I am able to find one that will accept my insurance--unfortunately my job's insurance requires I contact them first and I am afraid they are going to pry into why I need a therapist. She also wants to stay with me, and wants to try if I do end up transitioning, though we both sort of know things would not work out. She is bi-curious, but it does not go beyond curiosity. 

Again, please let me know if there is a better place to post this and ask this question.

I will also be asking your thoughts on advocacy efforts, general social climate, differences between trans millennials and trans baby boomers, and what is important for transgender people moving forward. I have a strong commitment to positive and genuine transgender representation. This project is approved by the Institutional Review Board and is being conducted with serious attention to respect and sensitivity. All participants will be de-identified to protect anonymity and confidentiality. There is no financial incentive to participation. To request to be interviewed, please contact me, Katie, at trans.interview@gmail.com. I am delighted to answer any questions you may have about this project or about myself. Thank you! \n\nMods, if you find that this post does not belong here, then please delete it.

We are tired of settling for sad menswear 'imitations' simply because the 'real thing' doesn't fit our smaller feet. We hate the frilly, frivolous detailing that usually comes on any brogue or wingtip that actually comes in our sizes. So finally, we decided to tackle the problem ourselves. 

We've developed four gender-neutral designs with an amazing, family-run factory in Portugal. We're using vegetable tanned leather, which is essentially heavy-metal-free, and will decompose entirely in 100 years if put into the ground.

So I have had a few mini epiphanies and for the most part (except for some hiccups here and there) I am feeling pretty awesome.

My therapist is awesome and its clear I am bi gender. Clear as day when I look back at things.

Until a friend said otherwise, I kept thinking I was a 'fraud' or that what I'm now going through isn't ""real"" since I am not ftm. But it is and I realized EVERYONES transition is different, theres no hard you must do this or you must go all the way. At the end of the day I feel we are all just trying to make ourselves more comfortable in our own skin and deal with our dysphorias so of course if mine is more mild my transition may not be as ""drastic"" but that doesnt make it any less.

Okay so I got my Peecock a few days ago (!!). At first I kind of freaked out staring at it. It was funny because I have straps ons/dilos etc but this, now this was the closest thing I would have to a ""real penis"", this was my penis. After I calmed down it felt amazingly normal. I felt so confident having BOTH a vagina and penis. 

I got a soft packer too, I'm not sure what i plan on doing with it,  I will have to experiment.

I noticed I am much much more vanilla in sex terms than I thought. This coming from someone who has labeled herself a female dominant and who has female led relationships, subs, and everything in between. I have read/heard becoming more vanilla isn't unheard of. And its pretty clear what areas of BDSM I was using as an ""outlet"" for my male side. For the first time ever I find myself looking at some types of vanilla porn. funny! But this gives me some more hope when I decide to start dating again as its one less thing I have to have on my list. 

I am looking at ways to physically present my male side. I like looking like a female, and will identity , so my goal isn't to look ambiguous but my face is VERY femme, its round, flat and kind of one dimensional thanks to multy racial background. Nothing sticks out at all but I am looking into some cosmetic procedures just to add some depth and dimension to my face. I also want to get a chin cleft as I always loved those.

I feel a bit of a minority here as I am fine with my body etc I just want to add. So I won't be taking any T, binding my chest etc. I don't like mens clothes.. I like men inspired clothes though. A well fitted suit to MY body is amazing. I may look into more European cuts for males then if I see something I like. 

I went back to my unisex fragrance which is nice too.

While I do this, I also find myself doing more ""girly"" things I either dismissed or felt like it was too ""girly"" because I was trying to fit myself into some box. So that's pretty cool. 

Anyone have any suggestions of things I can do to bring out my male side more without taking away my female side?

8,2016-03-03 02:27:03,48pw87,17,10,"About me: 23, AFAB. 

To try to keep it short, a few points:

* as a child, I was always jealous of my male cousins' Legos, Transformers, Hot Wheels, etc. and had no time for my own dolls - not exactly because I didn't like them, but because they were specifically *for girls*
* I have always preferred short hair, though only had it short once at 10 (I think I secretly wanted to be mistaken as a boy) and now, starting when I was 22 (partially due to ease of care and partially because I am far more comfortable in my skin with short hair)
* the terms 'woman' and 'girl' have never offended me, exactly, and on a certain level I can relate to them - however, not *entirely*
* the terms 'man' and 'boy' do not offend me, and I can relate to them, as well - but *less so* than with woman/girl
* my fashion sense is more androgynous/masculine (again, because that is how I feel more like myself)
* as a child, when separated by sex, (ie ""Girls to one side of the room, boys on the other!"" in class) I was never *jealous* to be away from the boys - just curious as to why I wasn't allowed over there, too
* being repeatedly called a woman, or miss, or ma'am, or sweetheart, or girl, etc. during work or during socializing is extremely grating and makes me begin to despise myself
* I have always hated the mold I am supposed to fit in as a ""woman""

Ergo, within this last few days, I've been trying out words such as *genderqueer, non-binary,* and *demigirl*.

*Demigirl* is where it gets messy. (I prefer demiwoman, or just demigender, but I digress -) The *demi* terms seem to be widely either unaccepted or full-on bashed. 

I do not want to finally figure out *who I am* only to be told ""Eh ... no, you're not. You're just trying to be cool.""

Does anybody have any opinions or advice? I *do* feel as though demigender describes me very well, as I *partially* identify with two binary genders (and, sometimes, I feel that I identify with something else entirely off of the spectrum). But I don't want to go through with the hate that the *demi* terms seem to invite.

I always hesitate to use the term ""bi-gender"" because, once again, I do not identify completely with either binary gender. I have the opposite problem with ""non-binary"" - I *do* identify somewhat with both binary genders.

And I don't want to use ""genderqueer"" simply to appease others.

I'm in a rut.

If anyone has any questions that may help them understand how I feel better, please ask. And, again, if anyone has any advice or information, that is most welcome, too.

I would almost identify as a trans boy, but there are lot of feminine things I really enjoy (my long hair, cute clothes) and masculine things I want no part in (any kind of toxic masculinity, dominance socially or sexually, etc) and I feel some kinship with girls because they're the ones who I'm always grouped with and in the past have accepted me most, even if there are some feelings and experiences I don't relate to or feel comfortable with. 

So, I can recognize and accept these feelings I have, but I don't know what to do with them. I'm pretty sure I don't want hrt, and I don't want to go through any kind of official name change. I just wish people would see me the way I see me. It's lonely and frustrating having this very deep feeling that I'm not cis, but not really seeing or hearing about many people who have a similar experience.

So unfortunately (?) Both my genders male and female co exist simultaneously. I'm AFAB btw. Now that I'm not longer keeping my male side down as much I feel my emotions go from feeling great to just awful. I'm trying to find a balance both emotionally and physically.

Body wise I'm tall , curvy, big boobs hour glass. I used to powerlift and body build. I have also been practicing martial arts seriously for 20 years. 

I guess I'm having a rough time. Perfect example : first time ever I painted my finger nails a lovely shade of pale nude pink. Was a bit out of my comfort zone( I have a pretty edgy style ) but I liked the color and said eff it  . For a few days I was admiring it. Then I woke up one day feeling extra aggressive and  beyond hated the color so much I took it off immediately,I actually got a small weird panic attack when I would look down at it. It's not so much the nail polish but the color. This has happened a lot in the past and never thought it had to do with gender issues. I thought I was just a finicky person.

So my therapist is making me jot down a list so I can sort of come together and find what things do/don't trigger my dysphoria on my male side. A simple nude nail polish seems to be fine. (What I have on now ). 

But with that I'm going insane ! It seems only certain things trigger it. My hair (very long) is fine.

My face Is very feminine. I can't really complain as I'm seen as pretty attractive to the point I used to model. And that paid college etc. So I dont want to completely change my face but I plan on doing a few things cosmetically to enhance and give more dimension . Hopefully that will help with the dysphoria.

Little things like wearing male deodorant with female or unisex perfume ( there's this lovely uni fragrance I've worn for years) helps.I feel like I'm a minority of a minority because I never wake up feeling just male etc. I don't have two different names either. I have no desire to look ambiguous or even really androgynous, but I want to be happier.

I plan on starting to train heavy again as I realized I liked my body best when I have some muscles and it actually looks like I lift. I have a habit of going one extreme to the next but this time I'm hoping to find a lovely balance as recently I'm actually liking some of my curves, but right now I'm super out of shape so it's a bit much for me having a soft feminine body. I did get a prosthetic penis and a packer I wear here and there and that has helped tremendously.

53,2016-03-13 02:12:01,4a6lry,2,7,"Hi, I made two posts here ages ago [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/3pet6v/im_a_little_bit_confused_about_myself/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/3q3imq/my_gender_seems_to_be_linked_to_music/). If it rings a bell, I was the guy (or whatever) that had their gender influenced by music. Anyway, it's been about four months since then, and my experience has changed. I find myself comfortable in my body a lot more, almost all of the time in fact. I often think that that two months or so of feeling horrible were in fact wacky hormones. Another possibility is related to the fact that I do sometimes exaggerate my problems into disorders in my head because of a horrible self pity thing (which I am working on), so it could have been that as well.

So I've just got a few questions for anyone on a low dose of E as I feel that might be the path I want to take.

1. Has your sexual function/equipment been affected? I'm not particular dysphoric with regards to my junk and I'm hoping that everything downstairs keeps working as usual, random boners excepted.

2. What has your breast development been like? I'm very on the fence about things in the chest region and at this point in time I'm hoping on a low dose of E I wont be provoking any further development (on top of what grew during my last stint on stronger HRT). If it turns out I want them after going on low E I can always up my dose, I'm just hoping that I can try out low E to see if that's where I'm comfy first.

3. What other feminisation can I expect? Mild feminisation of face and figure? Reduction in body hair? Smoother, better skin? Because I'm down for all that. 

Obviously this is all a YMMV situation and I need to dial in my dosages to work things out, and speak to my endo, but unfortunately I don't see him for another 5 months. So I was gonna get a headstart at least and see if I could find a comfortable middle ground so to speak. 

Would love to hear some insight into anyone who is in a similar situation and I would really like if you dont mind, if you could also list your E and T blood levels. Obviously not dosages as we're likely using different meds, but if I know what kind of ballpark I'm looking for with regards to my levels then I can hit that using my own meds and after discussing with my endo.

A hardly talked about issue is the question if somebody feels trans as an exit strategy to deal with another issue. 

I consider myself trans, but it's not as simple as that. I deal with a lot of self-loathing, avoidance and minor depression. I have symptoms I would describe as dysphoria. Hence I came to the conclusion to be trans after fighting myself for so long.

Yet I can't shake the feeling that I'm not really trans. 
A deep underlying thought remains that being trans is nothing but an way to escape myself. 
I have quite a lot of hate against myself, despite I'm actually having a great life, looking at circumstances like love, work, money and education. Yet, I consider myself a bad person with many negative traits. 

It's strange, but I feel like I failed at life. And I will never become a person I can deeply love myself as I never really did. At the same time I suffer a lot from huge narcissism, which just fits the picture, if you ask me. 

Following that logic, transition wouldn't do jack for me. So why the obsession with it? 

Where is the flaw in this thinking? Are there known cases of transition as escapism of other issues? I really need some guidance, because I'm quite lost at the moment.

Also: Is /r/genderqueer the right place for this question? Trans subreddits like asktg or mtf certainly aren't due to echo chambering. I feel like I'd get more differentiated answers here.

74,2016-03-15 16:35:09,4aj80b,2,2,"Warning: I talk a lot apparently. 

I know this is a rather debated topic already, but I wanted to share an experience I had recently about this. A little background, when I'm online I just present myself as a guy. If there's a male or female option when signing up somewhere, I pick male, because that's what I am and how I want to be seen. Of course I am neither a cis male nor cis female so technically neither is correct, but you understand. I am basically picking what pronouns I want to be called. I do not tell people I am a cis male, I do not describe myself with a cis male body, nothing like that. You want to know what to think of me as? I am a guy. There, easy enough. Now, as far as making connections with people online, if I get close enough to someone and think I might some day have a real life relationship with them, of course I will tell them hey just so you know I am transgender but that doesn't change how I want you to address me or anything. (honestly some people ask if they should call me a girl then, and I'm like.... No -facepalm-) I've had all kinds of reactions to this but most of the time the people I've made connections with are very kind and accepting. 

So, I've been talking to someone online for probably two months or so now and the other day one of our conversations got in to gendered bathrooms and how silly they are. It seemed like a good segway so I mentioned to them I felt like I identified more genderqueer than a stereotypical male or female but I liked male pronouns. They reacted pretty neutral to this in a good way. I saw the opportunity and told them about being AFAB but I know I am a guy and I have plans to transition physical to a more male appearance. They were really happy I shared that with them and said they didn't think of me differently, it was just something else they learned about me. Que overwhelming relief and happiness. I didn't think they'd have a problem with it but you know. They reassured me it's 1000000% okay and then we ended up getting in to some sexy talk hahaha so obviously the attraction didn't fade at all. (btw we are not dating) 

Anyway, the next day I told my sister, who knows about me being trans and is supportive, that I told this person the other night. She looked at me in surprise and said ""you hadn't told them yet??? Oh my god"" and I quirked my eyebrow at her like what's the big deal? The time felt right. She went on to explain how she felt like I should be upfront about that before making any kind of romantic connection with someone. She used the reasoning that there's people out there that wouldn't want to make a connection with a trans person so they should know what they're dealing with before any feelings get involved. I couldn't believe she was saying this to me. She told me that I'm not a cis guy so I shouldn't tell people I'm a guy and that I am lying to people by not introducing myself as a trans guy. Clarity, to people that I have feelings for. Meanwhile I am just metaphorically bleeding from all these daggers she's throwing at me.

I try to explain to her that it's not that easy, the world isn't that accepting yet, I have the right to my privacy and I get to choose who knows this about me and when I tell them. I told her she doesn't understand how people treat a trans person differently and why should I subject myself to that discrimination when I can just as easy say yes I am a guy and be on with my life until that information might be relevant to our relationship? And I know that this person is kind and will most likely accept me?

Anyway, eventually she understood that I wasn't being deceitful(and that she was very hurtful to imply that I was or that I was wrong to wait to tell them) and agreed that I was the only one who could know when someone is ready(and when I'm ready) to know such a thing about me. Yes other people who get romantically involved with me should know, but to me it is a tender subject and I wait for the right moment. We live in a world that is still really divided into only two options, male or female. Until the time comes that I can choose a nonbinary or transgender w/e then I have no choice but to identify as just male. My sister acknowledged she was coming from a place of ignorance and apologized for putting these abstract ideals on a real dynamic human relationship. She thanked me for educating her on what it was like to experience things as a trans person. lol

I know there's arguments to both sides of this, being upfront or being stealth until the right moment and only with certain people. Are there any other threads here about that? What are your thoughts? Have you ever been judged for not being upfront about something? I personally have never had someone tell me they wish I told them earlier. I've always been careful about who I tell and I work hard to make sure they see me as who I really am before telling them so there's no confusion.

77,2016-03-15 18:06:33,4ajmvn,2,2,"**My question:** Does anyone have any experience with getting top surgery and a hysterectomy in Canada without transitioning to male?


**Backstory:**
I've always known that I wasn't female and ever since I was a kid I thought I might be male though even that never felt quite right. I knew I didn't want to have reproductive organs nor did I want a female chest. I've always had dysphoria about these things and I've never liked how my body became more feminine as I got older though mostly that could be changed by losing weight which I'm currently working on.

I did take T from November 2014 - August 2015 but I decided I didn't want to fully transition to male because I'm not male but I'm not female either. I don't want facial hair or more masculine features.

Even from a young age I liked coming across genderless characters in video games, books, TV shows, etc. I always felt that's what I would like to be though I thought it wasn't possible.

I'm 24 now and I've come to realize that I don't have to be male or female. I'm agender/genderless.

Since I stopped taking hormones I'm sure most gender therapists or whatever will see that I've decided not to transition though that's not really true. I'd like to have top surgery as well as surgery to remove my reproductive organs. I'm just not sure what CMHA or anyone else is going to think of my wanting to be genderless. I've been told for years now that there's no way anyone's going to ""let"" me get a hysterectomy at a young age because most people are small-minded and think that all ""women"" will someday want to reproduce. I'm 24 years old. I've *never* wanted kids of my own, especially since my genes are terrible. I hope I can convince someone that I need to have a hysterectomy and top surgery for my mental health.

I'm wondering if anyone has any experience with getting top surgery and a hysterectomy in Canada without transitioning to male? There is a doctor in my city (in Ontario) that specializes in trans issues and that who I was seeing for months when I was on T. Since stopping T I haven't been back though and I'm not sure how they are about nonbinary genders. I might be able to commute to Toronto if I really have to though it'll be a bit difficult since I don't have a car.

I just really, really want to go about transitioning properly since I've wanted to pretty much my whole life.

As both an agender, and bi/pan-sexual person, I find that I don't fit in anywhere. Everyone else I know has some kind of gender identity and sexual preference, and I just -don't-. Gender just isn't a factor in my personal life, and it's really frustrating trying to navigate the world like this.
Especially when even LGBT spaces don't want you, because you're not really L, G, B or T. 
Explaining it to medical professionals is impossible, even those who specialize in ""LGBT"" issues, because they all want you to fit at least ONE of those boxes. (and on several occasions they just write you off as an attention seeker and/or offer to refer you to a generic stress councilor instead of letting you access their their gender specific services)

It's frustrating, but more than anything, it's lonely. 
And it's horrible that even when speaking to open minded people, about gender and sexuality, after the third or fourth time you have to tell them ""no, I'm not that either though"", they always start to huff and sulk, or get awkward, because you're not fitting in to their narrative of ""people they're open minded about"".

And maybe it's just a personal pet-peeve, but I find it so much worse when these people then say things like ""your turn will come"", and ""awareness IS being raised, you just have to wait your turn"".

Months ago I developed a crush on his roommate, also a cis male, and my feelings for him have waxed and waned over the months, but lately they've been pretty strong.

Now, my gender doesn't change on its own; it only changes when a trigger comes up; triggers for me can be thoughts and feelings; it doesn't matter what the thought or feeling is, as long as I somehow associate the trigger with the gender my identity changes to, although thoughts are *much* more likely to be triggers for me than emotions.

Most of the time, my gender identity stays neutral, in the middle between male and female (my gender can also fluctuate in intensity, but that's been *much* harder to trigger lately). I have learned over time that neutral is the ""main"" gender that it always gravitates back to after a certain period of time has passed, so each time my gender has changed to male or female, it eventually gravitates back to neutral after a while. Unfortunately, though, the male side has been *much* more easily trigger-able lately, which sucks. I fear that I may have accidentally subconsciously started to associate feelings of infatuation with the male gender, because I feel like those feelings change my gender from neutral to male now, which sucks, because being male/masculine is extremely uncomfortable for me because it causes me a lot of dysphoria since I'm AFAB.

I also really don't want to act on my feelings for my boyfriend's roommate because I still love my boyfriend very much and my feelings for his roommate haven't taken away from my feelings for my boyfriend. I wish I could tell him about my feelings for his roommate, *just* to clear the air, but I'm afraid I might hurt his feelings and make things awkward.

TL;DR: My male side has been making an appearance a lot more than usual, due to accidentally subconsciously associating many more types of thoughts with maleness and masculinity, as well as feelings if infatuation that I have for my boyfriend's roommate.

As a kid, I was a tomboy. I wore my hair up, hung out with guys, wore nike shorts and tee shirts (still a nike fan to this day #dedication. Haha)! Anyway, I remember as far as in preschool thinking mentally I was a boy. Even having a nightmare of my parents correcting me saying I was a girl.

Feeling more masc feels more, me. And I don't feel like a girl really. When I say I am a girl, it's weird to me to say that. But here's my thing, I don't mind being called her/she and my 'birthname'.

107,2016-03-20 21:41:24,4b9fkl,9,5,"Hey, so I'm having a bit of a dilemma when it comes to what to label myself as on OkCupid. I haven't been on the site for a bit, and when I did, I identified as male. in general, I'm a bit new to this. My general style and appearance is pretty clearly male still, and even though I am working on prettying up a bit, I am largely okay with my current look, and pretty fond of my beard. I'm not too concerned with ever properly achieving androgyny.

OkCupid has a pretty decent selection of gender identities and you can have as many as you want, but I'm torn as to whether I should add ""male"" onto my current label of agender. I do not feel even slightly male, but my body and the way I dress it up still looks like what people would call male. don't know whether it would be appropriate or not to include male so as to be less confusing to other people. I'm just looking for people to bang or hang out with, so I don't feel a definite need to weed out people who do not 100% get my identity, so long as we both think the other person is hot.

I've had two serious relationships in the past, both with men, but more than anything I have always dreamed of having a relationship with a woman. No, I'm not a lesbian, because I am very attracted to both men and women. I was attracted to the men I dated, and I was in love with them. The fact that I want to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with a woman does not change this!

I guess I'm not as covert as I think, because at the end of my senior year of high school I discovered from a student that the rumor around my school was that I was - ahem - bisexual. LOL. I assured them I was straight, because I was in denial and very unstable at that age. There was no way I could have come out back then, I just wasn't ready. My dad asked me if I was gay twice before, which I denied, but he was reassuring that he would support me if I was. I still felt I couldn't tell him though, because he would tell my mom, and I don't think she would take it well at all.

My mother is like a best friend to me. We are extremely close. I have tried to broach the topic of my sexuality with her recently, and even went as far as to tell her I wouldn't mind kissing a girl. Her reaction was to roll her eyes at me, laugh, and say ""Honey, you're not a lesbian.""

This was extremely hurtful to me. No, I'm not a lesbian - I am bisexual. Yes, I am very attracted to men, but I'm attracted to women as well! Bisexuality is a concept that my mother has outwardly said to me she believes is ""something kids identify as to look cool."" What she doesn't know is that I - her daughter - am a living and breathing example of a 20 year old bisexual woman.

While my mother is careless with her words sometimes, I can understand her point of view on some level. Perhaps some kids do use bisexuality as a way to ""rebel"" - but with all the ways to rebel against society - why would they choose their sexuality as an outlet for this? There has to be some truth to it I would think. Why would someone willingly subject themselves to a life that will be infinitely harder for them (being gay) if they weren't actually gay?? I'm also a believer that sexuality isn't static - your sexuality can change over time.

I never really put my gender or my identity on top of anything. Myself as a person is going to be the same person regardless of what I identify as and I want it to be that way. 

I've come to terms that I'm comfortable with who I am now, and don't need any changes to myself to express who I am in any way. However I believe that if I were born the opposite biological gender that I would be fine either way. However, I cannot accurately assume that unless I were to transition myself, and I don't think its worth doing in order to experiment with that idea. 
 
Apart from that, there are still some things I do which reflect a genderqueer identity. I still like keeping my gender vague and go by both female and male names, even if is through online association. I do break a lot of gender expectations, however it is difficult to express it as I'm not often in a public environment. 

Gender identity and me have been going at it since 2010, but I've come to terms with who I am. I have no idea what my identification is now, nor do I really care. I'm just at a point where I can finalize where my spot on the grid is.

152,2016-03-28 05:09:33,4c8wql,6,13,"Hello friends. I've recently, after a lot  of thought, reframed the way I see myself and have switched to gender neutral pronouns. As someone who originally started transitioning as MtF, the idea of not being a woman, but just being human, is extremely liberating. I'd like to share my thoughts and experience for discussion and relating to others (and try to keep it short).

My identity as someone who is genderqueer is not rooted in being non-binary, fluid, or anything similar to that - in fact, it a sort of non identity that's used to cement myself outside of what societal labels inherently restrict. Being genderqueer is to exist outside of the boxes we all to know too well. For me, it's a rejection of gender as a concept.

I wanted (and still will) to ""transition"" because I didn't feel comfortable in my body. My male genitalia, figure, etc. was not desirable, thus I started HRT and attempting to be a woman.

The problem comes from trying to be a woman. Even though I fully support that there are no restrictions to being a woman (which begs the question why does gender even matter), I would still feel negatively if I didn't meet some,  even though I'm still comfortable with it   I.e. my voice is still very low but I really don't care.

Nevertheless, by being a woman I was both limiting myself to those restrictions (due to the inherent meaning of being a woman) and subjecting others to judging me and interpreting me as a woman , which resulted in uncomfortable feelings if I didn't meet assumed standards (the voice, masculine presentation, etc.)

Therefore, I've realized that the only way to truly feel comfortable with myself in this society is to reject the notion of gender altogether. Being a woman,man, or other gender inherently separates persons and, due to social shaming, implicitly restricts what can or can't be done. And if we are to advocate that you can do whatever you want and still be a man or woman, what is the point of gender if not to appease existing social constructs?

 Due to the aforementioned reasons, I reject gender and ""identify"" as genderqueer because it makes me comfortable with myself. I'm still going to present rather feminine and get the body I need to be comfortable. I expect gender neutral terms so I know others aren't seeing me as a man or woman and basing their interactions through that, or are at least trying.

Again, it's extremely liberating to not just reject being a man or woman, but reject any identity within the gender spectrum. There is a political side to it, as any identity will have, but it's a huge weight to no longer have to live up to any masculine, feminine, or androgynous standards.

I'd like to hear your thoughts as well, especially if this sounds like you (as most genderqueer persons I meet are gender abolitionists necessarily). I'd also like to say thank you for reading and hearing my thoughts, and that I really appreciate anyone willing to listen.

156,2016-03-29 01:36:34,4cdb8t,6,2,"Hello folks,

first of all some things about me: I'm a 19 year old AMAB and I started to seriously questioning my gender identity some months ago.

I somehow have always known that I don't fit entirely in the male spectrum but I always pushed it away and thought I would grow out of it eventually. The thought of not being entirely male was unsettling and for some reason caused panic in me.

The event that caused me to question my gender identity is a nervous breakdown some months ago. Since then I told myself to try to think more about me to become more of the person who I am. I'm not depressive at all since I am a very positive person but I'm often very sad, especially when I'm alone.

So.. I'm not 100% sure as what I identify yet. I'm presenting myself as male all of the time right now since I live with my parents but I want to change that soon.

Right now I identify as genderfluid or dualgender since I do like to be male and present myself as one. Sometimes I feel more like a girl though. Or both in one?

I'm fine with my body. I'm 1.81m (that's about 6""0' in freedom units I guess), skinny and athletic, quite handsome and overall sort of androgynous. I don't like my body hair and very deep voice though. So you can say that I have slight dysphoria.

This all is very confusing to me. Sometimes I think to myself it's all ridiculous I am male, it's the way I am born and feel comfortable. But then I feel like there's more of me, more of a female side. And sometimes I even think I'm a transsexual, but I don't want to live as a girl full time. I'd love to be both, to dress as what I feel like in the moment. So that makes me dualgender? Additionally there are times when I think fuck gender, I will just be myself and move on. So that's agender I guess? 

It's very strange. Whatever answer I find doesn't really open my eyes. 

As a kid I never wanted to play with dolls or dress up, I liked to play with dinosaurs and cars. I even played one of the manliest sports you can play, icehockey, for 10 years, and besides of the slight bullying I loved it and even miss it. I remember being envious of girls hair and clothes when I was about 12, so I crossdressed from time to time. This was very (sexually) satisfying to me, so maybe it all is just a fetish? I really don't know. After crossdressing I often feel sort of disgusted and stop doing it for months.

I didn't open up to anyone yet, just jokingly mentioned to my best friends that I was genderfluid. They and my parents would all be perfectly fine with it since I grew up with cases of homosexuality in my close family and also one of my friends that my parents know is out as trans (FtM). So that's not a problem, they are all supporting and loving.

Since some months this all is the only thing that really bothers me. I don't like that since I go to school and it often distracts me from work that has to be done.

My sexual orientation is pansexual or straight if that matters. Sometimes when I see a beautiful girl I don't know whether I can't stop taking my eyes of her because I am attracted to her or envious.

What should I do to not to be thinking about what I am all the time? How do I get in a satisfying state? How do I figure myself out and start living already?

158,2016-03-29 05:34:46,4ce5e2,11,12,"The first clue by four came a little under 2 years ago. I took some acid, tripped, and for the entire trip my body felt very male even though I am AFAB. I sobered up and still felt that way, for days, weeks, a month. I realized it wasn't something that was just a part of the trip. It was a part of myself I revealed. I wasn't content until I issued that part of myself a more masculine name, embraced it further with things like boxers I liked, and allowed myself to occasionally ask my friends to use different pronouns with me. For about a year and a half, I was content with this. I still primarily presented as female and kept the pieces of more masculine things as I wanted them, though it was largely for just myself and not others. I considered myself genderfluid. 

A couple of months ago, a flurry of things happened along with my second clue by four. I had been getting very close to a guy I met on Craigslist. We had intense chemistry and were very much into each other. I was open with him about my genderfluidity. He wanted to know more about that part of me and was altogether very positive about it which was a good experience for me in that I'd been rather reserved about that part of myself with most people. Being with him seemed to continue to bring out a much more masculine feeling in me. Whether it was comfort, our chemistry, our dynamic, I don't know, but the more I saw him the more I felt at ease with it, as if I was walking into something comfortable. 

At a concert, we decided to do acid together. We came home from the concert, added MDMA, and had an intensely meaningful and powerful trip overall together. I told him how I felt about him. He told me how he felt about me. We became a couple. Before that weekend, he had offered himself to me as a submissive. I was considering him, us, my wants. While cuddling him in my arms, I told him that I wanted him to be mine. Not only that, but I wanted to be his master, not his mistress. He smiled and agreed readily. I asked him to call me by my more masculine chosen name, and he nodded. We sat in silence for a few moments. I was thinking about just how gay the romance between us felt. At the very same time he asks me, 'So Neo is gay?' I laughed, nodded, and from that moment forth I have come to identify how I feel as genderqueer. 

I don't feel that my gender is fluid. I see gender like a spectrum with female/feminine qualities being on one extreme and male/masculine qualities being on the other. I see myself as sitting off the middle more on the side of masculine. While my attraction is not limited to cis males, I feel gay in the sense that I'm primarily attracted to male or masculine individuals, rare exceptions for some female/feminine folk. 

I haven't come out to everyone I know yet. I have decided to wait for national coming out day to fully come out to everyone I haven't yet come out to. I feel like waiting for this will allow me time to feel more at ease and less new and swirling in space about everything which in turn I think would make it easier for me to work through the stress/nervousness coming out. Coming out to people I know little by little has made it easier every time. Like practice! I've come out to my closest friends, my brothers, and an increasing number of other people. I introduce myself as my present identification when meeting new people as I decided it would be way less awkward for me than having to come back and tell them about it all over again, get it all out of the way now, eh! That and playing at being a girl outside of work and when the time comes, select family things, is not very enjoyable to me. 

This has all been very strange for me due to the clue by four nature of this discovery. I was an ally before all this so I would like to think I mentally allowed myself the space to be myself as much as I felt I needed to. I certainly wasn't closeted to the idea of other gender identities anyway and already surrounded by lots of very accepting and open friends. After doing some research, I think the reason I am noticing this now (I'm 27) and not earlier in my life is the amount of trauma I went through in my pre-teens/teens. If I had come out in my teens, I really don't think I'd be alive today. I was going through sooooo much then already and often teetered at the edge. I could totally understand if all this was mentally hidden to allow me to survive it all. After coming out to myself, I frequently find myself revisiting memories and other aspects of my life in a whole new light. Simple things where that boyish part shone through and got attributed to being a tomboy. It's like I was always myself, just that this portion was hidden and unseen for a long time. 

Things have been largely positive. My partner is amazingly supportive of me. My roommate is also aware and very supportive which gives me a very comfortable home base that helps a lot. Everyone I've come out to with the exception of one asshat on reddit has been kind to me. I've committed myself to only changing things if I want to change them which has made a lot of sense. Nothing needs to change unless I want it to, after all :-)

It has been an interesting journey. I struggle with some things, like meeting new people. Social situations outside of work or people I know and feel comfy with in general give me anxiety now. It's just very stressful to introduce myself as I want to be introduced and then attempt to interact. It's like I feel like I forgot how to. I used to be a total social butterfly which makes me feel like I've reverted :-/

Part of me mourns the girl that I was if that makes any sense. It's not that I don't feel I can enjoy anything feminine anymore. I just don't think/feel that way anymore. Very simple things, like if I reach for underwear in the morning and my first choice is boxers and not lacy panties. Tastes, feelings, thoughts, are changing. I was very happily a girl before that clue by four. I'm very happy now even amidst the struggles here and there. It's a very hard thing for me to describe. It's like the more I embrace myself now, the more I feel like that part of me is gone, changing, new. It's one thing to change parts of yourself that you felt were negative. You're at some level happy to see them go even if it was hard to let go. It's another thing entirely when it's different changes I guess. I spent so much time teaching myself to love the girl that I was and now I have come to love a me that has changed a lot. 

I am patient with myself. I have quit taking things as absolutes and prepare to see the layers continue to unfold as I continue to learn. For the first time in my life, I'm thriving and not just surviving. I'm the most content I have ever been. It is the strangest feeling. I have the support, love, space, and time to be everything that I am. Getting hit by a couple clue by fours has got to be the most confusing thing I've had happen to me, but I am appreciating the pros of it :-)

Thank you for reading! It feels good to get this out more. That and I still have many people who message me on reddit presuming my previously female identification which just gets more awkward for me the more it happens and I would not like to abandon ship and change my handle &gt;.&gt; Having this out on here about myself makes is much more comfortable for me in continuing to interact with you lovely folks on reddit.",genderqueer,"Got hit by a clue by four, not just once, but twice",1459254886.0,"{'created_utc': 1459229686, 'id': '4ce5e2', 'num_comments': 11, 'score': 12, 'selftext': ""The first clue by four came a little under 2 years ago.

After coming out to myself, I frequently find myself revisiting memories and other aspects of my life in a whole new light. Simple things where that boyish part shone through and got attributed to being a tomboy. It's like I was always myself, just that this portion was hidden and unseen for a long time. \n\nThings have been largely positive. My partner is amazingly supportive of me. My roommate is also aware and very supportive which gives me a very comfortable home base that helps a lot. Everyone I've come out to with the exception of one asshat on reddit has been kind to me. I've committed myself to only changing things if I want to change them which has made a lot of sense. Nothing needs to change unless I want it to, after all :-)\n\nIt has been an interesting journey. I struggle with some things, like meeting new people. Social situations outside of work or people I know and feel comfy with in general give me anxiety now. It's just very stressful to introduce myself as I want to be introduced and then attempt to interact. It's like I feel like I forgot how to. I used to be a total social butterfly which makes me feel like I've reverted :-/\n\nPart of me mourns the girl that I was if that makes any sense. It's not that I don't feel I can enjoy anything feminine anymore. I just don't think/feel that way anymore. Very simple things, like if I reach for underwear in the morning and my first choice is boxers and not lacy panties. Tastes, feelings, thoughts, are changing. I was very happily a girl before that clue by four. I'm very happy now even amidst the struggles here and there. It's a very hard thing for me to describe. It's like the more I embrace myself now, the more I feel like that part of me is gone, changing, new. It's one thing to change parts of yourself that you felt were negative. You're at some level happy to see them go even if it was hard to let go. It's another thing entirely when it's different changes I guess. I spent so much time teaching myself to love the girl that I was and now I have come to love a me that has changed a lot. \n\nI am patient with myself. I have quit taking things as absolutes and prepare to see the layers continue to unfold as I continue to learn. For the first time in my life, I'm thriving and not just surviving. I'm the most content I have ever been. It is the strangest feeling. I have the support, love, space, and time to be everything that I am. Getting hit by a couple clue by fours has got to be the most confusing thing I've had happen to me, but I am appreciating the pros of it :-)\n\nThank you for reading! It feels good to get this out more. That and I still have many people who message me on reddit presuming my previously female identification which just gets more awkward for me the more it happens and I would not like to abandon ship and change my handle &gt;.&gt; Having this out on here about myself makes is much more comfortable for me in continuing to interact with you lovely folks on reddit."", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Got hit by a clue by four, not just once, but twice', 'created': 1459254886.0}"

169,2016-03-30 06:34:12,4cjn0i,7,6,"Hey there. It's Emett. I think, I haven't chosen a name or spelling for sure yet. I've been browsing the trans subs for a while for info and wanted to see if I could get some feedback on my situation. I've been researching trans stuff so intensely for the past few weeks ever since I removed someone from my life who was holding me back and telling me I couldn't be nb because it doesn't exist.

I've been questioning my gender for 3-4 years now. I don't trust the validity of my own feelings about it because I have a history of having an overactive imagination along with self esteem issues created by a(n extremely) smothering evangelical upbringing. It wasn't until 3 years ago that I was finally able to break free from the toxic, utterly isolating atmosphere. Like, I was home schooled, the whole rap. Never really socialized with anyone outside of a small church family because I only left the house for church and groceries. I had internalized the religious indoctrination in ways that manifested as mental illnesses. (yay) OCD, depression, anxiety attacks, separation anxiety, and I'm looking into Borderline Personality Disorder because the DSM definition fits me fairly well, which sucks. So, yeah. I don't trust my own head because it's kind of fucked.

I want to find a gender specialist but I have no idea how to go about getting one in my area and that takes my insurance. I live in Connecticut and am still on my dad's insurance for a couple of years. My school therapist (I've since dropped out) told me she has gay and trans patients at her personal practice and that she wanted to start an LGBT support group. I thought that was great until she misgendered her own patient. She seemed to know a little about non binary identities and took me seriously when I asked about it but insisted I don't tell my friends until I was entirely sure I knew what I wanted to do and if I wanted to transition. Anyway, point is it's hard for me to trust mental health professionals based on my experience, mainly because some of my issues seem to be slightly outside the typical therapist's field of knowledge.

I live with my adorable pansexual partner who is totally accepting of my gender feels and comfortable with me exploring options and/or transitioning if I end up feeling that's what I need. I'm underemployed and don't have any skills outside of retail and a little bit of illustration so I'm not sure how much monetary access to resources I'll be able to have.

I feel like I'm rambling so I'll get to the T concerns and the part where I talk about dysphoria.

I'm pretty happy with my body aesthetically, there are parts of being AFAB that make me feel good about myself and beautiful, like my small but perky breasts. I got a lot of compliments on my body from exes and it made me feel good. I even went into camming briefly for some extra income. 

However there are parts of my body that I would gladly change. I've been slightly bottom dysphoric for years. Shit, why couldn't I have been born with a dick? It's unfair. I'd bum myself out about it, even though having a vulva is....ok I guess? I don't feel like it's ugly or gross, just that I'd rather have a cock. I'd like to grow more hair on my belly and legs. I really fucking wish I could grow a happy trail for some reason or another. My brother is super hairy and has a pretty deep voice, so that concerns me. A super deep voice would likely make me 100 times more dysphoric, but some deepening would be welcome because I don't really like my feminine voice. I'm not planning to surgically remove my breasts or get genital reassignment surgery, but I recently learned about the clitoral grown that happens to a lot of T guys and I'm super into that for myself. My clit's pretty tiny as it is and I'm a little embarrassed about it, though I know I shouldn't be and sizes vary but it's more like insult to injury on top of already wishing I had a cock. But no, I have a very small clit. I can barely see it even when I'm aroused.

Maybe it'd be easier if I turned my concerns into a list. This post is probably pretty meandering and rambly right now...

PROS OF T
- hair growth
- voice change
- clit growth hell yeah!!
- possible muscle gain?
- possible increase in libido?

CONS OF T
- could get too hairy
- voice could get too deep
- balding with sustained use over years, there is balding in my family on both sides
- don't know the long term mental effect, could regret transition

I'm not interested in appearing incredibly masculine, more like somewhere in between with aspects of masculine and feminine. I know the person who runs Neutrois Nonsense talks about low dose T but they also had concerns about not seeing changes fast enough. I thought about the concept of taking a higher initial dose and switching to a small maintenance dose after a month or two to slow the effects. Based on my research most T guys see clitoral growth within the first few weeks, and I've seen videos of these guys and their ""cocks"" and they're pretty fucking appealing to me. Being able to get visibly erect would do so much for my self image. Plus many videos I've watched show that the voice continues to deepen for the first few months, so I figure there's some time to change my mind if I think it might change too much?

I am also concerned about fertility and periods. I'm currently on birth control and I want to make sure I can't get pregnant if I have to go off it to transition. My partner and I are steady and (currently) monogamous and do not use condoms. We tried for a while when I was switching methods but I've had condoms break on me with multiple partners and he's bigger than other guys I've been with so it's even more of a concern. I know there are larger condoms but I'd really like to not have to use them. I also get pretty awful periods when I go off my birth control. I'm open to the idea of a hysterectomy (though it'd require some consideration) but I read you have to take some sort of hormones for the rest of your life if you do that because you don't produce estrogen naturally anymore.

There's no TL;DR here because I did too much ranting. If I could sum it up in a question, it'd just be ""does anyone have any information pertinent to my situation?""

177,2016-03-31 06:23:57,4coujn,10,18,"I have... a bit of a problem, and it's one that's difficult to explain. I'm here because I think the genderqueer label is probably the best places to find folks that will understand- it's about unconventional gender complications. I've been having a really difficult time the past week. I've been falling down the depression hole and the fact that I don't have anybody that relates to the nuances has been hard.

I'm not the only person like me by any stretch, but most of us end up as MRA's. I was a boy raised in a radical feminist household. My mum became involved with the womyn's spirituality movement in the 80's. She studied in Z. Budapest's circles at the Michigan Womyn's festival and the majority of her social circles at home were the local lesbian separatist/ political lesbian groups. Outside of school and my grandfather, my only male influence as a kid was a bear of a gay man.

I had two childhoods. One was the idealist one. When other kids were being read children's books, mum was reading essays on deconstructing gender. As a kid, I'd chastise elementary school teachers for using the phrase ""boys and girls"" because it made an artificial distinction. Stuff like that. I didn't understand gender itself- she tried to raise me to be gender neutral- so I'd slip between presenting as a boy and presenting as a girl to try to figure it out with hands on experimentation.

The other childhood was the hard truth of what happens when you raise a boy around people whose most common unifying trait is that most of them had traumatizing experiences with men. My mum tried to shield me from the most overt parts of it, but kids always hear more than adults think. The standard way it'd play out: ""All men are rapists. Oh, except you, Ram. You'll be different.""

I couldn't bridge the gap between the things I heard about men from my mum's circle and how I felt. I couldn't bridge the gap between the expectations of the mainstream society and how I felt. As a teen, I looked to things like genetic mosaicism or Klinefelter's to try to explain the discrepancies. I wasn't the thing that was described by the feminists or the mainstream, so I had to be something else instead.

That middle section also had a lot in it that'll feel familiar to trans folk. I avoided public restrooms like my life depended on it- I was effeminate enough that I'd be threatened if I went into one (the guy yelling at me through the stall about how I was a pervert; the teacher who nearly took me to the principal's office; etc). When the kids in elementary school asked which girl I wanted to marry... well, we all know that marriage is a patriarchal institution used to economically and socially enslave women. My response was ""I'd rather be one than marry one."" I thought that was the *safe* answer. I was 'the girl in the boys locker room' through my junior year in high school (something that, on one occasion, meant the PE teacher calling the office to confirm my official sex).

As I've grown older, it's started to hit me in a different way. When I was told ""all men are rapists"" as a kid, it was one thing. But now I'm 31. I look in the mirror and I see a fully bearded adult. A man. The various misandristic expectations have started exploding. Men are the source of all wars. Men are the source of all economic inequality. A man's very existence is an act of violence. I'm a man.

Every once and awhile I look for people like me, but we're rare beasts. The few visible ones end up in MRA circles where, as you might imagine, they absolutely lap up our stories. We make great ammo for strawman arguments against feminism. Hell, we *are* the strawman arguments. But I can't stand my story being used that way even if it's the most direct path to solidarity.

181,2016-03-31 19:25:33,4crma5,10,20,"I'm AMAB and nonbinary, pretty open about it, I cross a fair amount of gender boundaries, often, in my daily life, in how I dress and present myself.  In terms of my identity I feel mostly agender, a little more female than male, and I use they/them pronouns.

I have read (and continue to read) lots of accounts from AMAB people, talking about how they often wear women's clothing in private, such as wearing an article like women's underwear, that isn't visible, as they go through the day, or wearing women's clothing at home.

I think I understand why people do this, but I feel like I'm the opposite.

I feel much more motivated to present more femininely when I'm out and about, in public, around people, than when I'm at home. I don't own any women's undergarmets and the only time I wear and article of women's clothing that isn't visible is when I wear a pair of leggings underneath my pants, in the coldest parts of winter.  I own and wear a lot of skirts, several dresses, women's shorts, women's t-shirts, women's button down shirts and cardigans, several pairs of women's shoes (just casual sneakers), and some little ornaments like hair clips.

My reasoning is as follows:

* I think I look more attractive in women's clothing, because it shows off my body more (which I like) and tends to fit me better than most men's clothing I own.
* women's clothing tends to have softer textures which can make people want to touch me more, and also make it feel more comforting when I hug, cuddle, or are close to people.
* women's clothing is more likely to have bright, cheerful colors and patterns, or cute accent features that are more likely to cheer people up or make them smile, or be a talking point or conversation starter
* I get more compliments both on my clothing and fashion sense, and on my body, when i wear women's clothes and I like that
* by wearing women's clothing i'm breaking a gender norm, and this thus expresses and potentially communicates something deep about my personality, not just my gender identity, but also that I'm someone who is courageous when it comes to breaking norms, and who is an outside-the-box thinker, willing to question things.
* men's clothing feels more rough / rugged / durable and I feel physically safer and more physically protected when wearing it.  if I'm alone, I'm more likely to do things like cleaning or working in the garden, and I prefer wearing men's clothes when doing these things.

I do get some benefits / enjoyment out of wearing women's clothing when alone, like I enjoy the softer textures, I think I look cute, etc. but I feel like when left to my own devices I often change back into men's clothing at home if I'm by myself because it's often more practical, whereas I get more excited about showing off all my cute outfits when I'm out and about and around people.

I'd be curious to hear if there are any other people out there like me in this respect.  In particular, I'm curious if other people have noticed these different relative benefits of women's vs. men's clothing, and who also see women's clothing as primarily carrying social benefits and thus like wearing it more when around people.  I could imagine these ""benefits"" are all relative, like some people might want to move away from women's clothing if they don't like some of the implications (like more comments on your clothing / body / appearance).",genderqueer,"Any AMAB people more motivated to wear women's clothing in public, than in private?",1459477533.0,"{'created_utc': 1459452333, 'id': '4crma5', 'num_comments': 10, 'score': 20, 'selftext': 'I\'m AMAB and nonbinary, pretty open about it, I cross a fair amount of gender boundaries, often, in my daily life, in how I dress and present myself.

It's been getting better now that I've semi-accepted that part of myself.

Recently I've been having meltdowns where I can't look at myself in the mirror any more and cry about my body. I wish I had hips instead of a strong jawline; a natural hourglass (I can fake it with a corset) instead of an Adam's apple.

These feelings come in waves, thus wondering if 'genderfluid' describes me better than M2F trans. When I ask myself ""am I a woman?"" the answer is no.

31,2016-03-23 03:45:52,4bkz8s,11,1,"So, I wrote a small thing on an askreddit question, and it blew up. this is basically what I described myself as gender wise on the question:


Its strange hearing about those who are gender fluid who freak out over the issue. For me, my sex is female. I am a woman. however, my soul is neither gender. I dream of being male and female, and have no issue with either body. I don't even realize theres a difference. I was given a body to move around in, socialize with, that protects me and helps me out on this earth. And thats pretty nifty. So, I suppose I feel like neither gender (I don't really feel like I have a gender) but my sex doesn't bother me. I have boobs, thats kinda cool. and hey, vaginas are lovely. so are penises. no big deal which one I'm given. It just is what I was put in. no biggy. I don't see the big issue about being in a body when you feel like neither gender.
I can empathize, despite that, because thats my personal take on it and others react very differently and have very different circumstances. its tough to view your body as not a part of who you are that shows the real you.
(I am talking about gender fluid as in feeling like neither gender here. the scale is WAY bigger then that, so I respect and hope all beings regardless of circumstance find happiness within themselves and the body they were given.)

Edit: I am talking about being in an ""alien"" body in the sense that, yes I have a human body and its female, but my soul is not really either gender.
On a more ""crazy"" side of it, I don't feel particularly human inside my body. (This is different then the gender thing, my apologies) I mean, I am a human because I am in a human body, and thats totally fine. But as a soul, I don't particularly feel like I could only be a human and thats it. If I am given another life I would be fine being a tree (ok I might get bored, I don't know) or a bird or something. But I want to know: is that just my religious view point, or a part of how I identify myself as a soul in a human body? So I am never quite sure if its normal for people to feel only human or just a soul who happened to be placed into a human body for this lifetime. thoughts? ideas? This is weird I know. Do most people feel their soul is human?


So, with this..am I actually gender fluid? I would be fine in a male or female body, and I don't particularly feel like I have a gender, which is why I wouldn't mind at all to being a different sex. I enjoy being a female though, and hardly ever even think about my ""gender"". I don't have body dysmorphia, I feel like I am a woman and can do woman things and enjoy woman activities, but soul wise I really am not any gender at all. The idea that people believe their souls to be gendered blew my mind. It was so normal for me to think that we were genderless souls put inside gendered bodies (especially with the fact that I am not oppressed in any way, no one hurts me or even really knows, and its so ""whatever"" to me that I hardly notice it myself) that it just blew me away to think that people felt differently.

Am I just a normal cisgender person? or am I gender fluid?

Do most people feel their soul is human?\n\n\nSo, with this..am I actually gender fluid? I would be fine in a male or female body, and I don\'t particularly feel like I have a gender, which is why I wouldn\'t mind at all to being a different sex. I enjoy being a female though, and hardly ever even think about my ""gender"". I don\'t have body dysmorphia, I feel like I am a woman and can do woman things and enjoy woman activities, but soul wise I really am not any gender at all. The idea that people believe their souls to be gendered blew my mind. It was so normal for me to think that we were genderless souls put inside gendered bodies (especially with the fact that I am not oppressed in any way, no one hurts me or even really knows, and its so ""whatever"" to me that I hardly notice it myself) that it just blew me away to think that people felt differently.\n\nAm I just a normal cisgender person? or am I gender fluid?\n\n', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Not sure what I am?

38,2016-03-26 19:01:00,4c2e0z,7,8,"Sorry for the depressing wall of text. I grew up in a religious home. I have nothing against religion in general. I have a family that loves me. Unfortunately, my family doesn't always follow all of the love and acceptance parts, instead using religion as a justification for intolerance.

This lead to a lot of confusion for me growing up. It was made very clear early on that non-gender-conforming behavior wouldn't be tolerated. As a kid, this lead to a lot of inner turmoil as I struggled with my gender identity and its occasional conflicts with my anatomy. At the time, I didn't clearly understand the source of my discontent; growing up in such a sheltered environment, I didn't have *any* exposure to non-cis non-straight friends or role models. I didn't have the vocabulary to compose the thought of my gender not matching my sex. Indeed, it was a given that those two terms meant the same thing.

Lacking a context to frame these thoughts and feelings, I came to the conclusion that they meant that I was broken, or sinful. I would ""punish"" myself for these bad feelings, either mentally berating myself or sometimes engaging in self-harm. When adolescence arrived, things got even more frustrating as I didn't develop the interest in girls that my peers did. I didn't feel any attraction to men either, but not being attracted to women in my mind meant that I might be gay, more fuel for the broken/sinful fire.

During this time, my family had (and still has) no idea that any of this was going on with me. I completely internalized and hid all of it from them and everyone else. They're still nice people and I still love them, but explaining to them that I'm gender fluid (a term I discovered around age 30 that seems to fit me well enough) wasn't likely to be well received. As in, it's highly likely that all communication with them would be cut off, I wouldn't be allowed to see my nieces and nephews anymore etc. That's not something I'm willing to risk.

Around the time of my 30th birthday, things hit a low. I lost my job. I had been struggling a *lot* with dysphoria and self-harming. By this time I'd been exposed to a much broader world in terms of sex, gender and sexual identity, but I was still locked in the binary mindset of cis vs trans and straight vs gay.

Eventually I broke down and decided to explore the portion of my gender that isn't strictly in line with my sex. It was a slow, painful process filled with shame and self-loathing. I felt like I was giving in to sin, that what I was doing was wrong, but at the same time it was eye-opening and freeing in a way that's difficult to describe. Realizing that there's a term for the feelings I'd had my entire life was a revelation.

Lost amidst all of this confusion, I decided to confide in my closest friend about what I was going through. She was very understanding and supportive, and we would regularly meet up to talk about things in confidence. She helped me with ideas for how I could express some of my feminine feelings, helped me purchase a few items of clothing/makeup etc. Mostly just having someone to talk to about things was a huge relief. It took its tole on the friendship though. In the last year we've hung out less and less. She doesn't respond to texts and I can't seem to get on her calendar. At the beginning of 2016 she basically said she doesn't have time to be friends with me anymore. In the space of 3 years, the one person I told my secret to, the one person most likely to accept who I am in all it's non-conformity, and it basically ended our friendship. I feel like I'm a little kid again, hating myself for what I am and the distance it puts between me and the people I care about.

I'm not looking for a pity party, and I'm not looking for someone to fix all my problems for me. I have no intention of harming myself or anyone else.
