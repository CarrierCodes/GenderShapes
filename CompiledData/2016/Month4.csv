2,2016-04-05 19:40:59,4di42z,1,10,"Hi. Born female, (mostly) identify as femme. This has been a big, confusing, long journey for me.

As a little girl, I often felt at odds with myself, my body, and what was expected from me as a girl. There were times where being a girl felt right, especially when I was able to use my body how I wished (being active, climbing trees, just feeling safe and free). But I often felt so odd when expected to ""act like a lady."" I never quite knew how to wrap my brain around that. Of course, now I know that I was feeling at odds with expectations and wondering why people wanted me to do some things but not others.

I acted out a lot. I was absolutely fortunately blessed by young, slightly radical parents who in my early years were very much unlike other parents who forced their kids to dress and act through gender norms. My parents' small act of rebellion against their own families' rigid gender roles and judgmental attitudes was such a saving grace. Instead, they simply wanted me to be a strong and happy person. In a lot of ways, days when I feel like I am happy in my skin, I feel closest to that young kid, playing in the mud and running around with the dog with my little sister.

But puberty hit and I began to feel... weird. Weird all of the time. There was a lot going on in my life, but as my body began to change, people began to treat me differently. From puberty to now, I began to have a recurrent gender crisis (though I didn't know that's what it was until many years later). I began to feel like my clothes, my body, none of it suited me. I would throw out all my feminine clothes and try to do my best to be a boy, as I knew it- unfortunately a lot of that was based on my own internalized misogyny and gender roles. It didn't quite suit me, and then I would feel at odds with myself once again, because I was trying to cram myself into another place that didn't suit me.

In recent years I have begun to feel that being in a gender and self expression flux is not just a symptom of my anxiety- that there is a reason that every 6 months I begin to feel desperately out of place in my own skin. So began my own journey into understanding myself. 

As it stands, my journey of trying to understand who I was looks a lot like this- straight, tomboy, lesbian, tomboy, androgynous, trying to be a boy, trying to be a girl, lesbian?? Bi, straight, cis, tomboy again, oh my god am I trans??? Wash, rinse, repeat. A lot of that exploration helped me get closer to who I thought I was, but just as much it gave me feelings of depression and self-loathing- I didn't know it, but I had jumped out of one box (straight, cis female) only to try to put myself in another, and I didn't fit.

As I've come to understand gender theory and the whole gender-sex-attraction thing, I feel like I'm starting to get closer to becoming that person on the inside. It's hard. There's a lot of difficulty, frustration, and pain. But I know that the alternative is even worse.

34 years old/CA/not really a baby girl skunk, I was just looking at pictures of baby skunks when I made the user name. Aww.

Anyway.

So I've made a lot of progress in the past couple of days. I asked some questions on here at this sub as well as the Ask Transgender sub and Genderqueer, about low-dose T, top surgery, and all that. People have been really helpful which is great. I live in the Bay Area so I called the Pacific Center yesterday and will be going to a group therapy session/meeting for genderqueer and non-binary folks this coming week. 

Then I called Lyon Martin, an LGBTQ+ health clinic, and got an appointment for medical care for next month as well as left a voicemail for their mental health department to get a gender therapist.

THEN, today, I spoke with Dr. Mosser's surgery clinic about top surgery and scheduled a free consultation for June because YOLO. 

So I did all this and I've been trying to open up to people in my life a little more about how I'm feeling. On some level I feel this weird sort of giddy liberation. And I'm probably just emotionally exhausted after taking all these giant steps, but for whatever reason, instead of feeling happy and positive and liberated to be figuring this shit out, I also just feel:

1. sad that I didn't do this sooner.
2. sad that I feel this way at all.
3. sad that it's gotten worse over the years instead of better.
4. cheated out of a real childhood (I am FAAB and hit puberty at basically age 10, so there went that. got my period and then started growing boobs and I hated it and just felt like I would never be the same).
5. exhausted by the hat0rade I have run across on the Internet about gender-variant folks.
6. terrified of telling my parents any of this, yet feeling like I should include them in at least SOME statement about, ""Hi, I don't really think of myself as being 100% female and never have. It's okay if you keep calling me my name and using female pronouns and calling me your daughter because I am okay with being those things to you and I love you. But I just wanted to tell you my real feelings because I did not want to leave you completely out of such an important part of my life.""
7. really worried that there is something else chemically off with me that's somehow causing this, like borderline personality disorder or something. Or some manic episode or PMDD. I have not been diagnosed with any of these things but I am just not trusting my own feelings all of a sudden. Like what if I'm wrong about all this? What if I go back?

But I can't go back.

And god dammit, why should I, so I can keep being miserable and dysphoric and weird about everything for ANOTHER 20 years? Aw hell no.

So why can't I just be happy that I'm on this journey? Why am I so afraid?

Sometimes I think I could be happy being seen as something that's a ""girl"" but doesn't fall into the categories of cis or AMAB transitioning to female.

There are some other aspects of myself that, upon reflection, have felt like confirmation, and a couple people I spoke to said I\'ve read as nonbinary to them in various ways. \n\nI have no problem being feminine (though I\'m increasingly uncomfortable with the label \'woman\' and prefer femme) as an AFAB person. I just want to do it without breasts. And I\'m not sure what exactly that means for me. \n\nThere\'s a part of me that\'s afraid I just want to be ""special,"" and that if I was really nonbinary or genderqueer I should have known it before now.

A group of friends have been organizing a get together yearly in NC. About half of the attendees are from the state. Many, including myself, are from out of state. A number of us have been discussing not attending the gathering this year, but the truth is that this is only likely to hurt the person who has already shelled out money to organize the event. Rescheduling or relocating is not an option.

Our group is primarily but not exclusively men, mostly straight.

Some of us had been floating the idea of finding a way to show solidarity while we are down there. We will be in Chapel Hill, a relatively liberal area of the state and were seeking an event to attend, but there did not seem to be anything happening while we were there.

Some people had also floated the idea of showing up for a day of the event in drag as a lighthearted way to raise awareness for people who were local and to publicly show our support. My initial reaction is that this seems inherently... offensive? (opinions needed here). Unless we are representing something about ourselves it seems callous/insensitive for us to do this, especially knowing that we will get some laughs or eye-rolls from the situation, whatever our intentions are. 

I spoke to a trans friend who said, if you ""have"" to go, don't buy any of your food there or patronize any businesses. Its something worth considering but would have a significant impact in our regular plans.

There's nothing wrong with them, most have been worn no more than 3 times or never at all and just aren't my color or I have a similar color. 

I remember what it was like getting into makeup and how much you had to experiment with colors and such, and I was thinking I could post here and might be able to help out!

I have sanitized them all by spraying them with alcohol, wiping away the top layer that my lips would have touched, and and spraying with alcohol again. You wouldn't have to be worried about my cooties.

Anyways, they're free to a good home. I would just ask that you pay shipping. Just let me know which ones you want, first come first served!

I remember what it was like getting started in makeup and how overwhelming it was, so if you have any questions about any of these let me know. No makeup question is a dumb makeup question! You can google the colors to see what they look like

* ~~OOC lip Primer~~

I'm French and currently working on a research project on the **perception by EU LGBT of their rights situation in their country**. 

Every year, [The Rainbow Index](http://www.ilga-europe.org/resources/rainbow-europe/2015) publishes a report which ranks each EU country based on their handling of LGBT rights and issues. I want to find out whether these results reflect reality. I would love it if you could help me do that.

If you live in **any European country** and you're interested in giving me a hand (hehe) for this project, here are questions you should answer (you can PM me your answers if you'd rather):

You can access the [survey here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/898XBPT)

* 1- How do you **perceive** the state of LGBT rights in your country? (Let me know how you feel on a daily basis at home and **where you are from**)

* 2- How do you **reach this perception**? (What means do you use: personal experiences, social media, news, organisations...)

* 3- Are you **familiar with** the Rainbow Index?

If there is anything else you'd like to add, please feel free to do so! 

A million thanks and hoping to hear from all of you soon! Don't hesitate to ask questions.

So... I've been transitioning for 6 months, that is on HRT for 6 months, I wanted to have my body and hormones change as I adjusted... plus with my physique being really tall.... I kinda felt like it would help with my transitioning into being a girl full time, and it has.

But recently I've been having a hard time feeling feminine.... like... during the day I dress up like a guy (sorta, I still have painted nails and a hairband to keep my hair back) and when I have time and I'm know going anywhere I wear female clothes... I can feel feminine at times... but most of the time I just feel.... ""Bleh""... like I'm not really even human in a sense.... worse is when I feel like a man.... it doesn't help because I have a gut too.... even worse... I have a regurgitation reaction when I try to eat vegetables.... well most of them, like broccoli, lettuce, spinach, etc.

So I guess my questions are these:
1) Any tips on feeling more feminine?
2) Any tips on targeting the stomach area without risking building up bulk?
3) Any tips on how to start eating salads?

1,2016-04-01 04:47:09,4ctzk7,13,14,"(Posted this in /r/asktransgender yesterday but didn't really get any replies so I'll post it here instead. Hope that's OK.)

I'm not sure about the exact label yet but I'm pretty sure I'm agender (or some kind of strange mixture of man and woman, but most likely agender) and I feel like I should probably tell my boyfriend about it. We've been together for many years now and even though I've thought about both my gender identity and sexuality for years, it's not until the past half a year that I've really been questioning, doing research, and learning about these parts of myself. Last month I told my boyfriend I'm probably bisexual and that was scary enough. Telling him that I'm non-binary seems *even scarier*.

How do I tell my boyfriend, who thinks of me as a woman, that I don't really identify as a woman? I have no problem with female pronouns but *I don't feel like a woman*. Not entirely anyway. There's some kind of indescribable disconnect between my assigned sex/gender and how I really feel. How do I tell my boyfriend, who likes my female body, that a big goal of mine is to one day go through a breast reduction (not remove them completely) so that I can look more androgynous? It will sound absolutely *ridiculous* to someone who isn't familiar with the world of non-binary (it's still difficult for *me* to fully understand it all, and I *am* non-binary).

And then there's this tiny ""voice"" in the back of my mind that tells me I'm probably imagining everything and that I'm as cisgender as can be. Stupid thought since I got happy when someone thought I was a boy when I was 10 years old and since I remember asking myself *""why don't I feel like a woman?""* as far back as 13 years ago.

I never learned about everything that isn't cisgender when I grew up and honestly didn't educate myself on the matter until 6 months ago, which is crazy. I've referred to myself as ""mentally androgynous"" for *years* (though that's not the correct term) without knowing there is actually a name for what I've felt my whole life. Learning about all of this has made me feel really confused and anxious but at the same time liberated in some way. It's like my world view has broadened and like I suddenly feel like it's OK to be me. Does that make sense? I'd like to share that with my boyfriend (I also think he has the right to know), but I'm scared of how he's going to react.

Any advice?

Also, I feel like I should add two things: 1) I don't want to transition since I don't identify as male (though I'd rather be male if I could choose). I do, however, want to keep dressing androgynously and I want to have a breast reduction. 2) I came out as non-binary for the first time ever a couple of days ago. I told a good friend of mine and she was great about it. Doubt my boyfriend will be as understanding as she was.

2,2016-04-01 22:55:26,4cyokj,20,8,"My partner and I really enjoy watching cartoons together, because they're easy to fit into our schedules and they're a nice way to relax and enjoy something together. However, we've found it pretty common for these sorts of shows to have really uncomfortable, unnecessary, and/or stereotypical gender references that really jar us and make it hard to enjoy the show. Do you all have suggestions towards cartoons (or similar media) in which this isn't the case?

Positive example: we really liked Steven Universe and are eagerly awaiting new episodes. Gender exists in the show, but is rarely referenced and almost never in context of stereotypes. There is a character that is pretty clearly nonbinary, which is cool.

Negative examples:

1. In Gravity Falls, one of the villians (Gideon) is male but is consistantly derided by some of the main characters (esp. Stan) for acting and looking ""girly"". Additionally, one of the early episodes has one of the main characters (Dipper) being upset and made-fun-of for not being ""manly"".   
2. In Avatar: The Last Airbender, one of the main characters (Sokka) often makes comments about not expect not expecting ""girls"" to be good warriors and generally reinforces stereotypical gender roles. Even when he is proven wrong (e.g. is captured by a group of female warriors), it feels awkward and unnecessary that this is used as a source of comic relief.

I gave the examples that I did because these were particularly surprising/annoying to me, as these are popular and highly praised shows. I know there are a lot that are much worse about this, but the fact that I otherwise like a lot about Avatar and Gravity Falls makes it partiularly upsetting that I can't enjoy them properly because of their gender references.

First would like to say that love you and I think you are fantastic parents. I don’t know how else to say this then to get down to the truth that is I am Genderqueer, (more specifically agender) . As you have been having issue with my gender for a while and this what I have concluded I felt like this me your child and this my gender.
What is Genderqueer? 
Genderqueer (GQ), also termed non-binary or gender-expansive, is acatch-all category for gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or feminine—identities which are thus outside of the gender binary and cisnormativity. Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:
•	having an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity; 
•	having two or more genders (being bigender, trigender, orpangender);
•	having no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); This is me
•	moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); 
•	being third gender or other-gendered, a category which includes those who do not place a name to their gender
(source: Wikipedia)
  
Will this change me in anyway as your child?
As your child, no I am still the same person as yesterday. No this does not change me in anyway

Will I do anything to change my appearance in any way? 
At this moment no, expect grow my hair out and that about it for now. In the future I might go on hormones but that would still be a couple years away. In the meantime, (so like the next year) I might change passport gender and name and that is it. I might dress more femininely however probably not around you guys as it awkward for you (I would, so when I am back in New Zealand. As identify more towards femininity. 

I am Trans? 
Yes, however as I will tell I am agender, I don’t identify as either however I am more inclined towards femininity.
 
Is this Phase? 
No, I have felt consciously that I am trans (yet not knowing exactly where I was on the gender spectrum) for the last 4 years however unconsciously I have always felt different from the gender I was born with.  

I am transsexual? 
No, and no I am probably never getting sex change operation, it not for me. 

Could I change my mind? 
Unlikely, however yes, it does happen and if it does then I will face that obstacle when it comes. 

What pronoun and name to use? 
I know this may be difficult for you guys and probably will cause you guys the most animosity however, I would greatly respect if you called me G from now on and you either used Gender Neutral pronouns (They and them) or female (her and she). Even though it would deeply upset me and disappoint me, I would understand if guys still used male pronoun and called me George. However again it would deeply upset and disappoint me   
     
Do I know it is Hard? 
Yes, I do for both sides. I know you worry that this makes me a target for to pick on, however I thought about this hard and carefully for 8 months when I came to conclusion that I am genderqueer. I have thought about the pros and cons and I think in end this better for overall happiness, as I would rather not pretend to be something I am not.  

What now? 
Nothing, you know what I would like that can ask you for to respect my wishes and I hope this covered what you need to know however if you any more questions, I am happy to answer them and if you want more information. I can give you a couple websites. But you have to come and ask me about it. I won’t chase you about this letter. If you would you could forget that this letter ever existed however again this would deeply upset me and disappoint me.
I am also more than happy to bring this wish up with My psychiatrist in the next session. And no she does not know about this letter, we don’t really talk about it much.

Genderqueer people may identify as one or more of the following:\n•\thaving an overlap of, or indefinite lines between, gender identity; \n•\thaving two or more genders (being bigender, trigender, orpangender);\n•\thaving no gender (being agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); This is me\n•\tmoving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); \n•\tbeing third gender or other-gendered, a category which includes those who do not place a name to their gender\n(source: Wikipedia)\n  \nWill this change me in anyway as your child?\nAs your child, no I am still the same person as yesterday. No this does not change me in anyway\n\nWill I do anything to change my appearance in any way? \nAt this moment no, expect grow my hair out and that about it for now.

However, I'm still learning about a lot of things related to gender, sexuality, etc. and I may perhaps word something in a way that may or may not be the most precise or effective - and if I offend anyone, I apologize! Teach me! 

Alright, disclaimer out of the way, I have recently - as recently as this weekend - matched with another person on an app and I find them really attractive. To bring context to this, I'm a cisgender, straight male. I'm looking to find a lovely girl to spend time with and shower with adoration, lol. However, this person I matched with had genderqueer in their profile, but I didn't really mind. You see my mind just focused on their appearance at the time. When we started talking I wanted to be respectful so the first thing I did was ask what pronouns I may use to refer to them (which, to quote this person, got me bonus points haha). The response I am not sure what to think about or how to respond to - he refers to himself as he, and not she. 

So here I am - I need advice. This isn't the first time something similar like this happened to me, but I'm really interested in this person and I don't know what to feel or think?? I have a lot of questions. Last semester I took a class on gender, sexuality, sex, etc. and learned a lot. It was really eye opening and tough to go through, coming from a heteronormative society teaching one thing and suddenly being exposed to new concepts and ideas that go contrary to what I've grown up understanding and feeling. I am burning with questions. 

I'd like to first verify my understanding - sex refers to the physical assignment of an individual based on characteristics like the presence of specific genetailia or body features; gender is the mental concept one has of oneself - how they see themselves and how they identify. Third, presentation is how one chooses to present themselves outwardly, through action, dress, etc. and it need not conform to their sex or gender. Sexual orientation is one's sexual preference or attraction - a tendency towards femininity or masculinity.

Please correct my understanding if I'm wrong above - it's probably important I get my knowledge right before I make assumptions. 

Anyway, back to my problem. My biggest one - how does the concept of sexual orientation hold in a landscape where gender identity isn't cut and dry? Is sexual orientation at all concerned with gender, or is it purely a physical thing?? 

I don't understand how to react to my situation - I am attracted to this person because what my brain sees in his pictures is a beautiful girl. But he tells me to refer to him as a he. What does that make me?? Am I straight because I'm attracted to the feminine qualities of the individual? Or does his label put a spin on who I am?? Furthermore how should I proceed? What if I end up really liking this person? He'll want me to continue using the 'he' pronoun, but I don't feel comfortable with the idea of telling my parents or friends oh yeah, I'm dating this person and they identify as male. Naturally then the question falls on what that makes me - but I genuinely don't now or ever have had an attraction to men. Nor do I ever intend on being with a man. But my eyes don't see a guy, I see a girl! And I'm afraid that makes me a bad person but I can't help it - so now I'm thinking like what does it even mean to be one or the other- and like how do labels like ""gay"" or ""straight"" even exist in a context where masculine individuals can identify as girls and feminine individuals can  identify as males. It takes all meaning out of the statement ""I'm not into dudes"" doesn't it?

Only problem is I don't know if I'll ever medically transition. Every time I go on HRT it makes me doubtful (on a low dose at the moment and I'm still having moments where I consider stopping). Gotta discuss this with the gender therapist I suppose.
It just makes me feel like a big old phony that I'm not sure what I want for myself and yet I still feel like a woman and a lesbian, but I'm okay with my body to an extent? The extent being I don't want any further masculine development, but if I could be a super androgynous dude shaped person then maybe I'd be okay with myself? The other alternative is that I'm a super androgynous woman shaped person, but i don't know.

Also lately I've been getting anxiety and I'm not sure if it's because I have small boobs and wish I had no boobs, or if it's because I have small boobs and want them to be more complete.

HRT is just another form of confusing at the moment :'( but I don't want to stop my low dose E because I don't want that masculinisation I was talking about.

34 years old/CA/not really a baby girl skunk, I was just looking at pictures of baby skunks when I made the user name. Aww.
Anyway.
So I've made a lot of progress in the past couple of days. I asked some questions on here at this sub as well as the Ask Transgender sub and Genderqueer, about low-dose T, top surgery, and all that. People have been really helpful which is great. I live in the Bay Area so I called the Pacific Center yesterday and will be going to a group therapy session/meeting for genderqueer and non-binary folks this coming week.
Then I called Lyon Martin, an LGBTQ+ health clinic, and got an appointment for medical care for next month as well as left a voicemail for their mental health department to get a gender therapist.
THEN, today, I spoke with Dr. Mosser's surgery clinic about top surgery and scheduled a free consultation for June because YOLO.
So I did all this and I've been trying to open up to people in my life a little more about how I'm feeling. On some level I feel this weird sort of giddy liberation. And I'm probably just emotionally exhausted after taking all these giant steps, but for whatever reason, instead of feeling happy and positive and liberated to be figuring this shit out, I also just feel:
sad that I didn't do this sooner.
sad that I feel this way at all.
sad that it's gotten worse over the years instead of better.
cheated out of a real childhood (I am FAAB and hit puberty at basically age 10, so there went that. got my period and then started growing boobs and I hated it and just felt like I would never be the same).
exhausted by the hat0rade I have run across on the Internet about gender-variant folks.
terrified of telling my parents any of this, yet feeling like I should include them in at least SOME statement about, ""Hi, I don't really think of myself as being 100% female and never have. It's okay if you keep calling me my name and using female pronouns and calling me your daughter because I am okay with being those things to you and I love you. But I just wanted to tell you my real feelings because I did not want to leave you completely out of such an important part of my life.""
really worried that there is something else chemically off with me that's somehow causing this, like borderline personality disorder or something. Or some manic episode or PMDD. I have not been diagnosed with any of these things but I am just not trusting my own feelings all of a sudden. Like what if I'm wrong about all this? What if I go back?
But I can't go back.
And god dammit, why should I, so I can keep being miserable and dysphoric and weird about everything for ANOTHER 20 years? Aw hell no.
So why can't I just be happy that I'm on this journey? Why am I so afraid?

41,2016-04-10 16:12:15,4e6cnh,18,18,"Hey there :) I'm 28, MTF.

I found out about this whole transgender thing in December. At first I had some resistance but then... Well, last month I got started with the lasering, got an androgynous-ish style haircut, scheduled a medic appointment to see about HRT. I've discussed things with my wife (we have no idea about the future but our hearts are in the right place), I planned my future wardrobe, and picked a female name I like.

But then it hit me: 

* I'll be going from cis-white-guy to the most picked on demographic there is. 

* I'm good looking now and who knows, I might turn out a rather ugly lady on the other side. 

* I'll have a pile of legal issues with regards to the name change (yay third world). 

* There's a good chunk of family I'm sure will write me off as dead after all this.

* As a woman I better brush up on my self defense skills.

* In the future if I'm ever dating or looking for a job... good luck.

I could go on forever. 

All of this got me wondering. Why is it that so much of my well being is tied to whether I look like a man or a woman? Intellectually it makes no sense to me. I've discussed this with both my wife and my therapist, and the best we could come up with was that it's a self-esteem issue. It still makes no sense to me. It sounds so shallow and superficial. It's not who I am to put looks on top of the list so much. (Which I almost did on the list above, I know.) I don't get it.

After (*if?*) I'm 100% passable some of the problems will hopefully disappear and I'll just blend in with the crowd. But I don't know. I'm scared.

I'm Jamie Tristan Folaigh, or at least that's what I'm feeling right now. All three names are ""fictions"" though, with one being a last name specifically created for social media purposes.

I'm 26, AMAB, and genderfluid, pronouns don't matter. I'm clearly AMAB if you see me in person, but I don't always identify with ""he/him"" pronouns, hence the username (genderfluid*chick*, I strongly prefer the idea of expressing myself typically middle ground, but having a center that is more feminine of center than masculine of center, if that makes sense).

I've always felt like I didn't connect fully with guys or girls in a consistent manner. My first big indication that I was different was, at a young age, like six, I distinctly remember that I didn't like the word ""handsome"" being applied to me. Looking back at old photos, there might be a slight confirmation bias being applied, but I can see why kids might have wondered if I was gay or something.

I know that I'm not gay, not because I can't find guys attractive, I just can't see myself sleeping with one. In that same vein, I don't recall looking at girls the same way I remember hearing guys talk about them.

For as long as I can remember, I have found things like girls jeans and underwear to be more comfortable, and have desired a more middle-ground or even slightly feminine presentation (like, sometimes, using girly tops or skirts and stuff). I know that pushing the envelope too far is impossible given certain physical attributes I have (thinning hair, kinda masculine shoulder build, kinda masculine face).

Perhaps the biggest things that block me from pushing the envelope too far are the aforementioned physical issues (which aren't that big a deal in the long run) for one. For another there is the fact that my social network is composed entirely of people who know me as a guy and would probably be destroyed if I was to come out in this manner. That and the idea that, even though I am not too far from Atlanta, I am far enough from it that people (including potential romantic interests) would tend to not be interested in me (and, I feel, potentially aggressive) if I was to come out in this manner.

That and the idea that, even though I am not too far from Atlanta, I am far enough from it that people (including potential romantic interests) would tend to not be interested in me (and, I feel, potentially aggressive) if I was to come out in this manner.\n\nSo yeah, I guess you could consider this Me 3.0, Me 1.0 is birth me, Me 2.0 is thinking that I may be trans and wanting to be a girl full time, Me 2.1 is my old Reddit account, Me 2.2 is exploring the idea of genderfluidity, and Me 3.0 is, even in the closet, fully embracing gendefluidity and hopefully building a future life as this person.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Hey there everyone [x-post /r/genderfluid]', 'created': 1460342688.0}"

I'm currently on low AAs and low E. And while that's great. My itty bitty titties do on occasion give me anxiety and make me worry about them getting bigger. 

The alternative is to go on a tiny (and potentially ineffectual) level of AAs or stop completely. I tried a lowish dose of AAs for a while and all i got were hot flushes, a short temper and mood swings. 

I'm afraid of stopping altogether because i honestly can't remember how i felt when i wasn't surpressing T. I remember being horny a lot but that was about it. Also, masculinising isn't my idea of a super fun time. 

So I'm kind of stuck. I kind of have to come to terms with either solution. Unless SERMs become an option, but I'm not holding my breath.

66,2016-04-16 03:12:01,4f08eb,3,18,"Hi everyone. FAABulous, genderqueer (transmasculine) 34 years young. I work in IT on a pretty small team for a Bay Area tech company. My manager and I have a good rapport and have had some pretty deep conversations in the past. Because of everything I've been questioning/going through, I decided maybe I should just say something and get it over with. So um, I did. It was far from my usual eloquence and poise, but I didn't burst out sobbing and when we were wrapping up our conversation, he said he was thankful and honored that I trusted him to talk about this stuff with him, and then asked if there was anything I needed at this point. I said I'm still feeling that out, but thanked him for asking. 

I'm simultaneously overjoyed, scared to death, and profoundly grateful that we live in a society which is slowly learning to accept this. I also feel so exhausted. Is it normal to be like, COMPLETELY WIPED OUT when you first start figuring these things out about yourself? I could seriously sleep for days, yet I also feel sort of jittery and almost euphoric and definitely relieved. It's weird as hell. I identified as FTM almost 10 years ago and then got scared and went back in the goddamn closet for pretty much the worst 10 years of my life. I keep worrying that what if this is just a ""phase"" again?

Is it normal to have flashes of, ""maybe/what if I'm wrong?"" to worry about what others will think or how it'll turn out, to worry you won't be the same and that you're changing a part of yourself that isn't ""supposed"" to be changed? Is it normal to be afraid? 

Please tell me your Coming Out At Work/To Family stories, especially if you consider yourself non-binary/genderqueer. I'm kinda overwhelmed by how much more real this feels now. And I am TERRIFIED of telling my parents, that's the other thing. 

On a positive note, I think I may have finally found a therapist! I just have to call them back.

91,2016-04-19 21:58:48,4fk0vm,35,34,"(Excuse the long off-my-chest post as I try to write my feelings out for myself.)

I'm baffled by gender and I'm baffled by my identity.

I'm female and I like girls. I'm 22. I've never understood what it means to be a woman or feel like one. I've also never really understood what it means to be a man. Everyone I know easily (and sometimes strongly) identifies with their sex, gender, and sexuality and I feel like I'm left out, confused, and frustrated.

I want to be one or the either but I feel stifled and conflicted and depressed when I'm forced into one box or the other. I don't want to go by alternative pronouns and be referred to as some ""other"".

But when people refer to me as a girl I feel awkward. They're not wrong... But they're not quite right either? I'm completely fine with being identified as a daughter and a sister, but being a girl and a woman is something weird and almost distant to me. It's not the social roles or expectations of girls/women that bother me as some people have asked me -- I don't give a flying fuck about those and have disregarded them from the time I was little (""I do what I want, bitch"" is generally my philosophy).

When I was in middle/high school I thought I was FtM transgender. If I wasn't a girl, surely I was a boy? My parents sent me to a counselor (not to punish me, but so that I could talk through my feelings and due to other depression-related reasons) and I was talked into? identifying as a lesbian.

So I carried along in my high school years as a fairly closeted ""butchy"" lesbian still fairly uncomfortable with myself but happier that I had some kind of label. I still felt awkward about my body (particularly my chest), about using the bathrooms and locker-rooms, and being assigned in girl-boy arrangements.

And then here comes college. I go away from my home in little ol' Vermont to Montana to try and catch a breath of fresh air and some change. Without my mother's nitpicking on what I wear I bought a new wardrobe of masculine/men's clothing, a proper binder (or two), and for the first time in a while felt more content and happy with myself looking how I wanted to look. I was still in the closet to the outside world regarding anything and everything but I joined the university's queer alliance club and finally got to interact with more than just a handful of LGBTQ identifying folk. I didn't know how to identify myself to the group and shirked away from any further labels but I made a few friends. People within the group assumed I was FtM transgender due to the way I dressed, talked, and carried myself however I shied away from identifying myself as such. I wasn't a butch lesbian because lesbians, even butch, intrinsically identify as women but I didn't quite feel transgender either as I didn't really care about what was between my legs and if people referred to me as male or female.

I had to leave Montana and come back to Vermont as I couldn't cope with the harassment I was experiencing. My parents were more accepting of how I presented myself (not that they never didn't accept me, but I think my mom had difficulty accepting her oldest daughter wasn't the feminine princess she had when I was 2-6 years old). I was happy doing whatever the fuck I wanted.

This past year I tried, I really really tried, experimenting with my femininity. I grew my hair out for the first time since I was 9 years old. I dabbled in make-up. I bought more feminine clothing. It was fun, don't get me wrong, to play with make-up and make myself look like this bizarre foreign being and dressing up in pretty clothes. I don't mind too much wearing dresses to formal/business events as long as the dress is ""my style"" (conservative, plain, solid colors, a-line). But what I didn't realize until I cut my hair short again recently is that every time I looked in the mirror I was looking at a stranger. A pretender. I don't know how to describe it, it's not like hair or dressing a certain way should really *matter* if I'm happy with myself or know who I am, but it didn't make me feel like me and it made me depressed. It was fun for a while and then it became a burden and an expectation.

I cut my hair short again and I looked in the mirror. There was the boy-ish androgynous face I knew looking back at me. My hair cut and styled how I always had it. A sports bra to diminish my breasts and a dumb t-shirt. There was me again. But at the same time... What am I?

I feel like a nothing. Like a blank person. I tell my friends that ""I'm just me!"" but feeling like you have no real identity sucks, as much as I claim not to care. I just want to be happy saying I'm a guy or a girl and not terribly conflicted and confused about what it means.",genderqueer,What the hell is gender?,1461128328.0,"{'created_utc': 1461103128, 'id': '4fk0vm', 'num_comments': 35, 'score': 34, 'selftext': '(Excuse the long off-my-chest post as I try to write my feelings out for myself.)\n\nI\'m baffled by gender and I\'m baffled by my identity.\n\nI\'m female and I like girls.

People within the group assumed I was FtM transgender due to the way I dressed, talked, and carried myself however I shied away from identifying myself as such. I wasn\'t a butch lesbian because lesbians, even butch, intrinsically identify as women but I didn\'t quite feel transgender either as I didn\'t really care about what was between my legs and if people referred to me as male or female.\n\nI had to leave Montana and come back to Vermont as I couldn\'t cope with the harassment I was experiencing. My parents were more accepting of how I presented myself (not that they never didn\'t accept me, but I think my mom had difficulty accepting her oldest daughter wasn\'t the feminine princess she had when I was 2-6 years old). I was happy doing whatever the fuck I wanted.\n\nThis past year I tried, I really really tried, experimenting with my femininity. I grew my hair out for the first time since I was 9 years old. I dabbled in make-up. I bought more feminine clothing. It was fun, don\'t get me wrong, to play with make-up and make myself look like this bizarre foreign being and dressing up in pretty clothes. I don\'t mind too much wearing dresses to formal/business events as long as the dress is ""my style"" (conservative, plain, solid colors, a-line). But what I didn\'t realize until I cut my hair short again recently is that every time I looked in the mirror I was looking at a stranger. A pretender. I don\'t know how to describe it, it\'s not like hair or dressing a certain way should really *matter* if I\'m happy with myself or know who I am, but it didn\'t make me feel like me and it made me depressed. It was fun for a while and then it became a burden and an expectation.\n\nI cut my hair short again and I looked in the mirror. There was the boy-ish androgynous face I knew looking back at me. My hair cut and styled how I always had it. A sports bra to diminish my breasts and a dumb t-shirt. There was me again. But at the same time... What am I?\n\nI feel like a nothing. Like a blank person. I tell my friends that ""I\'m just me!"" but feeling like you have no real identity sucks, as much as I claim not to care. I just want to be happy saying I\'m a guy or a girl and not terribly conflicted and confused about what it means.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'What the hell is gender?', 'created': 1461128328.0}"

Hell, it wasn’t until I lost a bet that I ended up being unwillingly dressed up as a princess for Halloween. They put on a bunch of makeup, curled my hair, gave me a hot pink outfit, painted my nails hot pink to match, and gave me a tiara.

That was the most fucking uncomfortable Halloween I’ve ever had.

So yeah. It’s no wonder I spent the following few years identifying and expressing as genderfuck. Because holy shit, what a frustrating and toxic environment.

* Emo
* Long hair with no bangs, layering, or other styling

I've found myself in a weird place, and I have a feeling you fine folks can help me out.

I'm AFAB agender, and I'm struggling to present myself in a suitably androgynous way.  I have a lot going for me in this department - I'm slim, my facial features are rather androgynous, and I've worked on my body posture and voice that they're fairly inbetweeny.

My issue is my breasts.  And I know what you're thinking!  ""Wear a binder, dummy!"" Yeah, yeah, I know.  I hear you.  I've shopped around, read a lot about them.  They seem fantastic and they would suit my purposes wonderfully. BUT!  But.  I like my breasts.  They're small unobtrusive bouncy fun balls.  And I can cover them up easily enough with loose clothes.  But I hate the idea of covering them up.  I dunno...I was SO HAPPY to get them in the first place!  They're pretty much my favorite thing about being a phenotypical girl.

So I feel like this weird sense of betrayal in squishing them down and hiding them.  But if I don't, I get read as a girl.

Is there anyone here who identifies as fluid but doesn't get bad dysphoria?  I've heard of people having panic attacks and things like that.  It's not like that for me.  I feel wrong sometimes, but I still get by and get through the day.  Does this mean I'm not really fluid, that my gender identity is actually static and not that far off from my body, and I just haven't identified what it is?

When I'm feeling more strongly feminine, it can make me uncomfortable, especially around mirrors or in the bathroom.  I am just not seeing the person I want to see.  Being around other women makes me really self-conscious about how I don't look like them, and there's that nagging voice in the back of my head that tells me it's futile to even try.  ""You are NOT a woman and you never will be.  Give it up, just admit you're a man.""  If I can keep busy (like diving into code at work), it's not too bad, but if I get away from that I can start to feel distracted or nervous.  I sometimes find myself pacing around daydreaming about my female self.  I can still function, though, it's just not a fun day.

This manifested yesterday when I was shopping for clothes in the women's section.  Picking stuff off the rack I felt like a kid in a candy store (side note: I finally understand why a lot of women love shopping for clothes and shoes), but I found myself deliberately avoiding any mirrors so I wouldn't see the hairy flat-chested little goblin intruding on women's spaces.  When I went to try things on, that was the worst.  Even if I liked the clothes, I felt hideous.  I didn't see female me in the mirror, I just saw an ugly man trying on dresses.  I think part of it is that I still have a beard and body hair, and feminine me doesn't have those those things in my head.  That makes it hard to see her in the mirror.

Is this a form of dysphoria?  Or is it my brain just telling me that I'm cis, and I'm not listening?  Or is it just a plain old body image issue, like cis people face every day, and has nothing to do with my gender identity?  My male self definitely has those issues, but this is... different somehow.

I've struggled with feeling like a fraud, and like I'm just trying to convince myself I'm fluid so I have a fancy sounding label to justify things I might be subconsciously ashamed of.  My lack of dysphoria is one big thing that's holding me back from fully accepting being fluid.  I am also struggling to separate my identity from my body - I don't know if that's dysphoria in itself or just a sign that I'm cisgender.

About two months ago I was suffering from a lot of dysphoria and I felt like a freak because I wasn't ""full"" trans and I didn't really want to transition. So I looked up different resources and stats and stuff but that really didn't help, then I started looking up pictures of genderfluid people and I came across a random comic strip about genderfluidity. But it was really short and it helped a lot so I started scouring the net for any other genderfluid related comics and I finally found a comic called Rain. Rain is mainly about a MTF highschooler and her adventures but it also covers everything from genderfluidity to asexuality. The character that I really related to was Ky/Kylie, they are genderfluid and in my opinion very accurately depicted. So my point is that this comic really helped me and I hope you guys will find it helpful too.

I'm 26, AMAB, and genderfluid, pronouns don't matter. I'm clearly AMAB if you see me in person, but I don't always identify with ""he/him"" pronouns, hence the username (genderfluid*chick*, I strongly prefer the idea of expressing myself typically middle ground, but having a center that is more feminine of center than masculine of center, if that makes sense).

I've always felt like I didn't connect fully with guys or girls in a consistent manner. My first big indication that I was different was, at a young age, like six, I distinctly remember that I didn't like the word ""handsome"" being applied to me. Looking back at old photos, there might be a slight confirmation bias being applied, but I can see why kids might have wondered if I was gay or something.

I know that I'm not gay, not because I can't find guys attractive, I just can't see myself sleeping with one. In that same vein, I don't recall looking at girls the same way I remember hearing guys talk about them.

For as long as I can remember, I have found things like girls jeans and underwear to be more comfortable, and have desired a more middle-ground or even slightly feminine presentation (like, sometimes, using girly tops or skirts and stuff). I know that pushing the envelope too far is impossible given certain physical attributes I have (thinning hair, kinda masculine shoulder build, kinda masculine face).

Perhaps the biggest things that block me from pushing the envelope too far are the aforementioned physical issues (which aren't that big a deal in the long run) for one. For another there is the fact that my social network is composed entirely of people who know me as a guy and would probably be destroyed if I was to come out in this manner. That and the idea that, even though I am not too far from Atlanta, I am far enough from it that people (including potential romantic interests) would tend to not be interested in me (and, I feel, potentially aggressive) if I was to come out in this manner.

So yeah, I guess you could consider this Me 3.0, Me 1.0 is birth me, Me 2.0 is thinking that I may be trans and wanting to be a girl full time, Me 2.1 is my old Reddit account, Me 2.2 is exploring the idea of genderfluidity, and Me 3.0 is, even in the closet, fully embracing gendefluidity and hopefully building a future life as this person.",genderfluid,Hey there everyone.,1460288163.0,"{'created_utc': 1460262963, 'id': '4e4lgs', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 5, 'selftext': 'Consider this a kinda ""reintroduction"", I previously posted on Reddit under a different username, but I figured it would be for the best if I made a clean break from that name.

This is a bit of an introduction and question post...


My names Dave (Sophie is my fem name), I'm a 27 year old (born male). I recently started going out with a new girlfriend who is very open minded and I let her know that I had these feelings that I had a feminine side. She took me out shopping a few weeks ago and I've since had a few days as a girl (including going out in public for meals). I don't feel like I'm ready to 100% transition and right now I feel like a female some days and male other days, which led me to discover that I was likely gender fluid. It's so refreshing to finally get this out of my system and be open about who I am.


Now for the question, how did you guys come out to your work colleagues/family and how long did it take? I'm guessing just coming to work one day as Sophie might be a little too extreme?


I would love to connect with like minded people, so please feel free to message me privately.

Fast forward to now. After a lot of soul searching and such, I had come to terms that I'm transgendered, about a year or so ago, and I've been on hormones for almost 2 months. I've still been mostly identifying as genderfluid, although as of late, the more I hear the Him's and Sir's, the more I notice how I don't really appreciate it. Like everytime I hear a cashier give me the ""Have a good day sir"", it just seems to sound louder than the rest, and it just keeps ringing in my ears where I almost physically cringe away. It always leaves me in some metaphorical daze. 


Among friends I'm open to whatever pronouns they choose to use for me, and it's less of a 'i'm happy with what you use' and closer to a 'i honestly don't care because it's not a big deal'. But if it's strangers, family, people I don't know or barely know, it just hits me so much harder. I don't know how to describe it other than the way a friend says 'he' and the way someone else says 'he' is ages different. The way friends say 'he' sounds simply offhanded ways to refer to me, but the way strangers say 'he' sounds almost spiteful I'd go as far as to say. 


the whole reason I chose to identify as Genderfluid is because I personally did not care how I presented, or how others saw me. Gender wasn't a part of any equation, it wasn't relevant, never mattered, could not have existed for all I cared. It was just a way for someone to identify me for their own comfort. A way to have someone to refer to me that was easy for them. But now I'm feeling like it's not the same. As if something is different, even though nothing changed. I'm guessing simply my understanding of myself is what changed and I haven't actually changed, but just. It's more than a little confusing, obviously. 

I've been wondering if maybe I've been calling myself genderfluid under the impression that I felt more ""anything goes, I don't care because I'll be under that spectrum somewhere"", but now I'm starting to think that maybe I just misinterpreted it as ""I don't identify as anything really, but that just seems close enough because it's easier to explain""? 

I guess I'm just looking for outside opinions on the matter. Am I overthinking this? Am I not thinking ENOUGH about it? I'm worried that I might be special-snowflaking this even if I'm just really confused about basically everything. Does what I describe sound closer to genderfluid or something like agendered?

Yesterday was my orientation, and I sort of found myself cringing when the assistant manager printed my birth name out on my name tag. Of course, I don't blame her, I tend to be much more femme-presenting (I try to be neutral at most times, but the way people perceive it is more femme of course...), and it's not like she had any way of knowing that I don't usually go by my birth name, since that is what I put on the application (legal reasons, y'know?).

Do you think it would be appropriate to at least request that I go by my chosen (rather than legal) name? How would I go about bringing that up? And when, for that matter? I just started yesterday, and I didn't want to make things too complicated during my orientation.

Also, would it be appropriate to disclose my identity? If I were MTF I think it would be one thing, but nonbinary genders sorta tend to be overlooked. So if they don't understand/follow up with that it's not as big of a deal I guess, because I'm sort of used to it.

I just started yesterday, and I didn\'t want to make things too complicated during my orientation.\n\nAlso, would it be appropriate to disclose my identity? If I were MTF I think it would be one thing, but nonbinary genders sorta tend to be overlooked. So if they don\'t understand/follow up with that it\'s not as big of a deal I guess, because I\'m sort of used to it.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated, thank you &lt;3\n\nUPDATE: I asked and they were actually SUPER chill about it, like they said they once had a cashier go by ""Bear"" and someone else who will ONLY answer to ""Jean-Pierre."" And another person with another ridiculous name, but I don\'t remember. She just printed out a new label for my clock-in card and nametag and that was that, no issues.

C. Come out as genderfluid 
D. Something else?

49,2016-04-22 22:41:08,4g0wid,4,12,"Hey everyone, I just found this subreddit and it seems right up my alley... at least I think so!

I was born female and grew up loving lots of ""tomboy"" stuffs and only really enjoyed female societal norms when it came to wearing dresses (because who doesn't love not wearing pants in public sometimes!?). My gender was never really a thing I thought about, and although my mom had wanted a really girly girl, both of my parents were pretty good at not forcing me to be one thing or another. I was happy with my gender neutral self.

Things changed rather a lot come puberty time, though, when I found out that I would be a super curvy woman. It was pretty exciting at first, buying special clothes and starting to look like some grown ups do. Then I found out what else happens when people see those curves: they stop talking with you about books and video games and start asking you about boyfriends and makeup. I think I became a little less confident in myself and it was, at least partially, because of the way that people treat me now, post-puberty. It's so very different than what I experienced as a flat-as-a-board human.

I never really minded my body, boobs and all (although I still think it would be really cool if I could grow a full beard!), but the thing that makes me question my gender is my mind. I find myself connecting a lot more mentally with those of the masculine or even more ""neutral"" gender and tend to get stressed when hanging out with super feminine types for long periods of time. It really rustles my jimmies when strangers assume I prefer feminine things or have feminine traits, but I'm also fairly sure that would rustle any AFAB person's jimmies, so perhaps that isn't so weird.

TLDR: I don't think I have body dysmorphia, but it does bother me that my naturally super feminine body makes it harder to be outwardly gender neutral in our society.

Ok so gender fluid for me is being a boy and a girl, some days i feel feminine and some days i feel masculine, some days i even feel like i am both but mixed together. Most of the time i feel more like a boy than a girl and to answer most people's questions i was born a female. The ways how i show what gender i feel i will dress either more femininly or more masculinly. when i feel both a boy and a girl at the same time i will; wear my binder, wear a skirt, and wear no make-up. this way i am a confusin to society and people cant really tell what i am. 

What i would like to talk about is my story of how i came to discovour my gender. 
when i was younger, every since i can remember i didn't see people as girls and boys, i just saw everyone as people. i thought everyone was the same and i didn't see myself as a girl. I just saw everyone and myself as people. i kept thinking like this until my first year of high school, i was 11. High school was not a very nice place for me, i got bullied a lot because i didn't look really girly and i didn't wear make-up like all the popular girls in my class. This didn't really bother me because i moved to a new high school 3 months after i started. However the bullying at this school was worse. I did have one friend at the time and she is still my friend now, unfortunatly, because we were so close I got accused of being a lesbian, the funny thing is she actually came out as being a lesbian 2 years ago. Anyway i am getting off topic.
At first i thought that i was bisexual and nothing else, i actually regret telling people that because i later discovoured that i am pansexual and once again i was bullied for being ""bi"". I have to apologize to anyone who's education is set out in a different form than mine, i am British. So when i was in year 8 , my second year of high school, i had a wave of feeling like i was a boy, i didn't know what to do, i didn't know who i could talk to and i felt so unhappy with my body. I felt like this for a while, like 4 months. Then i felt female again, so i thought, ""it was just a phase"". I was happy that i wouldn't have to tell my family that i wanted to be a boy. In year 9 i started falling for a boy in the year below me, so i forced myself to be feminine because i wanted him to like me..fast forward to when we actually started dating, it turned out that he isn't straight and he loves me for who i am and supports me, we are still together now and have been for 2 years now. so next i started feeling like a mix of a boy and a girl. i did some research and even discovoured Ruby Rose. this is how i realised that i am gender fluid. Now my main aim is to slowely tell the close people in my life, my big sister, little brother and a couple of close friends know, but i am hoping i will become brave enough to tell my judgmental father who will hopefully accept and support his little princess/prince. 

I hope i have helped other people who are still searching for their gender and i hope this has also made people aware of gender fluid.

My whole life has been a battle between subconsciously making choices to look more feminine then consciously over masculinity myself so that I don't look like a clear male presenting as female (There is absolutely nothing wrong with that though I am just an all or nothing type of perfectionist). For example I made the choice when I was about 9 or 10 to grow out my hair and it has been long ever since but because of that I have done things to counteract how feminine of a trait that is. The biggest thing I have done is as soon as I could grow a beard (15-16) I did and I have had it for about 3-4 years straight now, it isn't very long (Like an inch or two) or big (Just on my chin) but it successfully makes it easy to identify that I am Biologically male presenting as such. The biggest issue with this is that I want to be more androgynous but I don't want to be a mixture of the two genders I want to be a solution (I just realized that this is the best way to describe it because in science a mixture is a combination of two or more substances that hold on to their physical properties like fruits and nuts in yogurt but a solution is a combination of two or more substances that dissolve into one substance kinda like juice crystals and water. For this analogy the crystals are the feminine side of me and the water is the masculine, they have separate physical properties when they are apart but together they clearly make juice. I hope this doesn't make absolutely no sense). For the record, this is how I personally want to express my gender, I am not saying that this is the right way for everyone and I think expressing yourself in whatever way you want is how to do it. So to get to the point I need to shave for a job I am going to apply for and I have been looking for an excuse to shave for a while but I still feel terrified that if I shave I will be made fun of again or mis-gendered as female when I am not trying to present as female, which for some people it is a compliment but for me it is a reminder that I can't even present male well enough and will always stick out like a sore thumb.
