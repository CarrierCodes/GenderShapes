I am currently dating a non-binary person who is biologically female, and we have been together for a few months now.  We have had a really harmonious relationship and are very open with each other about out problems and helping each other with them.

However lately I've been depressed about the relationship,  and while I still love this person to death I'm worried about my subconscious attitude towards the relationship. I'm constantly worrying about making the wrong move, which may be partially due to them being my first significant other but also just because I feel I need to be more cautious about what I say and do. This is tied in with the fact that despite the fact that I am completely supportive of my partners identity as a non-binary person, I still get pangs and the feeling that they should be she, and that that is unconsciously affecting my interactions with them.

This is not in my near future, but part of my dream for life is to have children, who are my biological children. My partner isn't really into the whole idea of children and much less bearing children, and although I don't know that we ultimately will end up in such a relationship but I always look ahead and I have a hard time seeing how we could ever work out in that respect.

I'm AFAB and going into high school this year. As if starting freshman year in high school isn't nerve wracking enough, I'm genderqueer and have some concerns.  
A little background information (This paragraph isn't necessary, but I kept it here in case others relate or have advice about other things as well): I've felt mentally androgynous all my life, and was lucky enough to become familiar with non-binary identities last year. My understanding of these identities was very vague at the time, but it was enough to know that it matched me. Since then, I've not only learned much more but transitioned my appearance to look more androgynous, which has made me more confident and comfortable in my own skin. I wear a binder and ambiguous clothing. Fast forward to recently, my frustration with being seen as a girl (social dysphoria) boiled over and I spent months on edge, overly-reinforcing my masculine attributes and snapping at the word ""lady"". Thankfully things have leveled out again and I'm comfortable. What I'm looking for is a few answered questions from some more experienced people. I know some of these are hard because they should be things I'm deciding, but I'd like more input.  
* First of all, what should I do about changing for gym? My parents say going to a separate room such as a bathroom would make me an outcast and segregate me from others. They think people would wonder about it and such. On the contrary, I wear a binder... I guess I could wear a tank top over it when I change. As long as I convince myself a ""girl's"" locker room is just another way of saying anyone-whose-biological-sex-is-female's locker room, I feel alright with using it.  
* How are things socially in High School? I've heard it's tougher in regards to drama and teasing. I feel like at the least people will call me gay behind my back because they don't know what to make of me(they did this at the end of 8th grade), and at the most I could be bullied or something. I just want to make my high school years as enjoyable as I can. I also worry if people will initially, if not always, be weary of interacting with me because I'm different.  
* Should I use a different name? The name I was given at birth is very feminine, and was the 2nd most popular girl name of my year. It's not too bad of a name... but last year I picked out a neutral name for myself that I adore, and my friends call me by it. I'm debating whether I should go through the trouble of getting all the teachers to call me by my new name, or just stick with my old one and keep the new one for friends. I guess ultimately I'd like to know if I should pass as an androgynous(in appearance) girl just to make my life easier until I get out of high school and have more freedom.  
Any other advice for surviving high school in general would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!

I don't know what I am. I'm not cis, but I'm not transgender either. At best, I feel like I'm a woman, a man, and neither of the two at the same time. My preference for physical representation would be as androgynous as possible, but I can't achieve that without surgery (I bind my breasts, but they're too large to be fully flattened - I'd like to have them removed or at least reduced). However, because I'm not transgender I obviously wouldn't be prescribed surgery by public health care due to incredibly strict regulations, and I can't afford to have it done at a private clinic.

0,2016-08-01 18:42:41,4vo1zo,8,11,"So let me give you my background. I was born male and am currently living as a cis male but to understand my story I have to begin from when I was much younger.

Somewhere around 1st grade I realized I was more comfortable being around my girl cousins I'd rather play with Barbies and doll houses than action figures and toy guns like my brothers. And my family never minded, I wasn't purchased any for myself but never scolded for playing with my cousins. And I began to realize I was different.

In second grade a new toy came out they were like mini makeup kits for girls to play with and boy did I want one. I saved up my allowance for a few weeks and asked my mom to take me to Kay-Bee toys to buy a toy. But when she saw what I was looking at she kind of harshly convinced me that those toys weren't for me. And that was the moment I not only realized that I didn't fit in with boys but felt that I needed to hide how I felt. 

Late in elementary school and beginning of junior high I began to understand that I had a gender identity issue but I was also painfully aware of gender norms and that if I came out of the closet I had a serious risk of being alienated so I kept it hidden. Even hiding I would often get picked on for being feminine and oddly enough the insult that was thrown at me that hurt the most was ""dyke"" because it was a reminder and a ridicule toward what I wished I was.

What was both a blessing and a curse for me was that I was attracted to women not men. It allowed me to have a ""normal"" dating life in Jr and Sr high without outing myself. But I never felt 100% fulfilled. 

Dating was also confusing for me because when I was younger it was really hard for me to figure out if I wanted to 'be' or 'be with' who ever I was currently crushing on.

As I got older and had serious relationships I would inform my significant other about my Identity issues and was lucky to be with people who were always accepting or at worst understanding never judged.

Fast forward to now I'm 29 years old living as a man, Married (happily I adore my wife) and a father(I love. While I'm happy with my life I sometimes just hurt over this. I feel I've lived as a man too long and couldn't handle the change.(I'm a creature of habit) but I always feel as if I live in a body that's not mine. 

My wife wants me to talk about this stuff with her but I don't always feel comfortable. It's a touchy subject for me as it is and when she asks me things I feel more like I'm being interviewed for a mix of entertainment and self assurance on her part not for my needs.

So I'm 22 and currently (outwardly) identify as male, though I've been fighting dysphoria more or less since I can remember.

I only went to therapy for a few months before extenuating circumstances meant I had to stop, and me still being pretty young and frankly very scared, I stopped altogether.  
  
I had never started HRT but I had forms and some clothes I wore when I could but living with my parents made that very difficult. Over the years I just suppressed everything as best I could and tried to move on. I was doing fairly well (as well as I could at least) until last year when things hit me hard again. I went thru a short phase, now that I'm on my own, where whenever I was home I'd wear forms and whatever I was comfortable with for clothes but I since had a bit of a mental breakdown after a particularly difficult day and threw everything away :( Ever since I've had those ups and downs where I would get really determined and then super defeated.  
  
In spite of this I'm slowly starting to try and face the problem again and work towards something healthy but when I look in the mirror all I can focus on is how 'manly' I look with my beard and being covered in body hair.

Non-binary: gender pronouns don't matter to me. I am going to be MtF hopefully soon. I'm excited and nervous as I'm not insured for it. I don't know how much it's all gonna cost or anything so that's scary to think about. But I'm so glad I finally get to fulfill my childhood dream of ""growing up to be a girl""! It's nice to meet you all.

I'm feeling a bit down because of dating. I'm gonna be very put off from dating for a long time until I move from my hometown. I feel like growing a pair of breasts is gonna gain me a heck of a notice in the male booby fandom. So I decided I won't date anyone from my hometown because of that. But I've read a lot of stuff about how it is hard. I know I can't stop anyone from feeling any kind of way that is uncertain about dating trans. But you know, I don't know if I should feel more empowered or not. Also I've been kind of sad that I feel like my mom won't like it that I'm gonna transition. I have told her just to give her a heads up but she wasn't too happy about it. I feel like if I ask her to give me an early birthday present and help me pay for this she'll just get really mad and put the, ""UH YOU JUST WANT ME TO PAY FOR IT ALL AND BLAH BLAH. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE OTHER THINGS TO PAY FOR AND YOU ARE OLD ENOUGH TO NOT GET PRESENTS ANY MORE AND YOU HAVE A JOB GO PAY FOR IT YOURSELF!"". I don't know.

I'm 20 years old, living in Denmark. I don't really care that much about what people think of me or the decisions i make. But one thing really bothers me. I have a hard time understanding what i want with life, and pretty much everything to do with gender/my body. I often have the feeling of wanting to be more femminin, girly, etc.
Wearing girl clothing feels nice and i'm a pretty slim person (not in a bad way) so i think it looks pretty good, generally i just feel better when i wear female or unisex clothing. But on the other hand, i really like to do stereotypical guy stuff, go to the gym to get stronger, the type of clothing, etc. 
I have thought about being a girl for many years, but i'm not sure if i should actually should do it; One of my main issues is that i think i only feel this way while i'm young, and when i'm older (40-50), i won't have those feelings anymore. I have a hard time imagining myself reaching mid-late adulthood as a women.

So yeah; My main problem is that i'm struggling with how things will be in the future, for now i just don't know. What if i'm just idolizing the female body in its 20's, and will regret my decision once i grow older? But if i don't decide soon, will i have started too late and be too old to pass as a women?
I might get kicked out by my family if i decide to do it (still live at home at the moment), but that's not that big of a problem because i own a tent. 

I'm open to any kind of advice, right now i'm pretty much out of ideas. I had a good friend i wanted to ask about this, but because of personal reasons we sadly don't talk anymore.

52,2016-08-16 11:29:44,4xz0hq,6,24,"This happened a few days ago but I've kinda been processing it.

There's a Cheddar's within walking distance of my apartment. There's also a Pokestop and a gym there. I will sometimes walk down there, order a few overpriced drinks, and get a little tipsy as I spin the pokestop and level the gym (Go team Valor! ^_^) Anyway, as usual, I forgot my ID and this time they decided I couldn't order without it.

So I walked back to my apartment, and as I was walking I noticed a police car behaving oddly. First, it pulled over and stopped right near me. I hesitated, but they didn't roll down their window turn on their lights, or otherwise try to get my attention, so I just kept walking. This area near my apartment was a Y intersection and I was walking up the foot of the Y, with my apartment on the left arm. The police car pulled up, went down that left arm to the end (past my apartment) and I thought I was in the clear, but they turned around and came back. They stopped at the stop sign and just..sat there. Way, way too long.

I was starting to get nervous by this point. I'm autistic and have PTSD from my time in the army, so someone clearly stalking me was triggering enough, but someone behaving in a way counter to expectations was driving me near breakdown. I was raised white, upper middle class, cis, and male, with ""neuroatypical"" being my only real point of marginalization. Of course this meant that I was taught the police are my friend, I should always trust the police, and if I have nothing to hide I have nothing to worry about. I've since learned enough about the world to question those assumptions, but I've never *experienced* it, you know?

I took a shortcut past the police car and into my apartment complex while trying to act natural. That's easy enough because I do take the shortcut sometimes, just not often in heels. I went into my apartment to get my ID and it took me a minute to find it. When I came back out, my fears were confirmed and the police car was sitting outside.

Now I'm going to give the officer credit here. From this point on he was very polite. Not perfect, mind you, but I could tell he was trying. He addressed me as...basically the original third option from Fallen London, ""Si...er...ma'...er...yes,"" which was amusing because he clearly was not referencing it intentionally. I corrected him to ""ma'am"" and he used from then on. He said that they were looking for a ""Troy"" who...again, he struggled before settling on, ""fit your description."" He asked my name, I told him. I first told him my new name, then realized that might confuse the information he'd already gotten off his computer so I gave him my old name (I don't consider it a dead name).

He asked me if I lived here, and then asked me for ID (thank God I'd just gotten it!) It doesn't have my current hair color, let alone my real gender (2 years, 4 months respectively). To break tension I joked that ""The license is a liiittle out of date. I dyed my hair since then."" He laughed, gave me back my license, thanked me, and we were both on our separate ways.

I've been thinking about this incident and decided to post about it not as a complaint about being hassled by the police, but just an observation that this has *never* happened in my entire privileged life to this point. I've never been stopped because I fit a description. Up until now, I've been nondescript. And I can't shake this feeling that the Troy they were looking for probably looks absolutely nothing like me except being a trans woman. Probably black, just for irony's sake here.

When you're used to privilege, it feels like oppression to be treated like everyone else. Is my sudden ability to ""fit a description,"" oppression, or just lack of previously held privilege? I don't know, but now I'm more wary of police cars. If it happens again, and I have a sinking feeling it will, next officer might not even try to be polite.

Before I met him I had considered myself a lesbian for the last 15 years. I'm currently unsure what to consider myself now I am completely in love with this guy. I'm not usually one to label but I do have a rainbow tattoo that means Pride on my arm very visible to anybody who shakes my hand. I met him and my whole life has changed. We have both been married and divorced myself once and him twice. I have met his family and they are amazing I have never been so welcomed  by family before my whole life. He has three brothers and his mother and father. He has adorable nieces and nephews. And we have huge plans for our future.

I have a question for anybody out there who is with someone who is trans or has advice... or just anyone with advice. I fell in love with him almost instantly. Even though he is nothing like anybody I have ever met before. I am very protective of him and his feelings which may seem a little odd. But one of the things that gets me the most is when people call him by the wrong gender or the wrong name. I know that for most it is still routine from the life he used to have. But when I heard today that his co-workers who have only known him as he is now... They have called him she. Even though he has been on T for 18 months he hasn't exactly grown as much facial hair as he wished he had. I know that he will feel much more masculine when that happens but until then how do I keep myself from wanting to kick the ass of someone who offends him.. knowing how he wished to be addressed and still going against it. (Not his family however when they still call him by his birth name or say she or sister I don't correct them but I don't change how I address him) 
I have never worn so many girly shoes girly pants and outfits and makeup and done my hair so much before I met him. But I have found that when I do he is called Sir more often and is gender dysphoria isn't so rough on him. He claims it's because they are paying more attention to me. And not so much to him.

For a great deal of my life, I've struggled with dysphoria between my assigned gender (male) and my gender identity (if not fully female, then at least somewhere on that part of the spectrum). However, through all my years, I've become more painfully aware of the fact that steps toward aligning more with my gender identity (facial hair removal/body hair reduction/etc) are relatively impossible with how my body is. In short, I generally loathe my body, and it makes me very uncomfortable to be seen in it because I don't like the fact that people automatically associate me with masculinity when they see me.

For this reason, as I've grown older, it's become more and more difficult to actually get OUT there and do things. Being constantly aware that my body is not what I want it to be has led to an enormous amount of awareness of several things, but particularly, my issue here is this: I take up space and am ashamed of doing so because I don't like the way that I occupy that space. For my whole life I have done my best to make myself small and gone out of my way to never manspread or anything like that because I am all the more spatially conscious and want to be perceived as small, but being 6'2"" makes it very difficult to not be noticed, and it makes it exceptionally difficult to be seen as anything but male when everything about you screams ""MAN!"" 

I have attempted to lessen this masculine presentation numerous times through different measures, but my body seems to have some kind of vendetta against any kind of process that would make this easier for me. Laser hair removal and other processes like that do not work on my hair type, and despite all my attempts at minimizing body hair by other means, I've been ""blessed""/(cursed) by remarkably fast growing hair that is noticeable even when I shave. (In addition, every time I shave I break out with ingrown hairs and acne flare-ups, but that's just because I have godawful genetics that lead to sensitive skin). In short, no matter what I've tried (clothing-wise or physically), I cannot minimalise my masculine presentation to a point where I am comfortable in my body.

For this reason, I have a great deal of trouble being in public spaces, because the more people there are around me, the more aware I am that I am taking up space that could be used for someone else, an the more aware I am that people actually notice me. I can't go with my boyfriend to clubs anymore because whenever I go, I immediately have to escape the crowded atmosphere because my self-consciousness paralyzes me. I would pursue less crowded situations, but in those cases, I tend to simply feel lonely. This has led to a worsening of previous depressive habits of hiding away and trying to not be seen or to go places where I will be seen, which is really hard for someone like myself who is enormously extroverted in nature.

What I want to know is whether other people have gotten over issues like this before, and perhaps how I can work toward being more comfortable being in public.

Non binary fits, but doesn't feel right. To me, the definition is sort of having gender, but fitting somewhere within the spectrum instead of right on one of the poles. 

Genderfluid is closer, but feels even less like me than nonbinary. How masculine/feminine I feel will generally change a bit, but it only changes by a few degrees on the gender spectrum.

Today i spent my evening by being fabulous and painting my nails light blue with golden glitter! but as soon as i think about going to work tomorrow and removing the color i feel sad ... it's not that i have a very restrictive job. i can easily wear a tshirt when meeting clients. i wear a rainbow colored necklace a lot. still ... i'm scared to show up with colored nails.

what makes me even more sad is, that i used to paint my nails and even wear skirts and stockings to parties when i was younger. i kissed everyone (boys, girls, don't care) and i loved it. but at some point i just ""grew"" into a ""normal"" member of society (32 now)... and i feel i can't go back. like my mother said when i showed up with my rainbow necklace: ""oh that phase again ...""

it's like all of those feelings i buried came back when i tried to understand how my non binary bi partner feels. and now it's totally too much but i don't want it to go away ... i hope that makes sense.

But through some experimentation I realised I was nonbinary, with more experimentation I figured I'm likely transfeminine as well so I started experimenting with HRT. Over the last year and a bit I've gone off and on HRT a number of times trying to find a place where I'm comfortable. Whenever I go off HRT I get uncomfortable with the resurgence of hair and apparently my moods are incredibly unstable and in general I'm not pleasant and I always end up wanting to go back on HRT. When I go off HRT I normally stay on a low dose of anti-androgens, so I'm not completely off, just not on E. Not sure if I could handle natural levels of T.

Then when I do go back on HRT because I'm not happy, I'm fine for a couple of months. The subtle feminization is a god send. The better skin the reduction in body hair, general softness of my bodily features. All fantastic. And then my breasts start coming in a bit and i freak the fuck out.

I also occasionally find myself missing how easy it was to get horny. But that's not too big a deal. Libido is supposed to come back later right?

I could just be having a masculine episode. But it just feels every time I make progress in one direction I desperately feel the need to pull back to a middle ground? I don't know anymore. I just feel stuck and trying to work out what I need is doing my head in. I'm on a relatively low dose of E too. 

I definitely dont feel capable of stopping HRT all together. But I feel like the longer I stay on HRT the more distressed I'll be. Or maybe it'll pass? I'm just incredibly confused. I'm afraid to move forward and terrified of moving backward (back to natural T). 

This post likely doesn't do my feelings any justice, but i just needed to offload how i feel. Does anyone else feel this way? Has anyone felt this way? What did you end up doing?

24,2016-08-07 05:17:04,4wjl16,4,7,"I'm 22 and entering my last semester of college soon.  As my time in college comes to a close, the search for a job begins, and my parents have been hounding me to cut off my hair to improve my odds of being hired, where ever that may be.

I don't exactly consider myself genderqueer, but I'm posting here as I feel it's somewhat relevant as I like having an feminine side to myself. (Ideally I'd wear some clothing that suggest some degree of femininity and shave my body, but I'm rather uncomfortable doing so in public.)

Nearly everyone I talk to about the search for employment and the unfortunate reality that my hair will limit my choices agrees that I need to suck it up and cut it off.  Apparently, if I want long hair I have to establish myself first.  It reaches about 4 inches past my shoulders, isn't dyed, and I just recently had it trimmed to clean up any dead ends and make it look neater.  If I was a girl there'd be no questions asked regarding my hair as it isn't by any means abnormal.  But because I'm a guy, it's not seen as professional.

This situation is no doubt a common one (though the reasons for wanting long hair may differ from person to person), though I feel like my disposition to hair related issues makes things more complicated....
***
I'll try and keep the backstory story short, but I've always been opposed to haircuts.  My parents were always in charge of when I'd get my hair cut and how I'd get it cut, only loosening their grip late into high school to allow it to be slightly longer than the standard nerdy ""my mom picked this cut.""  When I finally expressed interest in growing it, I got the ever repeated talk about how it will make others judge me and how self expression is unimportant as it impacts other's judgments.  Eventually even the slightly longer hair style I wore in high school was revoked from me after my parents secretly scheduled me a haircut, gave me a 3 minutes heads up, and my mother screamed at me until I would submit and have her drive me there and tell them to cut it short.  I couldn't look in the mirror for a week without my feeling nauseous.  Any time someone brought up my hair I felt my stomach do a flip and skin felt like pins and needles.  After two years of college, and more forced haircuts, I finally broke down crying to my mom over the phone telling her I couldn't take another haircut.  This also led to me telling her that I'm interested in guys (I said I was bisexual, though over time I feel like I lean more towards being gay) as the conversation progressed as I was afraid she'd draw conclusions, and I thought I might as well get it out of the way.  Her reaction, while shocked was neither positive or negative, and she hopes it's just a phase though was never nasty to me about it.

The other element to this story is that a good deal of my sexual attraction...is based around hair.  I love guys with long hair, and want to be able to pull off the look myself.  Even when a guy doesn't have long hair I find myself staring whenever someone has a particularly pretty hairstyle.  Even though I prefer guys, girls can have memorizing hairstyles as well.  A particularly pretty hair braid, a colorful pixie cut, I love it all so much.  Having somewhat of a hair fetish makes my predicament even more painful to me, as I often wish I could put my hair in a fancy bun or a fishtail braid.

Last, and fair warning this is really weird.  But for as long as I can remember, I have had a haircutting fetish.  I'm sexually aroused by watching mostly women have their hair cut very short or completely shaved off.  There's no sexual content in these videos/images, just hair cutting.  Perhaps this was a development due to my complete lack of freedom regarding my own hair and ability to be feminine.  I can't really explain why I have such a fetish, but I just do.  It was essentially all I would view for sexual pleasure in my high school years, though over time I distanced myself from it as it was upsetting to me to be aroused by something like that.  Having my haircut short mimics the feelings of humiliation and punishment present in some of those videos and makes me feel like I'm being disgraced.  Hence the not being able to look in a mirror after my cuts.  It makes me feel sub-human.

As my time in college comes to a close, the search for a job begins, and my parents have been hounding me to cut off my hair to improve my odds of being hired, where ever that may be.\n\nI don\'t exactly consider myself genderqueer, but I\'m posting here as I feel it\'s somewhat relevant as I like having an feminine side to myself. (Ideally I\'d wear some clothing that suggest some degree of femininity and shave my body, but I\'m rather uncomfortable doing so in public.)\n\nNearly everyone I talk to about the search for employment and the unfortunate reality that my hair will limit my choices agrees that I need to suck it up and cut it off.  Apparently, if I want long hair I have to establish myself first.  It reaches about 4 inches past my shoulders, isn\'t dyed, and I just recently had it trimmed to clean up any dead ends and make it look neater.  If I was a girl there\'d be no questions asked regarding my hair as it isn\'t by any means abnormal.  But because I\'m a guy, it\'s not seen as professional.\n\nThis situation is no doubt a common one (though the reasons for wanting long hair may differ from person to person), though I feel like my disposition to hair related issues makes things more complicated....\n***\nI\'ll try and keep the backstory story short, but I\'ve always been opposed to haircuts.  My parents were always in charge of when I\'d get my hair cut and how I\'d get it cut, only loosening their grip late into high school to allow it to be slightly longer than the standard nerdy ""my mom picked this cut.""  When I finally expressed interest in growing it, I got the ever repeated talk about how it will make others judge me and how self expression is unimportant as it impacts other\'s judgments.  Eventually even the slightly longer hair style I wore in high school was revoked from me after my parents secretly scheduled me a haircut, gave me a 3 minutes heads up, and my mother screamed at me until I would submit and have her drive me there and tell them to cut it short.  I couldn\'t look in the mirror for a week without my feeling nauseous.  Any time someone brought up my hair I felt my stomach do a flip and skin felt like pins and needles.  After two years of college, and more forced haircuts, I finally broke down crying to my mom over the phone telling her I couldn\'t take another haircut.  This also led to me telling her that I\'m interested in guys (I said I was bisexual, though over time I feel like I lean more towards being gay) as the conversation progressed as I was afraid she\'d draw conclusions, and I thought I might as well get it out of the way.  Her reaction, while shocked was neither positive or negative, and she hopes it\'s just a phase though was never nasty to me about it.\n\nThe other element to this story is that a good deal of my sexual attraction...is based around hair.  I love guys with long hair, and want to be able to pull off the look myself.  Even when a guy doesn\'t have long hair I find myself staring whenever someone has a particularly pretty hairstyle.  Even though I prefer guys, girls can have memorizing hairstyles as well.  A particularly pretty hair braid, a colorful pixie cut, I love it all so much.  Having somewhat of a hair fetish makes my predicament even more painful to me, as I often wish I could put my hair in a fancy bun or a fishtail braid.\n\nLast, and fair warning this is really weird.  But for as long as I can remember, I have had a haircutting fetish.  I\'m sexually aroused by watching mostly women have their hair cut very short or completely shaved off.  There\'s no sexual content in these videos/images, just hair cutting.  Perhaps this was a development due to my complete lack of freedom regarding my own hair and ability to be feminine.  I can\'t really explain why I have such a fetish, but I just do.  It was essentially all I would view for sexual pleasure in my high school years, though over time I distanced myself from it as it was upsetting to me to be aroused by something like that.  Having my haircut short mimics the feelings of humiliation and punishment present in some of those videos and makes me feel like I\'m being disgraced.  Hence the not being able to look in a mirror after my cuts.  It makes me feel sub-human.\n\n***\n\nThat turned out considerably longer than I expected.

Any and all insight is appreciated. If I go this path my endo and I will be monitoring bone density and other things to make sure everything goes alright. That was actually the plan for the last six months but I jumped the gun and got on estrogen shortly after.

 I'm also a little worried about the potential medical depression from taking only cyproterone acetate by itself, which I know can happen and which I feel I have experienced during the stints where I was on it briefly by itself.

Basically, as mentioned previously, I feel very dysphoric for not having a vagina and occasionally breasts as well. There's a bit of fluidity with the whole thing but that handles most of it.

44,2016-08-10 20:41:20,4x4aju,14,23,"I'm AMAB, nonbinary, and mostly attracted to women and people exhibiting feminine qualities.  I haven't made any hormonal or surgical alterations to my body, and I probably won't, so my anatomy is male, although I don't have a very masculine build: I'm slender and have little muscle, and oddly, women's clothing often fits me better than men's. I suspect my hormone level may naturally be less masculine than typical for cis men, but I've never had this tested.

I have a great deal of shame associated with my sexuality, and I've recently decided I want to overcome this, but I'm not sure how.  I'm not sure why, but when I have tried to find resources online that are sex-positive and affirming of sexuality, they often don't resonate with me and don't speak to my experience.  I also have never heard any people, neither nonbinary people, women, nor men, explicitly voice dealing with the type of shame (or experience of sexuality) that I experience.  The closest I get is relating to accounts of women who feel intense shame associated with their sexuality, but these women don't deal with being perceived as male (and thus having their sexuality perceived as a threat) so they're missing what I see as one of the biggest pieces of my experience.

I think I have a combination of traits that makes me particularly vulnerable to internalized shame associated with sexuality.  These factors include:

* I am sensitive.  I feel emotions strongly, empathizing easily and intensely with others.  This can make me feel guilt and shame more strongly. Sometimes I can feel intensely bad in response to seeing that another person is upset in response to something that I did.
* Growing up, I picked up a lot of ""feminine"" aspects of socialization, such as wanting to please people, putting other people's needs ahead of my own, and avoiding ""hurting other people's feelings"".  I sometimes struggle with these things to the point of denying my basic needs.
* I am perceived as male by most people, and associated with this, my expressions of sexuality and romantic interest, and sometimes even my mere presence, can be perceived as a threat. From talking to men, I get the sense that this is harder for me to deal with than most men, because I'm so much more sensitive.
* I am most attracted to women significantly younger than me.  I'm 36 but am most attracted to women in the 20-28 age range and rarely attracted to women my own age.  This worsens my fear of being perceived as a predator or as ""creepy"", and contributes to internalized shame. I also find this tricky because it's one way in which my sexuality behaves more like a stereotypical straight male, and I worry that this pattern may feed into me being perceived as male or my sexuality being perceived as like straight male sexuality, in ways that lead to gross misunderstandings of me.
* I can sometimes be socially awkward.  Although I have always tested as not being on the autism spectrum I sometimes exhibit some asperger's-like patterns of social interaction, especially when feeling anxious, under stress, or feeling excluded or disconnected from people. In these mindsets, I struggle with disregarding social signals or awkwardly timing my comments. This worsens my fears about being perceived as ""creepy"", thus contributing to shame.
* I have never seen another example of someone expressing my sexuality the way it feels most natural for me to.  The closest examples I see are young lesbians who are ""girl crazy"" on Tumblr, or men who are labeled as ""lady's men"" or more derogatorily, as ""womanizers"".  Lesbian sexuality can sometimes be shamed in our society, and I wonder if the fact that I identify somewhat with lesbians has contributed to my shame. But also, I think seeing ways in which men who express warm and affectionate feelings, yet also romantic or sexual desires, towards multiple women, are labeled negatively (and their affection is often interpreted as insincere or manipulative, their intentions interpreted as being to try to ""get sex"" by deceiving women), has also contributed to my shame, because I identify somewhat with these men as well.
* The things I find physically attractive or unattractive can be different from cultural depictions of what is considered ""sexy"".  For example, I find things like high heels, bold makeup and red lipstick, lingerie, some tight clothing, or stereotypically ""sexy"" body language, all the imagery you hear discussed when people talk about the ""male gaze"" in movies and media, I find much of this to be an intense turnoff.  This may be because I associate these things with objectification of women, but I'm not exactly sure why, I just don't find it attractive.  I find myself intensely attracted to comfortable, casual looks, and what I see as relaxed, friendly, often androgynous body language.  When I've shown people what I find most attractive, even most sexually arousing, people have been pretty open about it seeming strongly disjoint from what most straight men find arousing.  People have described what I find sexually arousing, as ""wholesome"", a word that is sometimes associated with meaning non-sexual.
* For me, I cannot separate my sexuality from intense feelings of caring and a desire for emotional closeness and intimacy with a person.  To me, a physical attraction is a powerful source of these deeper desires.  I associate these feelings with sexuality, not just romance, so for me, feeling an ""instant"" connection or ""physical attraction"" with someone, even if I'm looking at something ""superficial"" like appreciating how their shorts fit and checking out their legs, manifests not as a desire for sex, but as a desire to get to know the person, to touch them affectionately, to say sweet and affirming things to them, and to be around them and be close to them, a feeling of gratitude towards them and a desire to help them or serve them.  This is one of the key things that I don't hear expressed often or even at all, and it's at the very heart of my experience of sexuality.  Instead I hear people, both women and men, talking about how they want to ""fuck"" someone, and talk about having sex just for the sensations or for the sake of it, without any emotional bond, or sexuality that centers around ""getting"" something. I not only do not think I'm capable of this and don't desire it, the very idea of it I find utterly repulsive and it gives me a skin-crawling sensation and makes me feel nauseous to even think of it.  The role I want sexuality to play in my life is as something that helps me to build strong bonds of friendship with people.  Yet the most visible alternative that I see to this ""free sex for the sake of sex"" is a puritanical view of sex that focuses on monogamy and traditional gender norms.  So I feel shame originating from the ""right wing culture"" which I've sometimes gravitated towards, in an attempt to get away from the ""cheap"" approach towards sex that I see in mainstream society, but I also feel shame associated with the disgust I feel towards casual sex and hookup culture, like I have this fear that I'm judging people for making choices different from mine and this somehow makes me a bad person.
* Although I often desire monogamous sexual relationships, I have a polyamorous orientation and I strongly desire an ability to express loving feelings towards multiple people that I feel attracted to. For me, feeling attracted to one person makes me feel more warm and caring towards people across the board, and these feelings spill over to other women, nonbinary people, and even to men.  I think polyamory is strongly taboo, usually entirely erased, in our culture, which I think is highly mononormative, and I think that my polyamorous desires are also a source of intense shame, as well as a source of specific problems in monogamous relationships.  I find it hard to find people who are open to polyamorous relationships of any sort, let alone the sort I want (which might be sexually monogamous but open to affectionate, loving feelings, and intimate friendships with multiple people), and I feel like my dating pool is already tiny enough, so I've spent a lot of time in monogamous relationships, and I've had repeated problems with my partners' jealousy and an inability to share my intimate thoughts about other people with my partner (this is *essential* to me in a relationship, I want a partner where sharing these feelings bring us together).
* The interaction between sexuality and friendship for me is blurry and ambiguous and I find this creates more trouble for me.  For me, attraction makes me desire friendship more strongly, and when I feel close to people emotionally it makes me feel more attracted to them (even with men, although I'm more attracted to women, the men I feel closest to, I also feel most attracted to). But I find women often want me to clearly identify whether I have romantic or sexual feelings for them, or friendly feelings, and to me, these things all go together in one big blurry continuum.  Whereas I want to navigate sexuality through expressing desires, asking questions, asserting boundaries, listening, and respecting other people's boundaries, I feel like most other people push me to categorize my desires into categories like ""dating"" and ""friendship"" and ""friends with benefits"" and stuff like this.  This doesn't work for me.  I find the act of labeling and categorizing my sexuality to be severely restricting, stifling, oppressive...and it seems to be used as a stand-in for direct communication and expression of boundaries.  I don't even know how to respect people's boundaries if they tell me something like ""I just think of you as a friend."" because to me, many of my expressions of sexual desire are things that are interpreted as being part of friendship, and someone telling me this does nothing to clarify exactly where their boundary lies.  This is another source of shame for me, both because it's a disconnect between me and others, and because it leads to situations in which I am misunderstood, and sometimes even directly criticized or shamed when I act in ways that other people feel uncomfortable with.

I think my shame originates from a combination of these factors.

Yeah!  I'm sorry this is a lot, it's so long I know, but it really helped to get this out, these are things I haven't ever expressed in one place before.

Whereas I want to navigate sexuality through expressing desires, asking questions, asserting boundaries, listening, and respecting other people\'s boundaries, I feel like most other people push me to categorize my desires into categories like ""dating"" and ""friendship"" and ""friends with benefits"" and stuff like this.  This doesn\'t work for me.  I find the act of labeling and categorizing my sexuality to be severely restricting, stifling, oppressive...and it seems to be used as a stand-in for direct communication and expression of boundaries.  I don\'t even know how to respect people\'s boundaries if they tell me something like ""I just think of you as a friend."" because to me, many of my expressions of sexual desire are things that are interpreted as being part of friendship, and someone telling me this does nothing to clarify exactly where their boundary lies.  This is another source of shame for me, both because it\'s a disconnect between me and others, and because it leads to situations in which I am misunderstood, and sometimes even directly criticized or shamed when I act in ways that other people feel uncomfortable with.\n\nI think my shame originates from a combination of these factors.\n\nYeah!  I\'m sorry this is a lot, it\'s so long I know, but it really helped to get this out, these are things I haven\'t ever expressed in one place before.\n\nAnd I\'d be really grateful if anyone has any insight, even if it\'s just into a small piece of this.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'How can I affirm my sexuality and overcome internalized shame?', 'created': 1470886880.0}"

I've voiced concerns because he identifies as straight and this makes him kinda not quite straight but he says he doesn't care about that kind of thing.

I love girls with long hair and hips wider than shoulders. Because of my affinity with long hair I decided to stop cutting mine (currently only 10cm long) and let it grow. Then it hit me: I want to look and behave like girls.  

So I am familiar with the word androgyny because of Pete Burns circa 1985 and I figured I can do that too. That's why I have come here. I hope to get some tips on how to do my best to make my hair grow the fastest and become cute and lovely. I also want to start exercising to get my body as close to my preferences as possible (but the question is if that is even possible because I'm sure men are fundamentally different from women). I should say I'm perfectly fine with my genitalia and want to keep being a guy but look like a girl and perhaps do girly things but just don't know where to even start from. 

Do the guys and gals of this subreddit have any advice for me? Like lifestyle, interests, diet, shopping tips that I can learn from? I want to have like chest long hair and thick hips and thighs and shins and calves, and also be able to wear a skirt in public and make friends who can accept me.

77,2016-08-19 13:14:34,4yiugp,9,5,"So, I'm AFAB and would tentatively identify as bigender. I don't have any plans for HRT or GRS of any kind, but I do on some days identify as more masculine. My friends and SO know but my family doesn't. 

My dad is getting married at the beginning of next month to a very nice lady. She's been trying her best to get to know me ever since she and my dad started dating (I'm 22, they started dating about two years ago). And I've been mostly accepting of this.

However, there have been moments recently where her attempts to ""bond"" with me have sort of caused me to have dysphoric moments. Recently, she helped her daughter (who's about my age) pick out a dress. She talked about how she's really good at seeing what outfits work best on people, and she said that any girls coming to the wedding could ask for her help shopping. Then she turned to me and said ""you're next, kitkatkez"".

Everyone laughed. I laughed along. Inside I died. It's a funny thing, I've always had these feelings anytime someone drew attention to the fact that in their eyes I was 100% a girl, but now that I'm more out with my identity I feel it even more. I guess I always thought before that I was just an awkward tomboy afraid that I had to leave that stuff behind. Now I know it's something more.

That wasn't the end of it. My dad really wants me to talk to his fiancé more, so he kept talking to me and texting me about how I need a dress for the wedding and she's more than willing to help. I told him I don't like shopping with other people (true) and I also already have a dress (sorta true). I ended up buying a simple dress just to end the discussion. 

About a week ago I went to visit her and my dad. She kept asking me about my bangs, told me she could show me how to get them in one direction/easily trim them. At first I declined but she kept asking so I finally relented. As we were going upstairs I asked if my SO wanted to come with me and she said ""no, you go ahead and relax, this is girl time"". Needles in the brain. It wasn't a bad experience (I don't like people touching my hair but the advice she gave me was helpful) but that comment just kept going through my head. 

My dad during the dress episode sent me a thing about how ""all the girls are going to wear dresses and all the guys are going to wear dress shirts and slacks"" and there's still a burning part of me that wants to wear the second thing. But I worry that since they were so insistent on the dress thing that me doing that will be taken as me being difficult, and take away from their wedding, which is the absolute last thing I want to do.

It's just - stuff like this makes me think that I'm never going to get to be acknowledged the way I want to unless I transition completely. And I don't blame either of them, they don't know anything about this. But I don't know if I should tell them. My dad wouldn't cut off contact or anything, they wouldn't hate me but they wouldn't understand. My dad only now is starting to understand binary trans issues and he still misgenders people and says stuff like ""well if a woman wants to take hormones so she can be a man, why should anyone stop her, let her live her life."" Which I guess is better than hating trans people? Not by much? I love my dad but maaan. I just can't imagine explaining non binary to him at this point. Much less to his fiancé. 

I just feel a little sad because back when I was young and seen as a tomboy my dad always seemed to have my back on not liking feminine things. He stopped my bio mom from piercing my ears when I was a baby because he thought I should get to make that decision myself, and I decided I didn't want it. He gave me my early love of video games, a hobby that at the time was seen as even more of a boys club than now. My mom always hemmed and hawed about how he was just turning me into a boy because he never had a son, but he was letting me be me. Now I wish he'd say something to his fiancé about how maybe giving me girl time isn't the way for us to get to know each other. Instead I feel like he's putting it on me to bloom into my feminine flower already so we can be besties. But I know that's not what he means, it's more just me dealing with dysphoria blowing this all out of proportion. 

I guess, can anyone offer any words of advice in this situation?

80,2016-08-19 17:34:06,4yk75x,17,17,"Hey guys. Let me preface this by saying I'm still a bit confused about my gender identity, as I constantly change my mind about what I'm feeling. I may be genderfluid but frankly I don't know if I'm fluid enough for that? Like what will typically happen is I will talk myself in a circle, leaving me even less sure about what I feel I am.

This being said I've found that I'm happiest when I feel like a girl, besides the dysphoria that sets in when I realize that well, I'm not one. I've thought for a while that I wish I was born a girl, but this also isn't consistent and I sometimes appreciate being a dude. I enjoy browsing Reddit, including some of the LGBT+ friendly subreddits, however when I had came upon people posting about being MTF I felt somewhat of a disconnect, i.e. I'm happy for them etc but that's not me. However recently I was browsing and it's like a switch flipped, I found myself fantasizing about being a girl and all that jazz. However I want to reiterate that it's a matter of wanting to be a girl, not necessarily feeling like one. This may be because I find many girls attractive (I'm pan but def more into girls then guys) or may be because I have a bit of a link for this type of thing (i.e. dressing up in girl clothes usually arouses me, although I also get somewhat of an emotional gratification from it). On the flip side whenever I've seen stuff about people transitioning from a female to male, I've picked up that I feel something along the lines of ""why would they want to do that? Who would want to be a guy, especially when you get to be born a girl?"" (With all due respect to those people that are FTM, do whatever makes you happy :))

To further complicate things I don't always feel this way, and there are varying shades to the feelings, i.e. when I feel like I want to be a girl that can be a guy sometimes.

Hello there, I'm AFAB and an androgyne. And oh joy; I'm going into high school! I'm looking forward to the academic advances and the freedom... but everything else, not so much. As if starting freshman year isn't hard enough, I have some gender-related concerns. I just want to make my high school years as enjoyable as I can. Any input from more experienced people is greatly appreciated.  

To begin, I’ll give context:  
* I’ve gradually transitioned to androgyny since the summer of last year, and I’ve never felt better.  
* Assuming my high school is the same as my middle school, changing rooms won’t have stalls and you will be expected to change in front of everyone else in the room.  
* I wear a binder to cope with my mild body dysphoria and to look more androgynous.  
* I have come out to my parents, and they are more or less accepting. They don’t understand, and feel weary or uncomfortable about it, but at least they try and don’t hate me for it. The way they talk to me tells me they’ll never be able to see me as anything other than a girl (for example, no matter how I explain it to my dad, he’ll say “...but you know you _are_ a girl, right?” and it’s extremely discouraging to say the least. My dad isn’t even as bad as my mom. The only other people in my family who know are a couple cousins.  
* If it is of any importance, I have a therapist who is in contact with school counselors and teachers.  
First of all, what should I do about changing for gym? My parents say going to a separate room, such as a bathroom, would make me an outcast and segregate me from others. They think people would wonder about why and such. On the contrary, I wear a binder. I guess I could wear a tank top over it when I change. As long as I convince myself a ""girl's"" locker room is just another way of saying anyone-whose-biological-sex-is-female's locker room, I feel alright with using it.  
Any suggestions on the whole parent situation? It could be worse but they keep hurting me and I can’t explain stuff to them in a way that they understand.  
If anything should pop up, how do you think I should handle social conflicts regarding my gender?  
 Should I use a different name? The name I was given at birth is very feminine, and was the 2nd most popular girl name of my year. It's not too bad of a name, but last year I picked out a neutral name for myself that I adore, and my friends call me by it. I'm debating whether I should go through the trouble of getting all the teachers to call me by my new name, or just stick with my old one and keep the new one for friends.  
The ultimate decision here is deciding to fully transition, which would make life harder but me happier; or to pass as an andro woman, which would make life easier but me uncomfortable if not unhappy.  

Any other advice for surviving high school in general would be greatly appreciated. Anything helps. Thanks!

TL;DR; Androgyne. I should completely transition, or save that until after high school to make things easier?

93,2016-08-21 03:16:54,4ysuvh,2,2,"Hi, I'm new to reddit. I'm also... kinda new...? to genderqueer stuff.

(Sorry in advance if I kind of jump around or don't make much sense... I'm trying to explain everything and not leave anything out. But, I'm not really sure how. My thoughts on the subject are just really scattered.)

Anyway, I'd like some advice from people who I'm sure have gone through very similar situations as me.

I'm AFAB, Pan/Ace, married to a cis male who is straight. I've questioned my gender before... a lot... off and on. I was never comfortable being called a woman, or lady, or anything like that. ""Girl"" is okay sometimes...? ""She"" is okay most of the time. Being called a wife is... also okay I guess.

Anyway, I've questioned it for a while, off and on. Sometimes I'll give up and just decide it's easier to ""stay"" a female. And just when I think I'm getting comfortable with it... I realize it feels all wrong and it makes me feel... not myself. And then I'll start questioning again. I've discussed this with my husband and, while he's really confused by the whole thing, he's pretty supportive. Even though he's straight.

Anyway I'm going through a period of questioning it again, and this time I really want to figure it out... I'm tired of this cycle. But I'm also so afraid of losing my husband. I love him so much, and I've never met anyone that I've felt so comfortable with and had such an easy time communicating with and I just love his company and the relationship that we have.... and he says he's okay with all of this. But... can a straight person really be with a genderqueer person?

Anyway... I still like feminine things. I still want to wear feminine things. But I don't feel like I am a woman, and I don't want to really be viewed as a woman, generally. I want to be viewed as somewhere in between.. or maybe as not having a gender at all?

And, I have size 32DD breasts. Which make me so uncomfortable in my own body. I mean, I'm pretty sure that I do want to have breasts. I just want them to be a lot smaller... less obvious. I don't want boob and cleavage hanging all over the place. I want them to be smaller, and more easily hidden. Like... an A or B cup?

And I just went through a long period of trying, again, to just be a woman. I thought maybe now that I'm married, I could get used to it. I bought some new/nicer clothes, and tried to just... live as a woman. And it was okay, at first. But then I started really getting uncomfortable with it again... I felt like I wasn't being true to myself. I mean, I did like some of the clothes. But, I don't like trying to see myself as a woman. I just... can't. It feels damaging to my mental health to do that, like I'm spending all of my time pretending.

But, I know I'm not a male either.

I guess... I need to do a lot more research on what genders there are, and try to find one that fits. Does anyone have any advice?

Also, like I asked above.... can straight people really be with someone who is not part of the gender binary... if they're supportive and still love the person? I mean, wouldn't that make them not straight... and then you'd be asking them to be something they're not? I don't want to live a lie... it makes me so uncomfortable.

It's been a year since I realized I was genderqueer and started transitioning. I settled on the label genderfluid because I had fluctuations. I spent a lot of my time femme, neither, and both, but I did spend some time as masc. There was a definite feeling inside, that told me what gender I was that day. (I usually defined it in terms of percentages, like 80F10M being femme, and 70F60M is both.)

But somehow, that feeling has ebbed away from me. As far as I can tell, I'm approximately 60F20M. More femme than masc, but uncomfortable with being gendered either way.

My dad tried to make me wear skirts all the time and forbid key from having short hair because he thought I wasn't girly enough.

As a teenager and young adult, I would sometimes refer to myself as ""butch"" and ""dikey"" (apologies if that is offensive to anyone here) even though I liked boys. I always said I wasn't feminine, that I felt like a guy, even though people told me I was ""very feminine."" (I'm short, squeaky, have apparently feminine features and am curvy although I am working to become leaner and more muscular.) My sister and best friend, however, separately told me I was ""really a gay man."" Always been extremely attracted to gay men.

I always felt different from other girls/women. When I was at a middle-school slumber party or bridal shower, I would think ""These girls are awesome, they're my friends, I like them, but I don't belong here."" 

If I imagined an alternate identity for a role-playing game or something, it was always either male or if it was female, I would hate the character.

Now I am almost 30, married to a wonderful man (who calls himself ""faggy"" -- again sorry for offensive language -- and is basically queer). Also have given birth to and breastfed a baby, who is now an awesome toddler. 

I have been trying so hard to be more feminine because I felt like my ""not like other girls"" feeling was just internalized misogyny. Like, we are so conditioned to think masculine == better. I took that gender test that was floating around and got ""casually masculine,"" but so did pretty much every other woman I know because all the feminine traits were like wimpy, manipulative, petty, etc. and all the masculine traits were assertive, competent, logical... So we live in a society that teaches ""women are stupid and have poor character."" Who wouldn't want to be masculine?

But I am always feeling this disconnect like I don't fit into my own body/identity/life and I'm not sure other women feel that. After my umpteenth breakdown over this, my husband said ""Honestly, it sounds like you're trans. Or at least you're definitely genderqueer."" (He is fine with this, since he likes guys too.)

I have tried so hard to expunge my internalized misogyny and feel good about being feminine and it hasn't worked. Where is the difference?

PS I recently got implants trying to feel more feminine and I was upset last night about not being able to bind anymore, but in some ways I like my fake tits because they are so very fake, and it makes me feel ironically less feminine.

Both my boyfriend and myself have had a good amount of exposure to the transgender community through drag; and understand the struggles they face. However, ""genderqueer"" is an entirely new term to us - and we're both trying to wrap our heads around it.

To me it seems (and pardon me if this is offensive; please let me know as I'm uneducated in genderqueer issues) that if you were born female but identify as male (or vice versa) you would be 'transgender' or 'transsexual' (by varying definitions).

Are there people that fall into the 'born one gender but strictly want to be the other' category that identify as genderqueer?

I'm female, cis, and mostly cool with this but with a seemingly increasing masculine streak. My girlfriend's trans and pre-op, trying to make the best of things while waiting for SRS. Sex has been getting pretty darn nice as we figure each other out, so that rocks. Now, we've greatly looked forward to my eventually penetrating her (she definitely wanted me to, and it grew on me as time went on), but due to unfortunate anal circumstances, we've just determined that this is probably off the table for quite a while.

I'm bummed (pardon me), and I'm not alone in that. As much as we enjoy what we can already do, and this is far from the end of the world or the relationship, I think it's going to suck to have to put these urges on hold for however many months remain, to have these anatomical limitations extend to the roles we take on. So I'm wondering, how can I give this seemingly masculine energy expression, and how can I help her still feel as feminine as she wants, given our current equipment and that new constraint?

I'm not looking to make penetration possible--I trust the owner of the ass when she says it's not feasible, and I'll stay just as hard in the nightstand drawer between now and go-time, however distant. I'm also fairly sure that, at least in my case, this question isn't *entirely* a matter of control--I'll take charge, sure, but doing so doesn't quite do the trick, doesn't satisfy the desire.

Now, we've greatly looked forward to my eventually penetrating her (she definitely wanted me to, and it grew on me as time went on), but due to unfortunate anal circumstances, we've just determined that this is probably off the table for quite a while.\n\nI'm bummed (pardon me), and I'm not alone in that. As much as we enjoy what we can already do, and this is far from the end of the world or the relationship, I think it's going to suck to have to put these urges on hold for however many months remain, to have these anatomical limitations extend to the roles we take on. So I'm wondering, how can I give this seemingly masculine energy expression, and how can I help her still feel as feminine as she wants, given our current equipment and that new constraint?\n\nI'm not looking to make penetration possible--I trust the owner of the ass when she says it's not feasible, and I'll stay just as hard in the nightstand drawer between now and go-time, however distant. I'm also fairly sure that, at least in my case, this question isn't *entirely* a matter of control--I'll take charge, sure, but doing so doesn't quite do the trick, doesn't satisfy the desire. More like, what acts performed on or with these body parts will align psychologically with how we want to relate to each other?

(apologies that this ended up as kind of a rant o//o)

I've seen genderfluid people and other trans folks who aren't genderfluid use different variations of the term (genderfluid, gender fluid, gender-fluid), and it doesn't bother me since those people tend to have an understanding of genderfluidity and/or gender/trans stuff. 

I used to be pretty indifferent to this, but over the years I've seen articles cropping up that talk about ""gender fluidity"" as a fashion trend. For example, there've been a lot of articles assuming that Jaden Smith is ""gender fluid"" because of his style that breaks traditional gender norms. I love his sense of style and he may very well be genderfluid, but he hasn't said anything about it (as far as I've seen, correct me if I'm wrong), so the articles feel kind of like they're disrespecting his voice in the matter. It comes off as the writers not understanding that genderfluid people are real and that it's a legitimate gender identity versus just a series of fashion choices.

So now because of all that, I get kind of annoyed when I see people without an understanding of genderfluidity refer to it as ""gender fluid"", or ""gender fluid style"". I've come out to people, cis and trans, who initially only ""support"" me because they think I'm a cis girl who wants to mix up my fashion sense versus ""genderfluid"" being a descriptor for my gender identity. (Cue ""not trans enough?"" feelings :( )

I don't exactly consider myself genderfluid, but I'm posting here as I feel it's somewhat relevant as I like having an feminine side to myself. (Ideally I'd wear some clothing that suggest some degree of femininity and shave my body, but I'm rather uncomfortable doing so in public.)

Nearly everyone I talk to about the search for employment and the unfortunate reality that my hair will limit my choices agrees that I need to suck it up and cut it off.  Apparently, if I want long hair I have to establish myself first.  It reaches about 4 inches past my shoulders, isn't dyed, and I just recently had it trimmed to clean up any dead ends and make it look neater.  If I was a girl there'd be no questions asked regarding my hair as it isn't by any means abnormal.  But because I'm a guy, it's not seen as professional.

This situation is no doubt a common one (though the reasons for wanting long hair may differ from person to person), though I feel like my disposition to hair related issues makes things more complicated....
***
I'll try and keep the backstory story short, but I've always been opposed to haircuts.  My parents were always in charge of when I'd get my hair cut and how I'd get it cut, only loosening their grip late into high school to allow it to be slightly longer than the standard nerdy ""my mom picked this cut.""  When I finally expressed interest in growing it, I got the ever repeated talk about how it will make others judge me and how self expression is unimportant as it impacts other's judgments.  Eventually even the slightly longer hair style I wore in high school was revoked from me after my parents secretly scheduled me a haircut, gave me a 3 minutes heads up, and my mother screamed at me until I would submit and have her drive me there and tell them to cut it short.  I couldn't look in the mirror for a week without my feeling nauseous.  Any time someone brought up my hair I felt my stomach do a flip and skin felt like pins and needles.  After two years of college, and more forced haircuts, I finally broke down crying to my mom over the phone telling her I couldn't take another haircut.  This also led to me telling her that I'm interested in guys (I said I was bisexual, though over time I feel like I lean more towards being gay) as the conversation progressed as I was afraid she'd draw conclusions, and I thought I might as well get it out of the way.  Her reaction, while shocked was neither positive or negative, and she hopes it's just a phase though was never nasty to me about it.

The other element to this story is that a good deal of my sexual attraction...is based around hair.  I love guys with long hair, and want to be able to pull off the look myself.  Even when a guy doesn't have long hair I find myself staring whenever someone has a particularly pretty hairstyle.  Even though I prefer guys, girls can have memorizing hairstyles as well.  A particularly pretty hair braid, a colorful pixie cut, I love it all so much.  Having somewhat of a hair fetish makes my predicament even more painful to me, as I often wish I could put my hair in a fancy bun or a fishtail braid.

Last, and fair warning this is really weird.  But for as long as I can remember, I have had a haircutting fetish.  I'm sexually aroused by watching mostly women have their hair cut very short or completely shaved off.  There's no sexual content in these videos/images, just hair cutting.  Perhaps this was a development due to my complete lack of freedom regarding my own hair and ability to be feminine.  I can't really explain why I have such a fetish, but I just do.  It was essentially all I would view for sexual pleasure in my high school years, though over time I distanced myself from it as it was upsetting to me to be aroused by something like that.  Having my haircut short mimics the feelings of humiliation and punishment present in some of those videos and makes me feel like I'm being disgraced.  Hence the not being able to look in a mirror after my cuts.  It makes me feel sub-human.

This also led to me telling her that I\'m interested in guys (I said I was bisexual, though over time I feel like I lean more towards being gay) as the conversation progressed as I was afraid she\'d draw conclusions, and I thought I might as well get it out of the way.  Her reaction, while shocked was neither positive or negative, and she hopes it\'s just a phase though was never nasty to me about it.\n\nThe other element to this story is that a good deal of my sexual attraction...is based around hair.  I love guys with long hair, and want to be able to pull off the look myself.  Even when a guy doesn\'t have long hair I find myself staring whenever someone has a particularly pretty hairstyle.  Even though I prefer guys, girls can have memorizing hairstyles as well.  A particularly pretty hair braid, a colorful pixie cut, I love it all so much.  Having somewhat of a hair fetish makes my predicament even more painful to me, as I often wish I could put my hair in a fancy bun or a fishtail braid.\n\nLast, and fair warning this is really weird.  But for as long as I can remember, I have had a haircutting fetish.  I\'m sexually aroused by watching mostly women have their hair cut very short or completely shaved off.  There\'s no sexual content in these videos/images, just hair cutting.  Perhaps this was a development due to my complete lack of freedom regarding my own hair and ability to be feminine.  I can\'t really explain why I have such a fetish, but I just do.  It was essentially all I would view for sexual pleasure in my high school years, though over time I distanced myself from it as it was upsetting to me to be aroused by something like that.  Having my haircut short mimics the feelings of humiliation and punishment present in some of those videos and makes me feel like I\'m being disgraced.  Hence the not being able to look in a mirror after my cuts.  It makes me feel sub-human.\n\n***\n\nThat turned out considerably longer than I expected.  If anyone here as some words of wisdom or thoughts on my situation, please comment.  I\'ve been pretty distressed by the thought of having to part with my hair.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': ""I'm afraid I might be Forced to get a haircut in the search for a Job"", 'created': 1470571562.0}"

I've been seriously questioning my gender for about a month now. I'm 22, AFAB, but for most of my life I've gone through periods where I just...feel more like a guy. There's never been any serious dysphoria associated with it - unless you count general self-consciousness and body image crap, but that's always there. It's only recently that I've come to realize that there might actually be something going on (I even picked out a more masculine name - Kai - although goodness knows if I'll ever be brave enough to use it).
And after lots of research and lots of thinking, I've been able to (kind of) come out as genderqueer to my mom. She took it pretty well, but now, suddenly, I'm having doubts. Am I just tying to be Special? Is this even valid? What if it's a phase and I'm just a poser trying to get attention? I want to come out to my friends, but I'm scared to death.
...I'm sure at least some of you have dealt with feelings like this. How did you get past them? I really want to start binding and presenting as masculine and experimenting with this, but I have all these conflicting feelings that I can't seem to get past...any advice would be fantastic.

Well...I did it. I'm now officially out. I bought a binder and have started wearing it - more on that in a sec - and over the past few days I've been slowly coming out to my friends, one by one. It doesn't get any less scary, no matter how many times I say the words, but damn. The amount of love and support and encouragement I've gotten has been astonishing. I had no idea. I just...damn. I feel so lucky.
I'm still not really out to my family; my dad in particular leans more toward the conservative, and I don't think he'd ever understand or accept it.

Binding has been an experience. Actually putting the damn thing on was a Herculean effort all by itself. But wearing it out and about felt awesome.

It feels so. good. to finally be out. It's a lot of work, but I'm more comfortable in my skin than I think I've ever been.

While thinking about this I came with a quick exercise that gave me some relief and I thought it can help someone else too.

It's simple. Take a piece of paper, a notebook, journal or whatever you like and write down:

* Things you already have that let you be gender-fluid. Maybe you have beautiful hair or sharp facial features?

* Things you can wear that already fit you. You have legs perfect for leggings or square shoulders which make that jacket fit right?

* Other easy things you can do with your body. Ear piercings? Cut down your hair? Wear makeup? Grow out your brows?
