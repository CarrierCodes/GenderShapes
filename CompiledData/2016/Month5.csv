I now help to train staff at CAMHS (started at the hospital I attended, now working with all Trusts in South West London, possibly moving to a bigger area/national later on) on how to best care for transgender young people. At this time I can only talk about my own experiences and those of two or three friends of mine, but would like to have more opinions/experiences to quote, to give the best advice I can. The more experiences I can draw information from, the better the training I can give, and ultimately the better treatment trans kids will get.

I am a college student but when I am on break, I live with my parents and grandparents (my mother's parents). I have been out to my mother since freshman year in high school as a ""lesbian"" and she's been cool with it, although we never really talk about it (I did mention when she picked me up from college this year that I was sorta seeing someone at the time and she seemed pretty chill about it). 


However, I'm struggling to mention my real gender identity to her and how I would like to medically transition (start taking low-dose testosterone so I am more comfortable in my body). Health insurance is awesome and all, but I'm not quite sure that I am ready to come out yet, and I know that the insurance billing gets sent to my house/parents, and I would wish to change that somehow. I'm listed as a dependent on the family health insurance (BCBS), but is there any way I can change the billing of my medical expenses/procedures to my personal address at college? Personally, I feel like it is not my parents' business of what I do medically unless I am ready to tell them/come out to them, but I am also unable to pay out-of-pocket for any therapy or treatments that I wish to go through to start my journey.


On the subject of hormone replacement therapy, I know you can't pick and choose the effects of hormones/testosterone, but I would like to get a lower voice (mine's really girly and high and makes me uncomfortable), squarer jaw, more muscle mass, and hairiness isn't a deal-breaker. I'm a bit nervous about bottom growth, as I do not have bottom dysphoria, and I'm afraid that a decent amount of growth might even give me a bit of bottom dysphoria, but I am pretty small (very, very small) to begin with, so I don't think it won't be a great issue. The reason why I would like to go on a lower dose of T (I know this relates to your own body and how your body handles hormones) is that as I do not identify as male, I do not want to fully present as ""male""/seem cis-male.

While these questions do not approach the debate in an effort to appeal to the inherent necessity of human rights of all people, (which should be all that should be needed) it is intended to debunk the most common arguments I see coming from these protesters (who appear to be ""traditional families"" and thats who i addressed it to.)

I ask because I have seen many a parent of both sexes nervously standing outside because of the social taboo of accompanying their child in a bathroom of the opposite sex.  I would think that the danger of an unaccompanied child makes a parent nervous, no matter the picture on the door.  A male predator in search of a female target would not lie in wait in the men's room, and vice versa for a male target.  (This applies to female predators too, but they do not seem to concern the general population as much.)

2)  As for possible adult victims, I posit a similar question.  Do you not feel safer entering a restroom in a group?  A male predator looking for a lone female would not hide in the mens room, but would hide in the womens room to wait for her (same for the opposite situation, and vice versa for same sex attacks.)  So if a male and female (couple, friends, etc) had the ability to use the same restroom, would this not enable the possibility of a safer environment from predators?

3)  If you have ever been in a non gendered personal environment (examples: festival showers, or ladies using the guys restroom while guys are there just because of an insane line, etc,) has that felt more or less safe than using a deserted facility that is (for lack of a better term) creepy?  

4)  Do you believe that the non gendering of bathrooms is vastly more likely to encourage predators, or do you think someone who plans to assault someone may not care about a bathroom policy since they are willing to assault another human?

5)  Do you believe that transgender people are more likely to commit assault? What do you believe differentiates this from the thought process that led to race segregated bathrooms, for fear that a black person was more likely to assault a white person?

I believe that having friends, family, or simply more people around is more likely to discourage assault than keeping the ""potential victims"" in an isolated environment where a predator knows they have no ""guardians.""  I personally feel safety in numbers, something present when girls go to a sketchy bathroom together but not possible when out with a male companion.  I believe families want to be able to watch over their offspring if they use a public restroom. I believe that the separation of the ""potential victims"" (women) from ""probable predators"" (men) perpetuates a dangerous rape culture.  I have used the mens room when the line was too long, and showered without fear among a room of all genders.  But thats me.  Tell me your thoughts.

I am also confused where the line would be drawn, and how it is to be enforced.  What of those born with traits of both genders? What of those that have had sex changes? Does a woman with masculine dress, features, appearance have to present her ""attributes"" to gain admission to the ladies room?  

On the other hand, I don't care for my SO to overhear me birth a Chipotle baby, nor do men want to wait in line like girls have to.  So there's that.  Now go forth and fight, hordes of the web. Because we are internet, we are angry.""

THIS IS A TERF WHO IS OPPOSING TRANSGENDER BATHROOM ACESS


You are posting falsehoods. Women and girls have experienced plenty of predatory behavior from cross-dressing and transgender males. In fact, they rape, beat and kill women at EXACTLY the same rates as non-transgender males. The problem is MALES being given the keys to LEGALLY enter women's and girls' safe spaces. They're bigger, stronger, more likely to sexually assault (98% of rapists are male) and transwomen are no different than other males in this regard. Women and girls DO NOT want naked male bodies in our showers, locker rooms, bathrooms, dressing rooms. If we didn't have a natural modesty and need female-only privacy in these intimate situations (e.g. changing into our bathing suits), we'd just rip off our clothes in the halls or next to the pool and flash the world. But we don't because we want privacy from the too-often predatory male gaze of strangers and we do NOT want to see his parts, either (thanks but no thanks, flashers!) Why have dressing rooms for women at all if you're going to introduce strange males into the rooms?

Susan, thank you for comments

What statement(s) is(are) falsehoods?

The data I provided is from the federal government. The claim by Dr. Jacobs was disproven via the letter from the Montgomery County Police Chief.

I've never been in a dressing room, whether it is at Nordstrom Rack, Kohls, Target, Macy's etc, where I'm changing in from of all other patrons using the room. They are locked enclosures with mirrors. 

As far as the items you ask to Google, 

If you are suggesting these are examples of how a law providing a transgender person full and proper access to all of the fruits of life ensured by all citizens of the country, then I sorry to inform you they do not.

Michelle Kosilek was married to Cheryl McCaul. Ms. McCaul was NOT murdered in a public changing room, a locker room, or a restroom nor as a result of a ""man"" gaining access to such a space because a law like this was on the books because no such laws existed in that jurisdiction when that crime was committed. Massachusetts added their law in 2011, 21 years after this murder, and it does NOT include public accommodations. Ms Kosilek transitioned AFTER convicted of her crime.

Thomas Lee Benson Milwaukie Oregon is a convicted sex offender with a record going back 17+ years. It is unlawful for him to go anywhere children are congregating, regardless of what he is wearing. ""Clackamas County Circuit Judge Steven L. Maurer found Benson guilty of second-degree criminal trespass, unlawful entry into a motor vehicle and frequenting a place where children regularly congregate, which is a crime for predatory sex offenders."" As with this law in Maryland, illegal acts remain illegal. In Oregon, laws are on the books to prevent discrimination for transgender people, and they too do not negate illegal activities such as those committed by Thomas Lee Benson.

Paul ""Pauline"" Witherspoon Dallas Texas, there is ""nothing"" Not sure what you wanted to highlight, other than a tertiary source at best just repeating the same jumbled mess of words you are.

Now, to Christopher Hambrook from Toronto. The ONLY information about this individual comes nearly two years AFTER these attacks occurred. 

The Toronto Sun writes :
""Shortly after his mother died in Montreal in February 2002, Hambrook committed the first of his sex crimes by sexually assaulted a family friend’s five-year-old daughter. While on bail waiting for courts to deal with charges laid for that crime, he targeted a 27-year-old mentally challenged woman, by sexually assaulting her in his home and forcing her to smoke a joint.

Hambrook received two years in jail for each of those crimes, for a total of four years.

“He had no empathy, no remorse or understanding of his victims of his offences,” Toronto psychiatrist Dr. Treena Wilkie said in her assessment.""

This is a delusional and psychiatrically disturbed individual who clearly cannot obey any law. The presence of lack of presence of trans rights laws, did not, nor will not ever stop him as witnessed by the psychiatric testimony offered by professionals.

Women and girls have experienced plenty of predatory behavior from cross-dressing and transgender males. In fact, they rape, beat and kill women at EXACTLY the same rates as non-transgender males. The problem is MALES being given the keys to LEGALLY enter women\'s and girls\' safe spaces. They\'re bigger, stronger, more likely to sexually assault (98% of rapists are male) and transwomen are no different than other males in this regard. Women and girls DO NOT want naked male bodies in our showers, locker rooms, bathrooms, dressing rooms. If we didn\'t have a natural modesty and need female-only privacy in these intimate situations (e.g. changing into our bathing suits), we\'d just rip off our clothes in the halls or next to the pool and flash the world. But we don\'t because we want privacy from the too-often predatory male gaze of strangers and we do NOT want to see his parts, either (thanks but no thanks, flashers!) Why have dressing rooms for women at all if you\'re going to introduce strange males into the rooms?

I'm a bisexual white cisgendered guy, part of the LGBT umbrella. I feel like at least in some small way, we're all on the same team fighting for acceptance in a world that in many ways (some more than others) we don't feel like we fit into. A close friend of mine, someone I grew up with since middle school, is a trans girl and the strength of our friendship or my acceptance of them has never wavered.

But I have a big thing I struggle with. My experiences with the trans community on the whole (being mostly Reddit but a few friends-of-friends that I've met) have been very negative. I've been verbally attacked because I'm a cis guy; I've had multiple debates (hell, one of them tonight, which led to this post!) where I've been dismissed and told 'cishet' is not an insult.

I feel like in literally every time I've tried to take a stand and do right by the trans community, I've been insulted for doing so. 

It makes every time I speak up harder than the last. I don't want to become apathetic to the struggles of a very marginalized group of people. The surest way for evil to prosper is for good people to do nothing, and marginalized groups need the majority on their side if persecution is going to end.

I'm a cis woman, in a relationship for the past year with my transfemme genderqueer partner. They came out as trans not long before we got together (we had already been friends for a few years), and has since been presenting very femme.

 A few months ago they decided to start hormones - but given the rubbish state of gender clinics here they got some estrogen from an older trans lady friend of ours (who is a general badass and kind of guide for younger trans folks in our scene) and more was to be procured online, along with anti-androgens, as a more steady supply and a higher dose. After just over 2 months on hormones (which they were feeling great about!) they ran out and customs issues have delayed more... It's now been almost a month since they've taken estrogen, and they're feeling shit about it. I know they'd been excited for the weather getting better and feeling more like dressing cute and stuff as their body changed, and they feel like that isn't going to happen, that they're backsliding and it'll soon be as if they never started at all. Coupled with their existing depression, and issues with their parents being unaccepting, this has had a bad effect on their mental health.

It was a rare sunny day today, and I woke and got up to find our housemates all in the mood to sit in our garden drinking tea. Knowing my partners insomnia and depression means sometimes they'll sleep through a fun buzz and feel shit about it later, I popped in to them in our room to see if they wanted to join us - bad call - I hadn't realised that they've actually gotten so low that they didn't want to be woken or awake (or alive really,tbh :( ) at all and have since been sitting in bed feeling like crap. I felt terrible about having woken them - and about how low they are generally.

As I said, it's warm, so I've been in shorts and a bikini top hanging about and doing things around the house, and have been also in and out to hang with them and see how they are doing.

I was making some food in the kitchen when I got a Facebook message from them - asking if I could wear something other than my bikini around them today as it was making them feel jealous and shit about their body. I said ok, and am now wearing a tshirt.

....but I am feeling *really* uneasy about the whole thing. I'm not going to raise it with my partner now - they're feeling so horrid and I don't want to add to that - people also don't tend to be their best most receptive selves when super duper low, so I don't think it would be productive from an ""us vs the problem"" standpoint anyway. I'm also not sure if this even is the problem I feel it might be - I'm hoping for some clarity here.

I wanted to field some thoughts from trans folks, particularly transfemme folks, about the whole thing, and gather my thoughts. The thought that me being around my partner dressed in very little makes them feel horrible about their own (beautiful!) body breaks my heart - and the idea of them having to sit there feeling that way if they want my company when they're down is an awful one.... But like I said, it feels weird, and wrong. I'm well aware that it isn't *at alllll* coming from the same place as the impetus on women to cover because of the lustful gaze of men - but feeling like I should be covering my body because of anybody else's reaction to it, whatever it may be and wherever it may come from, is a profoundly discomfiting one.

I'm trying really hard to be understanding. I'm totally open to the possibility that there's an element to this that I'm currently not seeing because I'm cis and my relationship to my gender and body is so different from theirs in this world, or because of my own emotional reaction to the idea of changing what I wear to suit somebody else(which I've only ever before encountered in the other form, the 'don't be slutty' 'cover your shame' form, so have a knee jerk defence reaction to)

This has been bothering me since October, when I came out to my dad's side of the family. My dad, bless him, has done his research and tries to call me by my name, but fails miserably in real life. The problem here is my grandparents. They pretty much raised me, I lived with them ages 3/4 - 10-ish, and after that I sort of became distant and it hurt them a lot. I didn't mean to, but it was because of their attitude towards everything. They're racist, homophobic and the worst bit, transphobic. When my grandmother was told I was trans she said I was having a sex change (as if it's one simple little snip) and that top surgery was mutilation (when that's the thing I want so badly) and it hit really hard. Obviously, they're old, in their 70's now. They have old fashioned values. They're from a dodgy bit of London and they don't like anything out of the ordinary. Okay, I've rambled enough about the background situation. The main problem is, my grandmother has pretty recently been diagnosed with dementia, and forgets things. She has forgotten I am trans, and my family won't help me to tell her. My dad got angry when I told him that her constant use of female pronouns, my old name, anything feminine towards me was hurting me so badly. He said if I dare blame her, he's going to get angrier. I live fully as male, my mum's side (parents are divorced and don't talk) all call me by my right name and pronouns and have been absolutely fantastic.

In my experience, scarves tend to be worn more by females than males, which would increase how feminine one looks. However, they also seem to be disproportionately frequently worn by gay men. Since MAABs looking to appear androgynous may adopt other traits associated with gay men, for example wearing bright colors, skinny jeans, and having a relatively high voice, wearing a scarf may lead people to conclude that a MAAB looking to present androgynous is actually a gay man.

22,2016-05-04 13:18:27,4huf1w,22,35,"This was originally posted on my blog, but I thought it would be valuable to share on here too:

As many of my close friends and family are aware I came out as a transgender female in early 2015. Almost immediately after telling everyone in my life that I actually felt more like a girl inside, I went through a process of shedding my male identity and replacing it with a female one. I took social and medical steps to achieve this identity and change my outward appearance and lifestyle in a desperate attempt to “pass” as a female in society. This included such things as growing out my hair, wearing makeup and replacing my wardrobe of tshirts and jeans with skirts, dresses and cardigans. I began hormone replacement therapy to give myself the chemical make up of a female. In doing so I induced a second puberty, through which I watched my body morph into something more feminine over a period of 12 months.


There has been much soul searching and re-evaluation of my decision over this period. The main surprise was that as the excitement of this new found adolescence began to fade,  I had begun to miss many aspects of my old male self. Feeling further pressure to change things that I didn’t want to change, like my male voice, added to these feelings. I became severely confused and depressed, as I still had not found my answer as to whether I was truly male or female. Had I been correct in choosing to come out and transition?


Scared and confused, I locked my hormones in the drawer, pulled out my old guy clothes and went back to what had ben familiar for the last 28 years. It wasn’t long before I felt the distress of dysphoria creeping back in. Waking up in the morning and staring at my facial stubble and muscular build with a feeling of entrapment and resentment. Once again I popped back the pills and threw on some makeup and a skirt. Days passed and in certain moments, like going for a surf or watching the rugged men on Game of Thrones, I began to miss my beard and chiselled male body. The very thing I had wanted to rip from my existence only the day before!


This experience of swinging backwards and forwards every few day would continue and to this day it hasn’t stopped. I have gone on and off hormones and switched my wardrobe several times since. With a growing awareness of the trans community and the gender spectrum, I began to find people who identified as “non-binary”, who felt that they were something outside of the box of male and female. One day I stumbled across the term that resonated perfectly with what I had been experiencing my entire life and had become more prominent since I had fallen down the gender rabbit hole…. I am genderfluid


My experience of being male or female constantly changes over time. Sometimes I feel masculine, sometimes feminine, sometimes androgynous and sometimes no gender at all. With this new insight, I once again “came out” to the people close in my life. I now go by the pronouns they/them as well as she/her and I change my physical presentation based on how masculine or feminine I feel on any given day. I have gone from “transforming” to just “being” and stripping away limitations instead of trying to squeeze myself into some pre-conceived box.


I am still in the process of learning to accept myself as genderfluid and navigating the practicalities of living with a non-binary identity. Transitioning from one binary gender to another is extremely difficult, but living outside the two boxes that society prescribes brings a lot of unique challenges. What bathrooms do I use? What hormones should I have? What box do I tick when I’m filling out a form and it only has two bloody options!?  

Although facing change is difficult, I have gained so much freedom from societal expectations in the process. No matter where I end up, I have no regrets for what I have been through and where I am now. There is no greater privilege in life than owning ones self.

Almost immediately after telling everyone in my life that I actually felt more like a girl inside, I went through a process of shedding my male identity and replacing it with a female one. I took social and medical steps to achieve this identity and change my outward appearance and lifestyle in a desperate attempt to “pass” as a female in society. This included such things as growing out my hair, wearing makeup and replacing my wardrobe of tshirts and jeans with skirts, dresses and cardigans. I began hormone replacement therapy to give myself the chemical make up of a female. In doing so I induced a second puberty, through which I watched my body morph into something more feminine over a period of 12 months.\n\n\nThere has been much soul searching and re-evaluation of my decision over this period. The main surprise was that as the excitement of this new found adolescence began to fade,  I had begun to miss many aspects of my old male self. Feeling further pressure to change things that I didn’t want to change, like my male voice, added to these feelings. I became severely confused and depressed, as I still had not found my answer as to whether I was truly male or female. Had I been correct in choosing to come out and transition?\n\n\nScared and confused, I locked my hormones in the drawer, pulled out my old guy clothes and went back to what had ben familiar for the last 28 years. It wasn’t long before I felt the distress of dysphoria creeping back in. Waking up in the morning and staring at my facial stubble and muscular build with a feeling of entrapment and resentment. Once again I popped back the pills and threw on some makeup and a skirt. Days passed and in certain moments, like going for a surf or watching the rugged men on Game of Thrones, I began to miss my beard and chiselled male body. The very thing I had wanted to rip from my existence only the day before!\n\n\nThis experience of swinging backwards and forwards every few day would continue and to this day it hasn’t stopped. I have gone on and off hormones and switched my wardrobe several times since. With a growing awareness of the trans community and the gender spectrum, I began to find people who identified as “non-binary”, who felt that they were something outside of the box of male and female. One day I stumbled across the term that resonated perfectly with what I had been experiencing my entire life and had become more prominent since I had fallen down the gender rabbit hole…. I am genderfluid\n\n\nMy experience of being male or female constantly changes over time. Sometimes I feel masculine, sometimes feminine, sometimes androgynous and sometimes no gender at all. With this new insight, I once again “came out” to the people close in my life. I now go by the pronouns they/them as well as she/her and I change my physical presentation based on how masculine or feminine I feel on any given day. I have gone from “transforming” to just “being” and stripping away limitations instead of trying to squeeze myself into some pre-conceived box.\n\n\nI am still in the process of learning to accept myself as genderfluid and navigating the practicalities of living with a non-binary identity.

Recently, 3 days ago, I discovered that I want to be a woman. Ever since then I've felt this sense of fulfillment, acceptance, giddyness and especially euphoria whenever I think about the fact that I want to be a woman. But at the same time I have this constant feeling of ''despair'' or depressed feeling which I can only describe to be nervousness and uncertainty both at the same time. That feeling is really eating on me and has been the main motivator as to why I am writing this. I've thought a lot about what could cause this feeling to appear and I've not been able to find a clear cut answer as for why these negative feelings are nearly constantly here. The closest answer I could find was the fact that when I completely relax, remove outside influences and my ego from my conscious mind, I would basically only feel that '' euphoric happiness'' as I described a short while ago. When that happens I feel completely relaxed, calm, happy, accepting of death etc. Euphoric basically. Man I am repeating myself now. Anywho, usually after an hour of feeling euphoric, thoughts of doubt and uncertainty creep in again. Primarily thoughts such as; ''What if the feelings of wanting to become a woman leave???, I don't want it to leave!!!'' 
The worst part of thoughts like that is that I don't know if it originates from the right place or the wrong place inside of me. Is it the social construct me that is clinging onto its last breaths or is it &gt;me&lt; telling me that I am not actually a woman, even though a rather powerful feeling inside of me is telling me I am.

Hopefully I've given a pretty clear view of how things are now. That way I can tell you about how I got to this point my ''Origins'' story if you want to put it like that.

Since a couple of months ago I got into sissy hypnos. It was a bit of an on and off relationship. Sometimes I'd watch and regret watching it afterwards and other times I would have periods during which I didn't touch the genre at all, but my fap interests were always specifically centered around TG (SIDENOTE: ''Played quite a bit of Trap Quest'') and some very obscure fetish. before I ever found out about sissyhypnos I would occasionally cross-dress, but that would only happen when I had refrained from fapping for 4 days to 2 weeks. SIDENOTE: ''I specifically remember that I enjoyed feeling pretty while doing so.'' Anyway, please know that I've given that bit of background information so I can get to the important part, which was the last 4 weeks up until now. 4 weeks ago I decided to start nofap/no porn (For the most part noporn) my main motivation being the whole Opioid/Dopamine system rewiring your brain article which I read about on a nofap site (Don't want to go back there, it makes me feel negative) I read it because I was fapping to some weird shit, so I thought that a 3 month nofap would definitely rewire my brain to its natural state. But when my Ergonomics doctor, who I went to regarding my RSI, told me that I cannot game for the next 2 weeks (Or stress my right arm at all for that matter.) During those 2 weeks I had Holiday. So, I thought; ''No Gaming during my vacation? Fuck, I'm going to relapse.'' And that's exactly what happened. I relapsed on the very first fucking saturday even. Didn't even regret it for a bit afterwards. On that following Monday however I purged. SIDENOTE: ''In the sense of deleting all the content/browser history and regretting my relapse a bit.'' This after purge purity continued until Wednesday when my mind pulled me back and brilliantly decided to start considering to involve weed into the equation. Absolutely no stopping my desires for this experimentation I got me some money and bought me some quality weed with a friend of mine. He smoked a bit of the stash with me. He is completely ignorant regarding my motive etc. (SIDENOTE: ''He was there Friday to sunday'') during which I strangely had gay fantasies about him. (BIG SIDENOTE: ''Remember, that what I just said was last week. FYI Timelines can be a little fucked up because I always binged on hypnos/audios during the following nights. My brain's a little hazy regarding times. + On that sunday I decided to finally start strictly following the sissy feminization program I found online somewhere'') 
After those days I used the remaining part of the stash to get high while watching hypnos and listening to feminization audio files. SIDENOTE: ''I vividly remember that right before everytime I did that I had to calm my eagerness down before I could get into it, so I could avoid bad trips i.e nasty heart palpitations.'' Anyway, Tuesday was the last day of me getting high while listening to feminization audio files. But it was also the strongest, I remember that during that day (SIDENOTE: ''Or the night before, not sure.'') I calmly listened to a one and a half an hour estrogen beat release file after which I certainly felt more female (INTERESTING SIDENOTE: ''Has/had me thinking of the possibility that the added estrogen has caused a hormonal imbalance inside me thus resulting in my current confusion'') but that's not all, because on that Tuesday night (Or morning) I listened to an audio file which I feel like changed my life (SIDENOTE: ''I believe it was made by Goddess Lucie.'') the file was about letting my inner woman out and it feels like it actually did. In the file it described euphoria, fulfillment etc. I felt everything it described so intensely. When my inner woman was coming out, I felt a part of me struggling at first, but as soon as I once again turned off my brain, everything became so intensely blissful and I felt so fulfilled. The next day I was doing pretty fine, I felt like I had to give the woman inside of me more room to breathe by shoving my ''ego'' aside. Had some strange fears saying that perhaps the woman inside was too submissive to come out etc. During that whole day however I didn't feel even a bit of despair, just acceptance, I was just spending the day making it more clear to myself that I am a woman. The kind of despair I described a while ago. But the day after that, that's when the situation started to worsen. Doubts started entering, only little by little, but barely noticeable. On that very day though I told a friend of mine that I am transgender, because a strong feeling inside of me told me that I had to and it was eating on me rapidly, so I gave in. After I basically; ''came out'' I felt soooooo relieved and fulfilled. He knew I had doubts so he helped me create a plan of what to do for the next 3 months and that's pretty much hypertrophy training combined with nofap/noporn. He said; ''Mens sana in Corpore Sano.'' And I agreed. The following day however (SIDENOTE: ''Still pretty much today, because the last time I slept was on the night I made those plans with that friend'') is when the despair fully kicked in and now everything is as I described, in this post a long way back up.

Essentially, I am pretty sure that I am depressed. And I don't know whether the depression is indicating that I am on the path to becoming me or if it's indicating that I am becoming not me.

BTW, as of late, I've barely been eating anything.

Not sure if this subreddit is the right place. So please excuse me if this is not the right place for this type of post.

If you were able to follow the whole story, I congratulate you. Right now I am not in a good state for making things very constructive. I made this post on a rather emotional basis and I apologize profusely for that, since that's a reason as to why this post is such a confusing mess. From the moment I post this I will regularly improve any mistakes I've made and make things more clear if they were unclear.

EDIT: I made a lot of probably not important sidenotes in this post. I will just tag every single one of 'em as a sidenote.


I will sleep now and patiently wait for some hopefully positive affirmations of how I feel inside.

I calmly listened to a one and a half an hour estrogen beat release file after which I certainly felt more female (INTERESTING SIDENOTE: ''Has/had me thinking of the possibility that the added estrogen has caused a hormonal imbalance inside me thus resulting in my current confusion'') but that's not all, because on that Tuesday night (Or morning) I listened to an audio file which I feel like changed my life (SIDENOTE: ''I believe it was made by Goddess Lucie.'') the file was about letting my inner woman out and it feels like it actually did. In the file it described euphoria, fulfillment etc. I felt everything it described so intensely. When my inner woman was coming out, I felt a part of me struggling at first, but as soon as I once again turned off my brain, everything became so intensely blissful and I felt so fulfilled. The next day I was doing pretty fine, I felt like I had to give the woman inside of me more room to breathe by shoving my ''ego'' aside. Had some strange fears saying that perhaps the woman inside was too submissive to come out etc. During that whole day however I didn't feel even a bit of despair, just acceptance, I was just spending the day making it more clear to myself that I am a woman. The kind of despair I described a while ago. But the day after that, that's when the situation started to worsen. Doubts started entering, only little by little, but barely noticeable. On that very day though I told a friend of mine that I am transgender, because a strong feeling inside of me told me that I had to and it was eating on me rapidly, so I gave in. After I basically; ''came out'' I felt soooooo relieved and fulfilled. He knew I had doubts so he helped me create a plan of what to do for the next 3 months and that's pretty much hypertrophy training combined with nofap/noporn. He said; ''Mens sana in Corpore Sano.'' And I agreed. The following day however (SIDENOTE: ''Still pretty much today, because the last time I slept was on the night I made those plans with that friend'') is when the despair fully kicked in and now everything is as I described, in this post a long way back up.\n\nEssentially, I am pretty sure that I am depressed. And I don't know whether the depression is indicating that I am on the path to becoming me or if it's indicating that I am becoming not me.\n\nBTW, as of late, I've barely been eating anything.\n\nNot sure if this subreddit is the right place. So please excuse me if this is not the right place for this type of post.\n\nIf you were able to follow the whole story, I congratulate you. Right now I am not in a good state for making things very constructive. I made this post on a rather emotional basis and I apologize profusely for that, since that's a reason as to why this post is such a confusing mess. From the moment I post this I will regularly improve any mistakes I've made and make things more clear if they were unclear.\n\nEDIT: I made a lot of probably not important sidenotes in this post. I will just tag every single one of 'em as a sidenote.\n\n\nI will sleep now and patiently wait for some hopefully positive affirmations of how I feel inside. Affirmations may not be the best word for this, because affirmations come from yourself, and I am looking for that but from others. Most of all I am looking for the cold hard truth, I don't want to be living a lie!"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Transgender affirmations. (Genetic Male)', 'created': 1462538520.0}"

40,2016-05-07 14:20:49,4ia5a6,0,11,"So this post will go up on my blog soon, but I like to share directly to this subbreddit as you guys were the inspiration for everything I've achieved in my transition journey. So here it is:

So this week marks one year since I publicly came out as trans and started my hormone transition. So I would like to wish my girl side a very happy first birthday! (She has always been the younger one it would seem). I thought I would celebrate by sharing some reflections on my experience. After all, coming out as transgender certainly isn’t something most people get to do in a lifetime!
 
It goes without saying that everyone’s coming out story is unique. I feel almost slightly shameful to admit that with all things considered, I have had it very easy. My experience was overwhelmingly smooth and positive, which I owe entirely to how beautiful the people in my life are. It felt like it only took a few words and overnight every one of my friends, family and work colleagues embraced my new gender identity, pronouns and name without question. I was completely caught off guard that overnight I would become a female in most people’s eyes and those who hadn’t processed the jump, put in every effort they could to make it happen. I know a lot of these people will be reading this post, so I would like to take the opportunity to express how grateful I am and how much love I have for every one of you.

Unfortunately, a major portion of people who go through this change aren't so lucky. Unlike them, I will never have to experience being disowned by my family or have all of my friends walk away from me. I will never experience violence being turned against me by the very people I love. I will never experience losing my job solely because of my gender identity. I will never experience being homeless simply for living my own life. I will never have to sell my body just to stay alive. I will never ride the dark, downward spiral of self-abuse and suicide that is an all too frequent destination for many gender non-conforming people. (A massive touch wood on all of the above)

It would seem pretty surreal to imagine that this could be possible in the modern world, but sadly I have met a lot of people who have lived through some aspect of this experience. It’s even more painful to process that there is one person I had befriended in the last year who is sadly no longer alive.

When I came out, I did it with a full acceptance that something horrible could happen to me. I didn’t have any reason to believe it would, after all everyone in my life is pretty rad, but I had heard a lot of horror stories from people who thought they were in a similar situation. At the time when I finally announced publicly that I wasn’t like “100% a dude”, I have never honest-to-god been more terrified in my life. I have nearly drowned while surfing, I have come within fifteen meters of a tiger shark, I have nearly collided mid-air while skydiving and not to mention how many times I’ve nearly set myself on fire or blown my hands off during my pyromaniac pre-teen years. All that and the thought of saying a few words had me completely shitting in my pants.

All I can say without going into extreme detail (which I will soon) is that I took the leap, because I knew in my heart that my life would be fake and wasted if I didn’t at least try. Life is way too short to not live in a way that feels natural and allows you to express yourself freely. The people around you are really missing out if they don’t get the full package and by stepping out from the same-old-same-old you encourage others to try the things that they’ve always wanted to do.

I think we are actually entering a very fortunate time in human history, with the way technology and social media platforms are rapidly connecting people with others outside of their bubbles. It isn’t hard these days for any fish out of water to look online and realise there is a whole ocean of fish out there. I know I owe a lot of my journey of self-acceptance to the likes of YouTube, Tumblr and Reddit. It would seem that with this greater human connection we are seeing a growing respect for a person’s right to self-determination and we are in a more supportive place than ever to try something new.

So one year ago I came out as trans and it turns out that my gut was right, the people in my life are pretty rad.

That's my first annoyance with all these millennial terms being printed.  My second annoyance is with the concept of choice when it comes to gender.  You certainly can choose how you label yourself, and how you live your life.   But you don't get to redefine words to inject the concept of choice into a word that denies it traditionally.  That requires a new word.

What people want to be, male/female/other is composed of a few components.  The first is physical.  The second is... culture.  The role, behavior, mindset, expectation, self-awareness of gender is cultural.  A human raised by a strange otherwordly species of aliens with no concept of gender would not have gender either, outside of the physical parts.

Oh, but what of the longings, you ask?  Well some longings are cultural like how to dress and walk and even move your eyes, but I assume the one part left out so far is sex, love, non-familial affection.  Unfortunately, you can't have acceptance of homosexual desires and the belief that longings are part of gender identity.  It's not a consistent belief.  You can't say a gay man is actually a woman with a man's parts, but that's what you are saying if you want longings to be part of gender identity.

Culture, and physical.  There's nothing else.  Therefore there's no such thing as non-binary, because neither of these two sources of the actual word gender understands anything other than male or female (with some genetically accidental situations added in there of course, as with anything reliant on genetic code).

The number of concepts and lingo that have been invented in order to make sure everyone is labeled in a niche way as opposed to being part of a large group, and the temptation to believe oneself as transcendent of the masses, is a bridge too far.

 [This](http://www.wikihow.com/Look-Androgynous) says:
&gt; Avoid wearing soft and powdery colors like they're the plague. But you don't always have to wear bold, dark colors like black. Other colors can be neutral such as navy blue, forest green, brown, and black. Camouflage is a good pattern to stick with. 


However, I am unsure of if this is targeted towards everyone, or just FAABs.


I think I recall reading that it is best that that transwomen wear bright colors, which suggests that bright colors would increase androgyny for MAABs. Furthermore, females seem to wear brighter colors more often than males due, which also suggests that bright colors would increase androgyny for MAABs and decrease it for FAABs. Bright colors seem to grab attention, so if the clothing is more androgynous than the rest of the individual, this could increase androgyny for FAABs and MAABs.

However, bright colors seem to make busts or lack thereof more obvious, which could decrease androgyny.

Advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm American and have Medicaid, which in my state now covers trans related surgeries. Last year in the summer, I had a consult with a doctor for a vaginoplasty I was told it would happen within 3-6 months. Well, after being delayed multiple times, here we are in May and it hasn't happened. As of a couple weeks ago, the status was that they are backed up and are referring people to another doctor. I'm now on a waiting list for a consult with that doctor, which they claim will happen late summer (I'll believe that when I see it).

Good part at least is that the urologist, who was supposed to work with the plastic surgeon, was able to get me in for an orchiectomy, so I got that at least.

Last week, I found a doctor who would be willing to do a plain penectomy with no accompanying vaginoplasty, and he said he has an opening in a couple months. He doesn't take insurance though— cash only. It's significantly cheaper than the other procedure, but still several thousand dollars. 

Anyway, here comes my dilemma. Having a vagina was never as important for me as *not* having a penis. In fact, I never particularly wanted the vaginoplasty at all; it was just a means to an end.

Do I get nullification, which would be more desirable and sooner, but cost more, or vaginoplasty, which would be less desirable and in an uncertain timeframe, but is free? On a scale of desirability, penectomy would be at the top, vaginoplasty in the middle, and doing nothing way down at the bottom.

I'm not asking people to choose for me; I just want to talk to anyone that gets it. I have a few trans friends, but they are all mono gender and don't get the appeal of nullifcation, and everyone else in my life is not any type of queer and can't relate to this kind of surgery in the slightest.

The stories I'm finding online tend to be by cis gay men. That's great for them, but it's not the same, even if the procedure is.

Necklines affect androgyny in two ways: by being stereotypically associated with a gender and by downplaying or emphasizing masculine or feminine features. 


The necklines associated with females are generally ones that reveal more skin, which suggests that crew necks would be bad for AMABs and bad for AFABs.


As for downplaying or emphasizing features, boat necks [can](http://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/clothing/sweaters-tops/neckline) make broad shoulders look broader, but can ""offset"" wide hips. They are also typically associated with females, so these would probably be bad for both AFABs and AMABs.

Scoop-necks are bad for broad shoulders as well, but also emphasize ""a round, full face,"" suggesting they are bad for both AFABs and AMABs.

Turtle-necks [can](http://sillytranswoman.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-to-minimize-broad-shoulders.html?m=1) look very masculine, and could also hide a thin neck.

V-necks [can](http://www.teluguone.com/vanitha/content/right-neckline-for-your-body-71-23230.html) [help](https://www.seeitbagit.com/blogs/online-shoppers-magazine/39027393-how-to-pick-the-right-neckline-to-suit-you) with a thick neck, broad shoulders and a thick torso. However, v-necks [make](http://stylecaster.com/fashion-tips-to-make-you-look-taller/#slide-14) torsos appear longer.

Looser, more draped cowl-necks [can](http://sillytranswoman.blogspot.com/2014/01/how-to-minimize-broad-shoulders.html?m=1) have the same effect as v-necks do, and [can](http://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/clothing/sweaters-tops/neckline) also add bulk to the chest, which helps deal with small busts. They [are](http://www.thefashionpolice.net/2010/08/style-on-trial-cowl-necks-for-men.html) also very rarely worn by men.

From this analysis, crew neck and turtle-necks seem better than the other options for AFABs, and v-necks and looser, more draped cowl-necks seem to be better for AMABs, with the cowl-necks being best.

I know I am an inclusive person, and I know how Charlie feels towards pronouns, a discussion I have openly had with them, and I really feel it is important to respect my sweetheart with the terms they feel fit, but every so often I SCREW UP and say ""he"" or ""him"" in conversation, and I almost always feel regret afterward. I know Charlie realizes this is a part of growing culture, and accepts mistakes will be made, but as their girlfriend I feel like I need to be doing better, and as the one person who should understand and be respectful the most, every time I make a mistake I can feel a tension. I just want to be able to get it right, and I want to separate the amazing PIV sex with the gender term. I can't seem to shake the ingrained pronoun of him and he when it comes to casual conversation and I want to make Charlie feel like they can truly be themselves around me, and I just know every time I mess it up I take their progress and mine back a few notches. It happens most often when I am talking about Charlie and someone else refers to them with ""he/him"" and I find myself almost immediately afterwards reverting back to incorrect pronouns to accomodate the conversation. Is there any advice to training myself on androgynous pronouns? Is there any advice to help me get over my guilt when i make a mistake?

I actually told my aunt that ""it hurts me"" to wear a dress. 

In my 8th grade year we moved from rural MS to the capital, so I was exposed to much more liberal culture and friends.

I never knew what to do with my breasts. I've wished they weren't there since they came in and was in denial for a while until I was pulled aside and given the ""you _gotta_ get a bra"" talk. It's been sports bras ever since.

Fast forward to today. Now that I'm coming up on 25 and having been in a committed relationship with the woman of my dreams for 6 years, my understanding of my sexuality has been much more rounded out.

I suppose I didn't say anything because I didn't really understand it myself.
I finally told her that I hate my breasts and want to bind.. but that I am pretty certain I would never want to have surgery or hormone therapy and I also prefer female pronouns, though I don't feel upset when accidentally misgendered. Sensing my confusion she suggested I look into genderqueer.

.. I've never felt so genuine, accepted, and ""normal"" in my life. I was like ""There are more people like me!!!"" I love how broad the category can be because it leaves room for me to keep figuring all this out.

And by the way. My gf took me shopping for sports bras and undershirts last week and helped me look up exercises to get these beasts under control.

113,2016-05-16 18:09:16,4jmflv,10,7,"I was born female, and was always pretty gender neutral. My mother seems to prefer boys over girls and will always make them out to be the 'heroes' in a sense, as if they could do no wrong. 
I was also raised in a VERY Christian household where gay and anything different sexually was wrong. ( Which is funny because my mother and father are also extremely 'fluid'. My mom is very masculine and many people have mistaken her for a lesbian and my dad is more feminine and somewhat flamboyant.) 
I enjoyed hanging out with girls and boys, and was interested in both male and female activities. I played barbies into my early teens and always insisted on being the male character, I felt sexier and more powerful in that role. I would also play games with my girlfriends and be the boy character, and eventually began sleeping with my girlfriends in this male mindset. (This next part may sound weird, I believe it went this way because of how sheltered my living situation was.) 

This boy character from barbies, to 'playing' with my friends..almost became a second entity. A natural one of course, it was me. Just me as a male, and everything I wanted to be. (I would bind my breasts and wear boys clothes, which i still do. I shop in the boys section and feel much more confident in that style.) I started dating a girl I met at camp at 16, though never once thought of myself as a lesbian, it was in my head and hers, a straight male/female relationship. (I had been with boys too, and then and into my early 20's when I slept with males I felt I was a boy, sleeping with a boy) I would be a 'boy' around her and often fantasize about my life as him at home, writing about it and talking with close friends about it. Around my family I had to be a girl, which also came naturally. But I felt they were missing a piece of me. When we broke up after about 7 months I took it extremely hard and felt as though I lost myself.  

Like the 'boy' could no longer be without a girl there to see him. I dated other people, hooked up with other girls and guys along the way. I was very, very confused but pushed it under the rug, only acknowledging this boy as a game, or a fantasy. I began dating my best girl friend from childhood, and fell head over heels in love. (Mostly in my 'boy' role, which enables my confidence to seduce and feel attractive. She was actually the one who encouraged me to embrace him, and helped me understand who 'he' was, and how I felt.) 

We dated secretly, as I had with all the other girls I had been with, for about a year. I was about to turn 21 and was finishing up my degree, and after planning to move to NYC. The night before I was supposed to move, we were caught together by my mom. She was somehow aware of this boy I was emoting and she told me 'he' was not real and I had to stop. That night I broke up with the love of my life and went to NYC the next morning completely numb and heart broken...And traumatized.

 I moved in with a male roommate and began a strictly sexual relationship with him, I was desperately depending on him to make me not...whatever I was. 'Gay'.. as my mom would describe it. That relationship didn't work out and about a year later I moved back home. I reunited with my ex, in shambles, and we went through some very difficult transitional periods. (Me denying not only my sexuality, but almost ashamed of myself, and who was in every sense) As we got older and dated longer, I felt more open to be both male and female with her day to day. *Intimately I am strictly male. I view sex as a male, and feel as if I have male sexual organs and tendencies. Sex is also 'straight' for a lack of a better word. I enjoy being treated like a boy, and spoken to like a boy 100% of the time when intimate. 

In the past few years I have had ups and downs from panicking about my mom which at one point caused me to turn back to men to try to be 'straight'. I have sobbed on the kitchen floor from the brutal realization I will never 'grow up' to be the man I was striving to be. (When I think of the future with my girlfriend I see myself as a man with a wife and kids) I would often throw up because the whole process was terrifying.

Here is my biggest concern:

I feel bad/concerned for my girlfriend because I feel my perception and view on myself is constantly changing...There will be days I feel like I am a man, trapped in a woman's body, if I had the option to TRULY transition I would. I have days where I am no gender, I have days where I go back and forth from man to woman. I have days where I convince not only my girlfriend but MYSELF that I have never felt I am male, or want to be male. That I am just a confused girl...

I have days where I am fearful my girlfriend prefers my male side and that's not who I am. There are times where I only want her to like my male side, and treat me like I am a boy, only. There are days where I am feeling more feminine and want to be babied, and there are days I want to dress up and wear a little make up. (rare, but it happens) There are also times I do my makeup to be more angular and masculine. (I am androgynous, and have modeled for male and female photos) There are days where if I'm treated as a woman I feel upset and uncomfortable, and pray I could be a boy..I even want my children to call me ""Tayta"" Which means ""Father"" in a different language.. Every time someone sees me and my girlfriend and refers to us as 'girls' I cringe.. Because I don't like to be labeled or put in a box. Sometimes I wonder if I only want to be a boy because of how my mother views them, other times I know I do because that's how I see myself and how i feel. At times I speak in a lower voice, especially around my girlfriend and good friends, others I have my normal feminine voice. 

My male side, is me, and my feminine side is me. They can be intertwined, or completely separated. My feminine side usually happens throughout the day in blips, or when I'm extremely sensitive. They both are constants however, I never go a day without a moment of male and female tendencies. 

 I have such panic over it at times I began taking over the counter testosterone boosters to help. Which they did until my parents found them, that incident bringing back a lot of trauma and bad memories. I stopped taking it, and have been feeling really guilty and that feeling of shame. (It's been 5 weeks since I stopped and I have noticed this struggle is becoming a prominent issue again.)

When I'm dreaming I am usually male, though sometimes a female. Sometimes I switch back and forth and sometimes I'm neither sex. I refuse to label myself, even as genderqueer, though my girlfriend will sometimes mention it when I'm being irrational. And I don't like it, because I don't want to be trapped by a gender identity. I understand she just wants to understand what I am going through, and I make it very hard to figure that out. Even for myself.
 
 I do feel bad for her and understand her confusion because I am all over the place at times... I will convince her I'm a man trapped in a woman's body 75% of the time, and then the next day I'm saying none of what I said before is true and I'm just a girl who is very confused. A girl who looks up to men and wishes she could be like them, to avoid societies views on women. I am a girl who is happy to be a girl, like me as a girl.
And then once again, within an hour, or a day, I am feeling male and want to be viewed as such. (??)
I want her to call me her boy, or boyfriend. I want to be called by a more masculine nick name. I want to be her man. I want her to say things to me, she would say to a man. 

It goes back and forth. *She often says it happens a few weeks before I get my period ( when I'm fertile) I become more sensitive and feminine, and I feel extremely unattractive and insecure in myself.
I am constantly saying I don't know who I am, and I don't know how I feel about myself. Which I'm sure is scary for my girlfriend...(I know I'm in love with her and want to be with her, and her only. I just don't know whats going on inside me.)

She says its hard because I'm always back and forth about my gender. Which she wouldn't mind if I wasn't so bothered by the whole thing. And also that I change my story and opinion so often.
 For example: If I'm in a more feminine mindset or neutral, and I start questioning the male, and she begins indulging in my male side, I become protective of my female side.
There have been times in my life I feel completely myself, and the male and female kinda squish together and I'm just me. 

I come off almost as gender fluid, androgynous. And I'm comfortable that way. 
But there is a huge difference between the 'personalities' at times. And I can't seem to stay one way. I can't control it. If I could, I would want to stay 'boy' forever. 
But we all change..
I am thinking about proposing..and thinking about having children also concerns me because of my personality changes. The way it's going I believe they will think they have three parents...Their mom, their other mom and their dad. 
What do you think this is?

Am I gender queer? Am I bigender? Am I gender fluid? Am I crazy? haha. How can I help this situation for myself? 
Is there a way to maintain a personality? Or will it constantly change?
If anyone older has experienced this, does it balance out? Or will I always feel completely back and forth and out of control of myself?

Thanks for reading, hope this makes sense. (I wrote this quickly, sorry for any errors.)
I'm sincerely looking forward to some opinions, advice and hopefully answers.

142,2016-05-20 07:10:49,4k738p,7,7,"Sorry this is very long, and sorry if it's in the wrong place. It's my first ever post on reddit and I'm not sure how everything works here. I posted this to tumblr but got nothing back, so I figured I'd post it here because I'd really appreciate your thoughts.

I honestly hate that I can’t figure out what my gender identity is. Can someone read all this and talk to me about what they think? I’m just gonna ramble a ton here about exactly what I thoughts are and hopefully you people can help. I previously made a post on tumblr kinda like it [here](http://theanglomenagerie.tumblr.com/post/142034919820/coming-out-as-trans-why-international-transgender). Bullet points here because I don’t have the energy to make this a cohesive paragraph, but its all related in some way to my gender identity issues. Sorry this is 8 years long, but I always want people to know 100%.

Simple summary is that I don’t know if I’m just a confused cis girl with serious penis envy, or in some way trans. I’m really not that physically uncomfortable in my body, and don’t have a pronoun preference. I’m lazy and don’t want to fight for change and acceptance of nonbinary genders because I feel like they will never fit properly into our society. And if I am trans, I wouldn’t want to medically transition because it’s too hard/complex. But if I didn’t transition I would never pass and life would be endless discrimination. How should I live my life in a way that won’t cause much judgement/discrimination for my gender identity, and make me the happiest? (Yeah, you obviously won’t know what makes me happy, but what are your opinions?)

*Disclaimer that this post is 98% my opinions and I hope you can respect that and not flame me for them. I’m not trying to discredit transguys here in any way whatsoever.*

First, some of my opinions on gender, society, and pronouns

Gender and sex are different things. Sex is your chromosomes/biology and there is male, female, and intersex. Gender is boy, girl, and non-binary/a ton of other stuff.

Being non-binary in society is very hard and stressful because our society was built around 2 sexs/genders.

“Tumblrinas”, extreme SJW’s, and special snowflakes are treated like a joke in the majority of the “real world” and I don’t want to been seen like that because it can affect employment 
and serious stuff.

I’m hesitant to publicly use labels like “genderqueer” and such, for the above reasons.

I don’t really have much preference for pronouns, but again, in society using singular “they” is a challenge for some people and I don’t want to be seen as a special snowflake.

I understand that you should “be the change you want to see” but frankly, I’m lazy. I also really don’t like to be the odd person out trying to break the mold when it comes to LGBT+ stuff in daily society. 


Stuff about me personally

I’m a very scientific person and prefer logic and scientific fact above opinion and feelings.

I was born and raised female, and have XX chromosomes.

The only thing I’m 100% sure of in regards to gender/sexuality is that I’m sexually attracted to men. I generally just say bisexual though, because I think I’m romantically attracted to women and it’s easier.

Anal sex is terrifying to me and I would never do it/hate reading about it. Similar thoughts apply to oral sex on women. Vaginas kinda gross me out. (So this kind of rules out being a gay man in a relationship with gay cis men)

I don’t know if I’m sexually attracted to men, or just penises.

I’ve never actually had sex/a real romantic relationship, so take some of this with a grain of salt.

I’m don’t really get physical gender dysphoria. More of just gender confusion. I’m relatively comfortable in my body, besides the regular qualms like “my butt is too flat”


My history

I was a super tomboy as a kid and wore all boys clothes and did mostly boys hobbies

I was always really excited when people would “misgender” me as a boy, but I hid it from my parents because they teased me about it.

My parents were pretty cool with the boys clothes and stuff. They teased me a bit but they were generally supportive and let me do what I wanted without much restraint.

I remember praying in church that I hoped I would wake up with a penis one day.

I would always feel super awkward when at school they would have you separated into boys and girls groups, because I felt like I was the odd looking one out on the girls side. I wouldn’t want to go on the boys side either because I didn’t fit in there either and was afraid of being “called out” I guess.

Saying I wanted to be a boy was always my ""deep, dark secret"" as a kid that I probably only told my very close friends about. Never my family.

I was a tomboy until I was about 12.

I stopped dressing like a boy because I started to be sexually attracted to men, and realised the only way to attract them was to be girly

It’s been 7 years and men have never been interested in me. I’ve sort of given up. I assume they don’t like me because I’m not proper girly enough.


Some thoughts on medically transitioning

I realised being trans was a thing when I was maybe 15? I found youtube videos trans guys made and I got really excited because I felt like other people finally understood my yearnings as a kid, and there was something you could do about it.

I have no idea if I want to medically transition or not. Again, I’m really lazy and don’t really want to deal with all the costs, stigmas, time and energy it takes.

I don’t want to be a transsexual man. I want to be a cis male. I want an actual male XY chromosome body, and a working penis and such, not a prosthetic. Obviously this is impossible, so why would I bother with a transition if it will never be what I really want? (No offence is meant to trans guys here. If what you have works for you thats great! I just don’t know what I should pursue)

My anxiety/panic attacks almost always come from weird physical sensations, and since doctors generally don’t know everything about what side effects hormone treatment/testosterone has, I would have a bad time with all the changes testosterone gives you.

My talking voice would probably never pass, but I don’t really want to change it because I do a lot of singing and love being a soprano

My chest is big and binders don’t work very well because of it. I’m also super skinny and mens trousers never fit quite right on my twig legs. But on the flip side, female trousers are always sagy on my flat butt.

I live between the UK and USA so legally changing documents would be a mess and could jeopardise my visa.


Questions I have that I hope you can answer

I have no idea how to label myself and its stressing me out. How would you label me? 
Some things I’ve kinda identified with are genderqueer, non-binary, transmasculine, tomboy, and demiboy. Which of these (or others) do you think are the most accepted in everyday society?

Will I always be upset the whole rest of my life that I don’t have a real penis? Because that’s what it’s been like for pretty much my whole life in the past.

Do you think I should go to a gender counselor/doctor about this (since it is kinda consuming me) or should I be realistic and just be a female who dresses kinda androgynous?

Maybe just agender because let's be real, at the end of the day I’m a homosapien like everyone else.

It\'s my first ever post on reddit and I\'m not sure how everything works here. I posted this to tumblr but got nothing back, so I figured I\'d post it here because I\'d really appreciate your thoughts.\n\nI honestly hate that I can’t figure out what my gender identity is. Can someone read all this and talk to me about what they think? I’m just gonna ramble a ton here about exactly what I thoughts are and hopefully you people can help. I previously made a post on tumblr kinda like it [here](http://theanglomenagerie.tumblr.com/post/142034919820/coming-out-as-trans-why-international-transgender). Bullet points here because I don’t have the energy to make this a cohesive paragraph, but its all related in some way to my gender identity issues. Sorry this is 8 years long, but I always want people to know 100%.\n\nSimple summary is that I don’t know if I’m just a confused cis girl with serious penis envy, or in some way trans. I’m really not that physically uncomfortable in my body, and don’t have a pronoun preference. I’m lazy and don’t want to fight for change and acceptance of nonbinary genders because I feel like they will never fit properly into our society. And if I am trans, I wouldn’t want to medically transition because it’s too hard/complex. But if I didn’t transition I would never pass and life would be endless discrimination. How should I live my life in a way that won’t cause much judgement/discrimination for my gender identity, and make me the happiest? (Yeah, you obviously won’t know what makes me happy, but what are your opinions?)\n\n*Disclaimer that this post is 98% my opinions and I hope you can respect that and not flame me for them. I’m not trying to discredit transguys here in any way whatsoever.*\n\nFirst, some of my opinions on gender, society, and pronouns\n\nGender and sex are different things. Sex is your chromosomes/biology and there is male, female, and intersex. Gender is boy, girl, and non-binary/a ton of other stuff.\n\nBeing non-binary in society is very hard and stressful because our society was built around 2 sexs/genders.\n\n“Tumblrinas”, extreme SJW’s, and special snowflakes are treated like a joke in the majority of the “real world” and I don’t want to been seen like that because it can affect employment \nand serious stuff.\n\nI’m hesitant to publicly use labels like “genderqueer” and such, for the above reasons.\n\nI don’t really have much preference for pronouns, but again, in society using singular “they” is a challenge for some people and I don’t want to be seen as a special snowflake.\n\nI understand that you should “be the change you want to see” but frankly, I’m lazy. I also really don’t like to be the odd person out trying to break the mold when it comes to LGBT+ stuff in daily society. \n\n\nStuff about me personally\n\nI’m a very scientific person and prefer logic and scientific fact above opinion and feelings.\n\nI was born and raised female, and have XX chromosomes.\n\nThe only thing I’m 100% sure of in regards to gender/sexuality is that I’m sexually attracted to men. I generally just say bisexual though, because I think I’m romantically attracted to women and it’s easier.\n\nAnal sex is terrifying to me and I would never do it/hate reading about it. Similar thoughts apply to oral sex on women. Vaginas kinda gross me out. (So this kind of rules out being a gay man in a relationship with gay cis men)\n\nI don’t know if I’m sexually attracted to men, or just penises.\n\nI’ve never actually had sex/a real romantic relationship, so take some of this with a grain of salt.\n\nI’m don’t really get physical gender dysphoria. More of just gender confusion. I’m relatively comfortable in my body, besides the regular qualms like “my butt is too flat”\n\n\nMy history\n\nI was a super tomboy as a kid and wore all boys clothes and did mostly boys hobbies\n\nI was always really excited when people would “misgender” me as a boy, but I hid it from my parents because they teased me about it.\n\nMy parents were pretty cool with the boys clothes and stuff. They teased me a bit but they were generally supportive and let me do what I wanted without much restraint.\n\nI remember praying in church that I hoped I would wake up with a penis one day.\n\nI would always feel super awkward when at school they would have you separated into boys and girls groups, because I felt like I was the odd looking one out on the girls side. I wouldn’t want to go on the boys side either because I didn’t fit in there either and was afraid of being “called out” I guess.\n\nSaying I wanted to be a boy was always my ""deep, dark secret"" as a kid that I probably only told my very close friends about. Never my family.\n\nI was a tomboy until I was about 12.\n\nI stopped dressing like a boy because I started to be sexually attracted to men, and realised the only way to attract them was to be girly\n\nIt’s been 7 years and men have never been interested in me. I’ve sort of given up. I assume they don’t like me because I’m not proper girly enough.\n\n\nSome thoughts on medically transitioning\n\nI realised being trans was a thing when I was maybe 15? I found youtube videos trans guys made and I got really excited because I felt like other people finally understood my yearnings as a kid, and there was something you could do about it.\n\nI have no idea if I want to medically transition or not. Again, I’m really lazy and don’t really want to deal with all the costs, stigmas, time and energy it takes.\n\nI don’t want to be a transsexual man. I want to be a cis male. I want an actual male XY chromosome body, and a working penis and such, not a prosthetic. Obviously this is impossible, so why would I bother with a transition if it will never be what I really want? (No offence is meant to trans guys here. If what you have works for you thats great! I just don’t know what I should pursue)\n\nMy anxiety/panic attacks almost always come from weird physical sensations, and since doctors generally don’t know everything about what side effects hormone treatment/testosterone has, I would have a bad time with all the changes testosterone gives you.\n\nMy talking voice would probably never pass, but I don’t really want to change it because I do a lot of singing and love being a soprano\n\nMy chest is big and binders don’t work very well because of it.

172,2016-05-25 04:59:26,4ky1v0,8,24,"Hi all, new to reddit so please be kind.

Um, so I'm afab and have only started coming out genderqueer in the past few months. It's been kind of rough (lots of anxiety, nightmares, dysphoria, internalized transphobia, etc.) but so far my people (sister, best friend, boyfriend) have been really sweet and accepting and lovely. I found a gender-non-conforming support group in my area and am trying to make some friends volunteering with a very trans-friendly organization.

The problem is negotiating this in the context of a committed relationship with my very straight boyfriend of 2+ years. He's super sweet and wonderful in every way: financially supporting me through grad school, being great around my mental health stuff, and just being the most generous and kind person I've ever met. We're really in love, living together and planning to get engaged in the near future.

And when I first came out he was really great, saying that he loved me, offering to let me borrow his clothes, and saying that even if I didn't fit in the gender binary I fit with him :) After some conversation we (I thought) agreed that basically as long as I'm not a trans man (I'm not, I'm non-binary) we could stay together and it would be fine...

Except it's not fine? I was asking him to not call me a girl/woman so often and he was asking what I'd prefer. I suggested gender neutral stuff but also asked if he would consider using mixed gender language (calling me a girl sometimes and a boy othertimes) as that's really what I'm happiest with. And he just looked at me in this panic, said that he was really uncomfortable with it, basically begged me not to ask him to call me a boy. Which of course I said he didn't have to. He did agree to be better about using gender neutral language and seems to be happiest thinking of me as just a unique sort of being, almost beyond gender entirely.

But now I'm just feeling super sad and insecure and even more worried that he still just thinks of me as a very confused girl who likes to wear masculine clothing sometimes. I love him and know he is doing the best he can but it's still really hard to do this. 

Does anyone know if partners can get more comfortable with this over time? Or if its possible to er, shift one's gender identity into a slightly more reasonable shape (not cis, just more agender/genderless instead of the weird bigender thing I seem to have right now)? I don't want to lose this relationship but I don't know if I could go back to repressing this even if I wanted to. Any advice or encouragement would be so so helpful.

182,2016-05-27 18:47:50,4lc7io,2,6,"I'm AMAB and genderqueer.  I don't experience much body dysphoria and I never objected much to being called male pronouns (although I now prefer they/them), and although I do prefer to wear a mix of women's and men's clothing, I feel pretty comfortable in men's clothing, and wore almost only men's clothing for years because it was what I was used to.

The strongest disconnects I've experience with gender, though, have been with my sexuality.   I have a great deal of shame and negativity associated with my sexuality and I have decided that this year I want to work on breaking it down.  (Last year I ""came out"" as nonbinary in the sense of being more open about my identity and also changing how I dress and present much of the time, to bring my appearance more into harmony with my identity.)

Sexuality-wise, I'm mostly attracted to women, and have only dated women and one female-presenting nonbinary AMAB person.  But I feel like my sexuality is super different from that of a typical straight male.  I have a certain affinity with lesbian culture and identity.  People sometimes mistake me for a lesbian when I talk about my relationships online, and I often find more appeal in how lesbians talk about women than how men do.

I feel a strong desire for symmetry and equality in romantic and sexual relationships, and I'd ideally like my relationships to be as free from gender norms as possible.  But because I'm AMAB and don't want to hide that or change my body, I am perceived and treated as male by most people.  Sexuality seems strongly gendered in our society, and I often feel forced into roles and constrained by constraints that cause me great discomfort.  These include:

* The expectation or norm for men to initiate sexual or romantic relationships or interactions most of the time.  I find that if I relax and engage with people in a way that feels most natural to me, it usually leads to me having very few or no romantic or sexual connections most of the time.  This causes me a lot of discomfort, because having sexual and romantic relationships is important to me, and thus I feel forced by this situation, into playing more of the role of active pursuer or initiator than feels comfortable or right for me: I'd ideally like for things to be highly mutual / balanced or only slightly different one way or the other.  I'd like for women to pursue me / initiate things with me maybe at least a third of the time, especially when it comes to things like initiating get-togethers, initiating conversations, or pushing conversations or relationships to a deeper level of intimacy.  I start feeling profoundly uncomfortable when I'm always the one to push the relationships to the next level, yet I find that because of gender roles and socialization, I often *need* to do this or my relationships don't ever develop in the directions that I want.
* Living in a cultural framework for men expressing attraction to women, that doesn't work for me or feel comfortable to me.  People have told me that the language I use to talk about women seems pretty disjoint from the language most men use to express attraction.  For example I almost never use the terms ""sexy"" or ""hot"" and when I do it is usually to refer to something intellectual that someone did.  (Like if I see someone that I find attractive, browsing the stacks in the library in a section that I find interesting, I might describe that as ""hot"".)  If I find someone really attractive I'll usually describe them as ""cute"", ""super cute"", or ""adorable"".  Women routinely have not noticed that I was interested in / attracted to them until I was extremely direct or explicit about it, and then have expressed great surprise...but conversely I've also had women numerous times think I was interested in them when I'm not.  I think of myself as a fairly open and direct communicator and I think there are some deeper reasons for this disconnect.  Another thing, women frequently tell me that they initially thought I was gay because of my mannerisms and ways of interacting with women.
* Being perceived as a predator or threat, and having women perceive or respond to my expressions of interest in them as if it were an imposition on them.  This is especially a huge insecurity for me because I tend to be attracted mostly to women who are significantly younger than me (i'm 35 and my last long-term relationship was with someone 8 years younger, which is an age difference I felt very comfy with, but it makes me cautious with new people because of the tendency to perceive older men as predators).  I also find this really frustrating because for me, I experience attraction primarily as like, a sense of appreciation and admiration of a person, like I find the person's presence comforting and I want to be around them more, enjoy being around them more, and I find myself caring about them more, and I care hugely about respecting boundaries.  I've found though that women's expressions of boundaries can involve poor, ambiguous, or absent communication.  I also used to struggle a lot with social awkwardness (especially when I was younger I would sometimes come across as someone on the autism spectrum, although I always test as not being on that spectrum) and used to have a lot of trouble reading people (and still have a lot of trouble when I'm nervous and/or depressed), which may factor into this too.  I've had numerous experiences where women have criticized me or reacted in ways that seemed extreme, in response to me expressing interest in them in ways that I all of my female friends have agreed to be perfectly respectful.  I think most straight guys seem to shrug off these experiences easily, but I feel very sensitive and I've unfortunately let them get to me and contribute to me feeling super ashamed of my sexuality.  I'm not always sure how to respond to or process situations when this happens.
* Sometimes I wonder if there is a disconnect between how I respond to women's appearance and how they want men to.  For example, I find high heels and bold makeup to be a strong turnoff, but the cultural consensus seems to be that this is associated with women having sex appeal.  I feel really attracted to women who aren't visibly wearing makeup and who are dressed in very comfortable clothing.  Like when I think of the times I've found women most attractive, they've often been wearing pajamas, gym clothing, or very simple casual clothing.  It's really common that when I've given women compliments on their appearance they've responded by surprise telling me that I complimented them when they felt like they were looking at their worst / frumpiest.  I notice that when a lot of women put more care into their appearance I start feeling less comfortable around them and less attracted to them and I think this may relate to my desire for symmetry--I don't want to have a partner that puts a lot more effort into their appearance than I do, because I want us to have symmetry in how we think / feel about each other's appearance and bodies, if that makes sense?  I feel like this seems to cut me off from a lot of women though...I don't know.  And often when I've opened up about these things when dating people it's come across poorly, like I'm trying to police or control the other person's appearance, which is not what I want...but at the same time it is a constraint that strongly influences my attraction to another person, and it relates to the dynamic in a relationship that I want to have, and I'm not sure how to navigate it.

So I think all of these things contribute to me spending most of my time sort of floundering around when it comes to sex and romance.

I have like, a very rich social life.  I am very outgoing and make friends very easily, I have numerous close relationships.  I have several friends that I feel strongly attracted to and many more friends that I feel moderately attracted to.

But I feel really uncomfortable navigating the romantic or sexual aspects of a relationship, especially in the early stages.  (Once I'm dating someone a lot of these issues fade away.)  I feel like all the burden is usually placed on me to push relationships in this direction, but I don't know how to do that gracefully and in a way that feels comfortable and right to me.  I find that I sink into feeling very insecure very easily...I find that my intuition is often way off...I'm sort of starting to get a sense for why this might be.  But I also don't really know how to proceed.

I'd be really grateful for any insights or ideas or suggestions that anyone has!  I'd love to talk in more depth too, if anyone wants to ask any questions to clarify any of this too.

For example, I find high heels and bold makeup to be a strong turnoff, but the cultural consensus seems to be that this is associated with women having sex appeal.  I feel really attracted to women who aren\'t visibly wearing makeup and who are dressed in very comfortable clothing.  Like when I think of the times I\'ve found women most attractive, they\'ve often been wearing pajamas, gym clothing, or very simple casual clothing.  It\'s really common that when I\'ve given women compliments on their appearance they\'ve responded by surprise telling me that I complimented them when they felt like they were looking at their worst / frumpiest.  I notice that when a lot of women put more care into their appearance I start feeling less comfortable around them and less attracted to them and I think this may relate to my desire for symmetry--I don\'t want to have a partner that puts a lot more effort into their appearance than I do, because I want us to have symmetry in how we think / feel about each other\'s appearance and bodies, if that makes sense?  I feel like this seems to cut me off from a lot of women though...I don\'t know.  And often when I\'ve opened up about these things when dating people it\'s come across poorly, like I\'m trying to police or control the other person\'s appearance, which is not what I want...but at the same time it is a constraint that strongly influences my attraction to another person, and it relates to the dynamic in a relationship that I want to have, and I\'m not sure how to navigate it.\n\nSo I think all of these things contribute to me spending most of my time sort of floundering around when it comes to sex and romance.\n\nI have like, a very rich social life.  I am very outgoing and make friends very easily, I have numerous close relationships.  I have several friends that I feel strongly attracted to and many more friends that I feel moderately attracted to.\n\nBut I feel really uncomfortable navigating the romantic or sexual aspects of a relationship, especially in the early stages.  (Once I\'m dating someone a lot of these issues fade away.)  I feel like all the burden is usually placed on me to push relationships in this direction, but I don\'t know how to do that gracefully and in a way that feels comfortable and right to me.  I find that I sink into feeling very insecure very easily...I find that my intuition is often way off...I\'m sort of starting to get a sense for why this might be.  But I also don\'t really know how to proceed.\n\nI\'d be really grateful for any insights or ideas or suggestions that anyone has!  I\'d love to talk in more depth too, if anyone wants to ask any questions to clarify any of this too.\n\nThanks in advance!', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Dealing With Disconnects About Sexuality: Not Sure How To Proceed', 'created': 1464400070.0}"

I'm AFAB and my discomfort with that manifested itself in a lot of harmful ways- internalized misogyny, profound awkwardness and low self esteem, self destructive behavior, all of that. I was not an introspective person until my early 20's, at which point I began to practice cognitive behavioral therapy, and I found a medication that helps me with my anxiety. I also cut a lot of toxic people from my life and began to work towards improving myself as a person and learning to be happy.

I'm far from perfect these days, but I've come a long way. A lot of my well-being now was fought for through some of the worst circumstances one could imagine- I hit bottom a lot. But through it all, I unlearned a lot of awful cognitive distortions and really harmful ideas about a lot of things that were causing me so much anguish. I learned to speak my mind, and to listen to others. I even began to embrace the female body I live in, while also embracing my long-closeted desire to be androgynous, queer, and to love people outside of the binary. 

However, there's something that's been nagging me a lot, and it's raised a lot of questions. Throughout my life, I've felt that my body was wrong. That on the inside, I feel very male. A gentle, androgynous, non-binary male, but a male nontheless. I've learned to not hate the body I live in, with its curves and softness, and appreciate it for what I like about it. I don't hate it anymore. But it still feels so wrong. 

I used to think my dysphoria was how I expressed my low self-esteem: a safe fantasy, perhaps. But now, even as I can objectively appreciate myself, it just feels so at odds with how I see myself. I don't cringe or shy away from my reflection anymore. I don't struggle with social anxiety like I used to, I speak my thoughts and I don't try to be anyone I'm not. But I still look at myself and on a visceral level, I don't really see myself. 

In big and small ways, I've begun to explore what I call ""my boy self"". Since earlier forays into masculinity ended up being uncomfortable due to me mostly trying to be a stereotype of maleness, this time I've refused to let myself fall into traps of what I should and shouldn't do- if I'm already a genderqueer female, why would my male self be any different? I finally was able to purchase a binder and it's been *incredible*. My haircuts and outfits are decidedly non-gendered, and the only way I act these days is how I feel. But the more I play with this, the stronger my dysphoria has become. I find myself admiring how I look (hooray!) but also wishing that my jaw was more pronounced, that I was more angular, my voice was deeper, that under the same clothes I could be a male.

I have a gender neutral name from birth (thanks, parents!) and some of my friends have already begun to use gender neutral pronouns. Amusingly enough, I didn't ask any of them to do this- they just said as I began to present more androgynously, it seemed much more natural for them.

I don't really know where I'm going with this- this is just my thoughts and my experience, and I'm wondering if there are other GQ people who have similar stories. I'm not in any rush exactly, I'm still exploring myself, but the further I go, the more I feel like HRT might be in my future.

To start off, I am not trans as in I don't want to change my body or or become a women in any way.  I like my penis and I like my body and my voice.  Makeup, dresses, etc ie the things considered classically feminine I dislike and don't want. I hate the term male though. 

Like its this stupid thing that really leaves me feeling hollow at times but really .  I wake up some days and look in the mirror and am like yep that is a male and I feel male and I walk around and I am really happy with that.  

But then I like the she pronoun at times and I look across the table at this cute girl I see and am like ""she"" that has a nice oddball ring to it.  And I love my little pony for instance.  It's about as girly as you could get and I can't stop but just love the pink and rainbow ponies.  But I also don't really ever see myself wanting to ask people to use she ever or present as female.  I never want to present super feminine and try my best to not to have feminine mannerisms.  It's just something I actually know I don't want.

Like male is something I know I identify with in some level but on some other level certain female things also resonate. I'm really confused and nervous.

I've considered that it's probable I am gender queer in some fashion.  The trans label doesn't fit, the genderfluid/agender label might fit.  I don't want to present any differently though.  I also don't want to use other pronouns as of now. I don't know if you could put an accurate label on it.  Perhaps is some greyish gender label I've never heard of.  I don't know.

I don't know how to feel or what to do really.  I went from this pretty straight forward everyday straight guy and started exploring myself and ignoring what society told me and I feel like a fucked up human being. Nothing about me seems like a concrete straight forward I am x.

I ain't questioning whether I want this surgery or if it's right for me; it's all I've ever wanted for as long as I can remember. I thought that determination would help me feel more confident when the time came, but nope... I don't have any friends and really wish I had built a support network before going into this; I'd give anything to have someone to talk to that knew how to calm me down about now. But oh well, no turning back now.

Wish me luck?  Maybe I'll update after the surgery once the pain meds wear off. Or maybe during, if you see any posts along the lines of 'dude I'm being sucked into the skyyy'.

Edit: here's my time line so far.


Bed and Breakfast:
Dr. Brassard has you arrive around two days before your surgery at the Gite du Marigot bed and breakfast. I guess this is a buffer period to make scheduling easier while dealing with flight delays. Since I drove in though and was close enough I kind of wished I would have had the option to just drive in the day of surgery since I just stewed in my anxiety the whole time. But to its credit the Gite was super comfy and the food was really delicious. (I'm a culinary arts major so if I say food is good, it's *good*). There's lots of sitting areas and antique furniture,  balcony, and a beautiful backyard patio with a pond. Eating is communal. You all get called down to eat together at specific times. I was kind of a socially anxious wreck so I didn't say much but I made friends with one of the trans girls. She's insanely pretty and nice. I guess I'll call her D for anonymity. We sat together and talked a lot out back and have been texting back and forth since she had surgery the day I leave the hospital.


DAY -2: Did nothing but stewed in my own anxiety all day... stomach and head were both giving me a lot of trouble.


DAY -1: all you have to do this day is take two fleet enemas, shower and shave your surgical site.  The enemas were nowhere near as bad as I expected them to be, they're super lubed so they slide in like nothing and the pressure to... evacuate is very clear without being so urgent that you're worried about cropping yourself. Slept a bit better tonight since they relieved my stomach aches and since I didn't sleep at all the first night.


SURGERY DAY:
First I want to say that this was at the Duval, not the normal surgery centre. Apparently a month ago an ex patient came in with an axe and set fire to the facility beside the recovery Centre. Everyone has been surprisingly nice about it saying they hope she gets the help she needs and stuff like that, but jeezes. I'm going to go the politcally incorrect route and say she sounds like a damn psycho. Sick or not there are always immobile trans patients there, possibly out or in surgery. Whatever her issues were there was no reason to risk killing a bunch of people, your people... Euch,  anyways, some of the nurses at the Duval aren't that knowledgeable about trans folks. So my experience may be different from what's typical. They were all super polite and kind, just a little out of their element dealing with the aftercare of a surgery they didn't know?


Day 1 of surgery - a cab picked me up outside the Gite.  The cabbie didn't speak English,  only French.  I can speak a little French but thankfully he was already informed where to go. Checking in and waiting in bed for the surgery is really scary, all you can do is look at the clock and panic. One nurse asked me if I'd donate my testicles and 8 vials of blood toward finding a cure for HIV. You get compensated $20 per testicle. I opted for that, then got changed into my hospital gown. I think I was shivering the rest of my stay in that, the hospital is as cold as $20 balls.


Dr. Brassard met me before the surgery. He was surprisingly very funny, that helped ease the tension. And he's super handsome.  I'm mostly into girls, but he's soap-opera-doctor dreamy. Anyhow,  you get wheeled outside the surgery room into a foyer where you'll meet the anesthesiologist.  He asks you a few questions then will wheel you into the surgery room.  There's a lot of terrifying machines and stuff all around but they'll immediately put you under. I was thankful of that because between the terror and cold I was shaking like crazy. I didn't wake up until it was over. They ask you a few questions and check how much you can feel. You should be 100% numb from the waist down. You'll have so much bandages and dressing on that you won't even be able to see your vagina yet and not for awhile. They give you a couple ice packs to keep on your pelvis to reduce swelling. And you have a catheter in... oh the catheter......


The next few hours in your room the nurses check on you every little bit to see how much feeling and sensation of temperature you've regained, how far down your legs you can feel and move again. Once you can feel in your toes the pain is about to begin and they'll give you a pain killer. My first catheter was changed and seemed to have only blood in it. I felt a burning pain down there which I thought was from the surgery so I asked for pain meds and tried to sleep. I woke up around 8pm and the pain was still there, much worse. I felt like I needed to pee so badly and didn't know what to do. The nurse said not to force it and gave me another pain killer. It didn't do anything, the feeling to pee kept getting stronger and stronger  It felt like I was about to literally rip apart on the inside. It was by far the most painful thing I ever felt, and reduced me to tears. They finally noticed around 10 that my catheter had no urine in it, just bloody discharge. They didn't know what to do and readjusting the catheter didn't work. They had to call Dr Brassard and he came in to fix me. How, I don't know, they had given me another med that almost totally knocked me out and everything's hazy from that point on. The next morning Dr. Brassard told me that my urethra swelled so much that it sealed shut before the catheters entrance.i don't know whether he fixed it surgically or some other way but it works fine after that night. It was so scary though. I cried and felt more pain than ever before that night. The nurses were so nice and stayed with me as much as they could but they hadn't ever seen that before so they didn't know what to do. It was a long wait of being in agony, from about 8 to 11:30.


Day 2 after surgery:
So much less eventful. I got graduated to solid foods today... I didn't eat much though because of my stomach hating me during stress, and they kept sending me stuff with dairy even though I'm lactose intolerant and even had a bracelet from the intake saying that? There was some (prepackaged) toast, a salty broth, and bowl of spaghetti, that'd all I remember eating. I got up and walking four times that day with the nurses' help. The third time I suddenly got really dizzy and threw up all that spaghetti... I'm not sure if that was just dizziness from blood pressure or if there was cheese in the sauce... the next meal I noticed had my room number on it and I seemed to get a dairy free meal of an egg salad wrap and a salad. It looked really nice but I didn't want to eat because I felt so queasy.


Day 3 - Today we (me and three trans women who were operated on the same day) were transfered to the recovery facility. Meanwhile D and the next batch of surgeru patients got brought to thr hospital. I was able to get out of bed alone and walk around in the morning at the hospital which felt fantastic. But then I was promptly put into a wheelchair and we had to take a wheel trans bus to the recovery Centre.  Laying down and walking are both nothing. Sitting on the other hand is pure agony. Normally the recovery Centre is right beside the hospital the surgery is done at but since we were at the Duval we had quite a drive. Every bump in the road and the bridges hurt like crazy. Once we were there we were shown around and given our rooms. I got a single room that was very nice. There's about 11 patients here right now. All trans women I believe, except for me and one trans guy (because he needs to spread his legs apart while sitting he gets a lazy boy recliner at dinner. Everyone said that is the 'throne' and that he is the 'king'!)


The recovery Centre has lots of sitting places,  a patio and park across the street which leads straight to the water. It's beautiful. Wifi is spotty... Eating is communal again and this time it's more of a buffet  (build your own plate) style meal. There's been chicken , pork chops,  rice,  soup, roasted potatoes,  broccoli, and salad so far. It was really yummy. There's even an all-hours coffee, toast, cereal, cookie, and Nutella(!) station if you get hungry at off hours. They even got me a carton of lactose free milk :') so I finally got some calcium and my shaking and anxiety calmed a little. I walked around outside for a few hours, mostly practicing walking up stairs. Still need to walk like a cowboy to prevent pain but it was alright! I may have pushed myself a bit too far though, when my dressing was changed, I had a bit of leakage out the side of the catheter and had to start using a massive pad that covers most of my pelvis and rectum. It's not comfortable at all... the nurse said it it gets worse I need to use a diaper. Because this hasn't been humiliating enough already. ._.


At dinner the nurse offered me pain meds and I said I wasn't in pain and didn't need them. That was a mistake.... I retired to my room and went to sleep.


Day 4 - woke up at 2 am in a lot of discomfort. Where my legs joined my pelvis were both hurting and no position felt comfortable. I figured i could last until morning and didnt want to call the nurse. I thought I'd tough it out and try to sleep more but couldn't for about 90 minutes.  Then I briefly slept and awoke to several nightmares in a row. The pain was getting worse.. and suddenly around 5 I needed to have my first bowel movement. That went okay  (we were given stool softeners and prune juice to facilitate it, and apparently mine is pretty early since it usually happens day 5 for most.) But the trouble was sitting down to do it. Sitting down on a low toilet while I was already in pain made me feel like I was going to rip apart. I was sure I ripped open my stitches or something from how much it hurt. I managed to get it done though then immediately went back to my room and called the nurse because of the pain. She came in and gave me two oxys. Waiting for them to kick in now while typing this. Phew. Going to try to sleep again now...

Tl;Dr take the damn pain killers even if you feel okay while recovering, you don't know where you'll be in a couple hours.

----------

Update 2: rest of that day was mostly uneventful and relatively positive and easy, ate, rested,  went for a couple walks.

DAY 5 - Hoo boy, another day with a complication... today was the day our batch of patients got their surgery dressing removed and the next batch of patients arrived at the recovery Centre. I remember waking up and the dressing felt almost like steel wool shoved down your underwear. It was soon dry and stiff and scratchy compared to previous days.   The others in my batch had their dressing removals go fine... but when they removed mine, I started gushing blood like crazy. They had to hold the Stent in my really hard and hold me shut in an attempt to let it clot. It hurt a little but not terribly, it was more scary than anything. I turned three blue bed lining pads pure red and near the end they kept taking my blood pressure and pulse every few minutes. So scary.
After 1 and half hours of holding me shut with periodic checking to see if the bleeding was stopping and realizing it wasn't they had to call Dr Brassard again.... It would have been easier if the hospital next to the asclepade was still open but since Brassard was at the Duval he had to drive there. He had to restitch me back up and this time I was awake for all of it. It again wasn't really painful at all thankfully, just really really scary. Feeling so self conscious and terrified over all these complications I'm having. I was suppose to get my first shower and learn sitz baths today but that got pushed back so the stitches can heal. I couldn't stop shaking or feeling like my head was going to explode from the nerves and stress of it all... walking was back to being hard again when I just had gotten use to it. I don't know how the next day will go... I'm suppose to get the Stent removed, learn and start dilating and douching.i guess I'll need to learn sitz baths and have my first shower too... I kind of hope they push something back because that's so much to learn and do all in one day... My friend got in on today's batch of patients. She said she threw up six times a day at the Duval!  I had heard another girl throwing up all night long too. I didn't have much nausea at all thankfully but I guess it affects everyone differently. 

DAY 6 - typing this update this morning so nothing to say yet. Another girl still throwing up lots. It feels super swollen around my Stent.. it's really noticeably jabbing into me now so maybe they will remove it today after all.  Scared of more complications... the dilators also look a little scary. We're supposed to dilate 4x, douche 2x, sitz baths 2x, and shower 1x a day right now. Dilations are really 25 minutes each and use three different dilators labeled 2, 3, and 4. I don't know what happened to #1. :p 2 looks reasonable.  3 is ""whew lad"". 4 is a ""oh my god how much did you pay for that cucumber I'm not a female horse!!!"" sized.... thankfully we don't need to use that scary one until month 2....",genderqueer,surgery tomorrow (brassard).

I ain\'t questioning whether I want this surgery or if it\'s right for me; it\'s all I\'ve ever wanted for as long as I can remember. I thought that determination would help me feel more confident when the time came, but nope... I don\'t have any friends and really wish I had built a support network before going into this; I\'d give anything to have someone to talk to that knew how to calm me down about now.

I guess this is a buffer period to make scheduling easier while dealing with flight delays. Since I drove in though and was close enough I kind of wished I would have had the option to just drive in the day of surgery since I just stewed in my anxiety the whole time. But to its credit the Gite was super comfy and the food was really delicious. (I\'m a culinary arts major so if I say food is good, it\'s *good*). There\'s lots of sitting areas and antique furniture,  balcony, and a beautiful backyard patio with a pond. Eating is communal. You all get called down to eat together at specific times.

I might wear more feminine cut jeans out, but given the more conservative leaning area I'm in, I might not feel as comfortable presenting in a way I saw a person do today (despite desires to). I will be using the ""they"" pronoun to describe them because, quite frankly, I don't know how to describe them beyond that.

Face and hairstyle looked like a more average, slightly more masculine Tyler Oakley look. If Tyler had more average skin, I'd expect him to not look too far from how this person looked. Hairstyle was the buzzed sides long top look, blonde.

This person also had on a dark colored, kinda heathered gray, top that didn't scream feminine, but kinda whispered it to me. Person didn't appear to have any ""development"" up top, so that, with the face, leans me more to assume AMAB person.

The shorts this person had on, and their legs, is where presentation shifted fully feminine. Their legs appeared to be shaved or waxed, and they had on shorts that were definitely feminine, kinda contemporary Daisy Dukes in coverage and rise, but not cut-off style.

206,2016-05-31 10:50:26,4lumuw,6,17,"Hi all!


I’ve been struggling a bit lately to reconcile my gender identity with how I am in bed with apartner. I am currently seeing a lovely girl (cis) who has been super supportive of me and my
identity/expression. I’m genderqueer with a feminine leaning I’d say. I’m also AFAB. She’sasked me what gendered words I like in bed and always checks in with me during things and isjust super kind and lovely. We’re both kinky, so I feel the conversation of gender has come up quicker.


It’s also made me realize the extent the gender is pervasive when it comes to having sex,
obviously when it comes to vanilla sex, but especially when it comes to kink. That’s not to say
that kink is emphasizing or enforcing these norms, I just think that in vanilla sex they can bemore downplayed and subversive. I personally don’t think that gender should be necessary, butit doesn’t take long to realize that gender is actually a major thread or basis in many kinks, even
some of my own.

Anyway, I’d say with my partner we split about 60/40 when it comes to dominance or leading inbed. We’re both Capricorns and she likes to talk about how I’m the only person that has ever
out­-Capricorned her, which I find super cute because she gets really flustered and keeps telling
me that one day she’ll get the true upper hand on me, but hasn’t yet and it definitely does some
injury to her Capricorn pride, in a not actually serious way though. She does really enjoy mebeing in charge.

I don’t necessarily see myself consistently as the dominant partner. Really I just like giving andpleasing her and sometimes demand or insist (with her permission and consent of course) thatshe get that however she needs it. And I love doing it!

The one hang up I’ve been having recently, especially considering that I only came out as
genderqueer in the past few months, is that when I’m in a dominant role, I often get this feelingthat I am performing a man’s role. Now I do have a pretty androgynous presentation, but I haveabsolutely NO affinity for nor want to be a man. So this becomes a problem for me because Ifeel like heteronormativity just won't get it’s busted ass out of my sex life, where it very muchdoes not belong. It’s just frustrating to realize how deeply rooted these ideas can be within us,even when we don’t fit the model for the heterosexual patriarchy.

2,2016-05-01 17:49:17,4haauf,8,9,"Hello everyone.  I've very recently discovered the term ""genderfluid"" and realized that I identify strongly with what I've discovered.  

I was AMAB, and, while  I didn't know or understand it until more recently, experienced feminine feelings growing up.  I quickly learned that ""boys don't do that"" and ""boys don't wear that"", and set about working to be a good boy - wanting to fit in and not wanting to attract attention.

Around college, I began experimenting with feminine clothing, much to my fiancé's chagrin.  She wasn't happy about it, so I set it aside - men don't do that, and I'm a man. Inevitably, the need to dress up returned, so I began doing it stealthily (at least, I thought I was being stealthy - my wife knew, and still didn't like it).  Fast forward to recently, and after many years of hiding and suppressing, I developed periodic bouts of depression (self-diagnosed - I was still too scared to talk to anyone else), culminating recently in full-on despair.

After breaking down and sharing **all** my thoughts and feelings with my wife (and after allowing her time to work through her own feelings about it), I'm finally working towards acknowledging and accepting this aspect of myself, and I'm blessed that my wife is supportive.  That's not to say that she likes it, but rather, she loves me, sees me hurting, and wants to help me get better.

I recently began counseling, have started journaling (the first time I've ever allowed any of these words/thoughts/feelings outside of my own head), and am beginning to carefully craft a support system.  My emotions are all over the place, as is my sense of my own gender.  At times, I feel foolish and embarrassed for feeling the way I do, and at other times, I just want to shout my feelings out as loud as I can for everyone to hear.

So this is my story so far; I just wanted to introduce myself because I'm searching for support groups (online and in-person) so I can start to feel part of a community - something I've lacked nearly my entire life.

7,2016-05-03 14:13:57,4hnfs9,1,11,"One thing that has hugely helped me to become aware of how gender is a social construct, is exposure to different cultures.  I've become aware of this both when traveling, and when participating in different subcultures in my own community.

I've noticed that specific gender norms are often highly variable culturally.  For example, where I live now in the U.S., most of the women, when they wear jeans, wear skinny jeans or other very closely-fitting jeans, and the men usually wear much baggier jeans.  Often if I'm wearing women's skinny jeans I look a little out of place, like I stand out, as an AMAB person wearing them.  But when I was in Germany, this norm goes out the window, German men often wear super tight jeans, and I even got comments about how my pants were ""so loose"" if I wore jeans more typical of what men wear here.

Another culturally variable norm I've noticed is shaving.  I shave my legs, and I sometimes have gotten comments where people ask me: ""Oh, do you swim?"" as if I need some reason for doing it.  But like in Hispanic cultures I have seen more men who shave their legs, certainly not all or most but like, it's more within the range of ""typical"" behaviors, so people don't notice it as anything deviant.

I also have noticed this with qualities of personality, communication, etc.  For example, in the culture I'm surrounded by there is a stereotype of women being more emotional and men being more stoic and less openly passionate.  But I've noticed that in the Hispanic cultures I've had exposure to, men often talk more openly about being motivated by feelings, being passionate about things, etc.

So like basically I have found that for me when I go into different cultures, my concept of my own gender changes.  I think I'm a better fit for the constructs of masculinity or femininity in some cultures than others, both in terms of aesthetics and self-expression, and in terms of social norms.

One last thing, I think I tend to think more about gender when I'm in strongly gendered cultures.  When I was at college, it was less strongly gendered of an environment, and I felt like my own gender identity became less important.  Where I live now, it feels strictly gendered and my own identity feels important because it articulates or describes a clash I feel and I way I feel ""between"" or ""outside of"" the two groups that I see most people fitting into.",genderfluid,Does your concept of gender and self-identity change in different cultures?,1462310037.0,"{'created_utc': 1462284837, 'id': '4hnfs9', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 11, 'selftext': 'One thing that has hugely helped me to become aware of how gender is a social construct, is exposure to different cultures.

21,2016-05-10 02:49:08,4in85k,11,3,"Hello! This is my first post on Reddit. I was hoping to post this in a couple-few places and maybe get some advice or ideas for this confliction I have.

I don’t really know how to start this off entirely, due to never going this in depth about it before vocally. So, some of this may be more like bullet points than fledged out wording, I’m not sure.

I guess I will start by stating that I am female bodied and I am genderneutral from what I understand. I don’t mind any pronouns and I never exactly want to cut off any of my body parts strongly one way or another or hate them for what they are on me. However, I could do away with it all if I could opt out of having them altogether no problem. The thing is here that I feel I may be happier/more comfortable as a male, even if it’s just in clothed appearance and not a 100% change. I do not know a lot of this topic of types of changes one can make, so I am open to those who want to share knowledge on all types of sex change options out there of any kind.
I have been between feeling male some days (like today) and more female the next (I never really feel 100% anything, but I do feel stronger male when I do than I do stronger female. Most days I just don’t even think about it while in the middle ground as I have been for a long while), while also being neither or both (basically not caring about it) another. I am a bit confused about it, but I feel being male in some regard for me would be the preferred confusion situation. I feel I would probably be more comfortable, at least a bit, if male in at least appearance for some part, rather than my female self as I am right now. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind girl-ing up and looking like a true princess some days (like you can see in pictures at the bottom of this post as well as my days I want to look more like a gentleman). 

So, I wouldn’t need to entirely change my facial structure to feel more secure (though I do like many looks I see on trans males who went through the change that are convincing with the thought of my own face looking such a way as well as the thought of light facial hair other days). I was once a voice actor and portray a lot of myself through different voices, even a little girl’s at times (just can come out when giddy/excited about something enough) and I don’t entirely know how I’d feel about that change. I know how to do a boy’s voice, so many that wouldn’t be entirely lost, but still. It’d be… Different in a way I’m a bit wary about, but I still want to know my male voice personally. I did over time naturally get a more neutral/deeper voice and I wonder if it was from this inner male self becoming more natural in my person to me and I don’t overly care about having a female voice (outside of said abilities with manipulating my current voice to show expression)

I want to be a girlfriend to a girlfriend, rather than a male with a girlfriend (at least for right now). I’m not 100% against the idea of being male-bodied in some regard to a girlfriend the more I think about it, but I’ve never had a girlfriend, only boyfriends. I’m 85% lesbian at least (that’s the female side of me. I am bisexual, but not a very sexual person. So being male with a boyfriend in a not very sexual relationship isn’t beyond me, really), but I like personality more than bodies or sex. I like the female body a lot more, but I also like both body’s chest types. I’m not into or like the idea of penetration sex (vaginally, anyway. Anal doesn’t bother me). Penetration is very uncomfortable for me (practically sickeningly so. Likely due to the way my body developed from a rather extreme birth situation and, past sexual abuses from males, and likely some type of attraction/orientation I haven’t gone into deep depth about outside of being bisexual) and hurts like /crazy/. I haven’t had a penis fully inside of me due to the hot knife pain. However, I do like rubbing/humping with another person. I am able to climax from that alone due to my having a vagina. So, I still want/like the idea of being a girlfriend to a girlfriend. I haven’t thought too deeply about saying I am genderneutral/half female/female some of the time while having gotten a sex change if I did. That could be enough on its own, but I do enjoy the thought of females with females for myself. The curves, body parts, voices, but I feel perhaps if I found the right partner, that could be better understood for myself with someone understanding, caring, and supportive/open to the ideas for my body.

I do want to know what my voice would sound like as male. I know you can in audio editing, but it sounds oddly robotic to me a lot of the time and I don’t often enjoy the sound, compared to a natural voice. I also don’t like having to do the whole process, compare to being able to speak it on my own. Is there a device of some kind that lets you hear an opposite gender voice of your own as you speak or something?

I feel the most comfortable at all times with really short hair. I like pigtails, but other than that I don’t like anything about having long hair. On other’s it’s more than okay, it’s just a preference for myself. I own wigs and like to collect them, so there’s no real problem there if I wanted longer or dyed hair, it’s just that storing the things are a nightmare and a half, so I have been yet able to collect anymore or better wear them.

I enjoy frilly/poofy dresses (it’s a sort of dream of mine to own a princess dress ^///^’’) and I also really would love to own a custom-made tux. I own male clothes (boxers, shirts, jackets), but I also like cute panties, knee high stockings, cute shoes, light makeup (mostly just eyeliner and lip gloss, maybe blush sometimes), the works. This is a part of it I do enjoy. I love having so many options to wear and express, however, I don’t like the nagging feeling I can get about wanting to be in another body type, wanting to know. I get a bit conflicted with the idea of the change, because I know I am just a very neutral person. I have friends who have been fully trans and very passionate about changing, certain, but I’m not as passionate. However, I still want it. I like my breasts, sort of, but I like the idea of a flat, natural male chest, as well. I used to be more attached when trying to look female, but I could take them or leave them as long as I could still manage to wear girly dresses somehow. What matters to me on those days is my face and how pretty I look to myself, rather than a guy. I am not at all attached to my vagina (kind of hate having one at all due to all its problems, but not /because/ it’s a vagina) outside of rubbing is awesome and I’d like to know what it’s like to have sex with a girl or be sexual with one a bit, at least. I also like guys that have more female like butts, so I’d probably keep mine as is. It’s kind of a cross between them, anyway. I have broader shoulders than most females (runs in the family and keeps me out of a lot of pretty clothes &gt;&lt;) and while I have curves in my middle, I have sort of flat hips. I also have semi or full abdominal obesity. All the fat my whole life just focuses on my midsection for some reason. I wouldn’t at all mind being chubby. I find chubby girls really cute and attractive, but when all of it centers in one place rather than all over and won’t go away no matter what I do… It’s bothersome as all hell to my confidence. I can’t get myself to wear most tight dresses or bathing suits. Since it won’t leave, I also am considering surgery for fat reduction, as well.

I once questioned if I was trans, which I still sometimes wonder on some level, and that I really like the idea of being a male that cross dresses. Be it in a female body or not. However, I do mind at least a bit not being seen outwardly as a crossdressing male when doing so. It’s a bit depressing.

Here’s an issue I have with the change… I have fear of surgery due to needles (like being put under, shots, bloodwork, but I could try my best to get past the phobia). However, I have mental, neurological, and physical ailments. We have yet to understand why, but as time as gone on, I have become unable to take most pills. I was happily taking them, but one day when I was taking them, I couldn’t swallow them. They weren’t horse pills, either (I wouldn’t have been able to take those even at that time). As long as the pill was in my mouth, no matter how much or how little the water, tilt of my body or head, distraction of some kind, I couldn’t make myself swallow. It was scary as hell. This went on for a short while before the ability returned suddenly. It was there for a bit before it vanished randomly again. Each time it left, the time it was gone got longer and longer, as the time I could got shorter and shorter. I think it’s gone on for more than a year now since I’ve been really solidly able to take average sized pills, so it seems now it may be permanent. When I’d get a bigger pill down (bigger than birth control or the smallest Clonidine pill ((Tic disorder/sleep medicine that also is known to lower blood pressure, but that’s not an issue I have as of yet)) ) by some miracle, I’d very often choke and gag on it, over time creating an anxiety about it due to the horrible feeling and an already existing, deep phobia of vomiting. So, now it’s harder than ever. It’s like it was developmental and my throat became tighter in the passage way, as I used to get Advil sized pills down just fine, but now it can take a while even with pills smaller than the area of your fingertip. I also have a strong gag reflex, so that doesn’t help anything on top of the rest. So, would there be some way to lower my voice pitch or anything like that without pills?... Maybe some type of dissolving tablet or very small, very small pill? Even Wellbutrin pills are too big at this point. Also, if post or pre-surgery takes pills… I dunno how that would go. I really want this a lot of the time or at least the option, so I don’t want my health to take /another/ thing away from me, like it has most else. Even if it just made my voice more between a male and female, rather than just my tone/default style of speaking.

Does anyone have any suggestions or responses or experiences/relations to anything I’ve said? Most all is welcome. I wouldn’t 100% need my facial structure to overall change, due to having a semi-neutral look already when I make myself look male. I once was able to really well, but I think my face was a bit less chubby back then. Perhaps at my 20/21 age now I look more feminine (while not extremely so), rather than 18/19 years old face. However, this could be false and I just haven’t made myself up pretty or more masculine in a long while. Just haven’t had the motivation to, but I am starting to get it again. Unlike most I’ve known, I don’t care as deeply to my core as they do, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want the change in some form, genderneutral or not. I find it more comfortable and even rather exciting/feels like forward motion in my life. I just sort of know next to nothing and have some significant disadvantages to going about it.

Here are some pictures of me in both of my looks. Please reply with ideas, suggestions, questions, comments, and such bellow to this post? I really want to communicate about this, but I don’t really know how to go about any of these wants or conflictions just yet.
Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and or reply! It really means a lot to me, as I’ve never gone this in depth about it before.

I am a bit confused by how to post pictures with text posts to Reddit, so I'll just include a link to the gallery. Let me know if there are any problems with that!

Unlike most I’ve known, I don’t care as deeply to my core as they do, but that doesn’t mean I don’t want the change in some form, genderneutral or not. I find it more comfortable and even rather exciting/feels like forward motion in my life. I just sort of know next to nothing and have some significant disadvantages to going about it.\n\nHere are some pictures of me in both of my looks. Please reply with ideas, suggestions, questions, comments, and such bellow to this post? I really want to communicate about this, but I don’t really know how to go about any of these wants or conflictions just yet.\nThank you very much for taking the time to read this and or reply! It really means a lot to me, as I’ve never gone this in depth about it before.\n\nI am a bit confused by how to post pictures with text posts to Reddit, so I'll just include a link to the gallery.

I just wanted to share something that happened today that was probably completely inconsequential, maybe accidental, and totally made my day.


So for as long as I can remember ive been at odds with what I am supposed to be. Amab, but the mind never always agreed.

For months I would be completely confident with my tall broad beardy self wearing great suits and well fitted shirts that emphasised the godgiven muscle genes they blessed me with. 

And then for months after that, not at all happy about it. The mind never matched the mirror, they were too hairy, couldn't wear beautiful dresses outside, was ashamed of the figure that lacked the curves it really yearned for.

The last few months have been, what i think to be the beginning of an acceptance though. I can at least affirm to myself now that I am ok being what I need to be. I paint my nails because it makes me happy and I wear the nicest female pants around the house (which is shared with friends [the house, not the pants]). I am becoming content with both of me. I accept my femme moods and their emergent actions and as i do each half draws closer to a whole. This makes me happy and a lot less stressed.


But I digress, what really made my day recently, was at work, neatly set into my societally accepted role. 

I had to contact a service centre to organise some repair works, by phone I have a reasonably neutrally set voice, and am blessed with an ambiguous name. So after what seemed like an hour confirming service and warranty details, passing on troubleshooting steps taken etc, I recieve approval for the repair work to take place. 

Followed by an email, and I really got a kick out of how it began.

27,2016-05-11 17:30:21,4iw212,2,3,"Hey :) (btw. I'm 19 and born female)

So a few weeks ago I was in the living room and I thought about my gender. I thought I might be FtM but I'm also okay with being female.

I guess I best described it when I was 11. I told me best friend several times that ""I wish I would've been born as a boy"". Which doesn't mean that I'd change my sex or body in any way to be male, but it doesn't mean that I feel good about being female either.

So I thought about just identifying as ""female"". I'm not a girl nor a woman nor will I ever be a women. But I'm also not male. I'm ""female""

anyway. When I stood in the living room, looking at myself I started to think this:

**I just thought to myself: ""What do you see when you look into the mirror? Boy or girl?""

so I looked into the reflection of me in the window, the night outside made my picture clear, but: ""neither. Or Both?""

I looked some more: ""I got long hair, like a girls. Not too long but not as short as a guy would wear. I'm overweight, I got big breasts and a toned figure. My face, not so feminine, I guess. Not masculin either. My expression. Like a criminal, but that's normal for me. It came with the (almost)never-smiling years of my childhood. The childhood I spend playing with pink and blue. Just like I spend my teenage years - pink and blue. More blue? Maybe I tried to hard with the blue. But what for? I liked the pink. I guess. I just didn't like to talk about it as pink. I talked about it as a hobby, as a thing grown men do as well. Just not everday men, maybe. But some.""

""so I needed excuses? for myself? for others? for what or whom? What's wrong with the pink? That it made me feel bad about myself. Who thought that maybe pink is stronger than blue? Maybe it is. Maybe I'm just pathetic.""

""There it is again: Pathetic because of pink? There I feel it again how it tears me down, everything but my shell which I can't figure out.""**

hope it's not too confusing :P

I actually have a question though: what would you think could be a term I could identify as?

I've never dressed up as a guy (but I will as soon as I live alone and learn to lower my voice)

but I'm defenitly curious if it would fit me and if I'd feel better being called male pronounces and so on.

I always liked it when someone else on the internet thought I was male, but maybe it's different from the real world? I don't know. I don't have friends with whom I could talk about this. I could talk to my parents about this and they probably wouldn't have a problem, but I'm not ready

30,2016-05-13 12:32:09,4j63h0,3,5,"A little backstory:

I was born male but for as long as I can remember I have wish to be female. The most vivid memories of this start at around the time I was 10 or 11. However, at the time I had no idea what this was so I suppressed it. I have continued to do so for basically the last 13 years up until recently when it came to a boiling point and I discovered it was the cause of my anxiety. 

My anxiety has been getting worse and worse over the years but once I accepted this and stopped ignoring it, every sign of anxiety is gone. No panic attacks, no tingling in the arms or breathing problems any more. It's even easier to just go outside in general. I am even more confident than I was before.

Now about my confusion:

At first I was willing to accept I was just MTF and figure it out from there. But I started noticing it would change throughout the day. One moment I would have very intense gender dysphoria and wish I was a woman. A few hours later I would feel completely fine as a man and question why I had those feelings to begin with.

For me it seems to ""shift"" throughout the day, maybe because I have been suppressing it for so long. Clothes don't tend to bug me as 90% of mine are neutral anyways, always have been. 

I did try a ""test"" yesterday. I recorded every time I felt different for starters:

In the morning I felt Neutral. Then completely male for two hours. After that most of the day was female, followed by male in the late afternoon and female for the rest of the day after that.

During the times I felt Female and had normal dysphoria of my own body I could picture myself were ""girly"" clothes and it made me feel happier. During the times I felt Male, if I tried to picture myself in the same clothes I felt that same feeling of dysphoria towards that imagined version of me.

When I felt female looking in the mirror I wish I had longer hair and I was kindof annoyed by my reflection (not sure how to describe it). When I felt male I was confident in my appearance and happier.

So, as you can see I am terribly confused. I guess this is what happens when your suppress something so long.

My basic question is: Is this genderfluid? Or something else? 

When I read the definition of genderfluid and read other peoples experiences with me it felt for the first time something fit my feelings so perfectly. 

Maybe I am overthinking this as it's odd to have a label for something after so long.

Now the topic I have in mind isn't bathrooms, who is and isn't faking it, or any of the other issues that are popping up about it right now, no I want to talk about how everyone is gender fluid. Now you may be ready to make a comment damning me, but just give me a minute to explain myself. Everyone is gender fluid, to an extent I should say, everyone falls somewhere on the spectrum of gender, no matter how manly you are, you got some girly girl in you and vice versa, but it doesn't stop there, some days you may feel more dudebro and others more ladysis (couldn't think of an equivalent to dudebro so I made one up), so in essence aren't we all at least a little gender fluid? I mean, if we stop looking at the labels and crap, if we look at those words for what they are, doesn't everyone fit into the box of gender fluid? As I said let's look at those words, gender has to do mainly with behavior and to a lesser extent dress, it really came from that arbitrary need to define things, to say men fix cars and pound brews while women talk about shoes and get manicures. In reality this word doesn't matter in the slightest, people who try to say what people can and can't do based on their parts and mannerisms, people who say that if a guy goes out onto the street wearing a skirt, but still has a full beard, he's a freak, why? It doesn't make any sense, guys have been wearing skirts for centuries in more eastern cultures, and some of them have been the most manly guys out there, fucking samurai wore skirts, and those were some tough sons of bitchs. What we wear and how we act don't matter, the only reason people think they matter is because in general people who were born with the male sex are usually more masculine, and those born with the female sex are more feminine, that's obviously because of hormones, but even so, every man has some estrogen, and every woman has some testosterone, we all have both, so if you think about it, doesn't that make us fluid in our gender? Because we have both, and because us humans are walking contradictions, we can swing one way or the other on any given day, our gender, like everything else, is a river, constantly flowing, and as time goes on and erosion happens, our rivers change and take new shapes, we flow differently, so what we identify with and how we act moves with the waters. My belief in this actually has some very simple reasoning, I believe that we should judge based on content of character over your gender, or sex, or race, or nationality, or anything, at the end of the day we're all people, and we don't need the boxes and labels, you should deside to like or dislike someone based on if they're an asshole or not. Does that person steal candy from a little kid? Do they try to be there for people who need a little help, be it some spare cash to fill up their car, or just a caring ear to vent out the bullshit they have to deal with at work? Is that person the type to rob a bank, and if they are, will they shoot the little girl who's scared and crying? These are the questions to ask folks, not are you gender X or do you fuck gender X? I've seen to many people say that this person isn't trans or gender fluid enough, or, they're faking it for attention, stop it people, you need to realize that most folk are trying to get by and be happy just like you, so stop trying to put them into a box or try to shit on them because of something that has no relevance to them being a good or bad person.
