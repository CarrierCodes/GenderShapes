9,2016-11-16 01:16:29,5d6exz,11,4,"Hi there. Fit, athletic(ish), non-binary on HRT, trying to keep my appearance male but with aspects of female. A foot in both camps, so to speak. 

Why am I here? Well, I'm hoping that someone can offer some practical and emotional advice regarding my relationship, which has been going amazingly well up till now -- we've hit a rocky shore.

My relationship with cis female has been awesomely amazing, we are really close. However, while I thought I was heading towards full transition, we both knew that the relationship would end, because that's not what she wanted. 

But, lo! After a lifetime of being in the closet, then 5-years of agonising over my identity, I discovered that I did not want to transition fully and finally felt really good about myself. Yay me! 

Anyway, my discovery was eventually revealed to my partner in a long heartfelt discussion, the both of us breathing sighs of relief that our relationship was intact. As it turned out, some level of transition is fine. 

Fast forward another couple of months and I get the chilling, emotion-laden ""We need to talk"". I was told that I have continued to develop physical, emotional and behavioural changes to a more female level, which, for my partner, crossed the line. Personally, I don't think the changes have been huge, so that's a little scary for me, because if it's that fine a line I'm not sure I can contain my development within such a narrow window. Then again, it's probable that both of our observational perspectives are skewed: she seeing more changes based on her knowledge of my being on HRT (I'm yet to be clocked as anything other than male), while I am likely a little oblivious to day-to-day changes and not seeing overall continued development. 

The upshot of these developments is that my partner has lost some sexual attraction to me, where she says that it's not the same as before, though we are still very physical in more emotional ways. This recent development is not the end, according to my partner, as we both believe our relationship to be very special and worth working on. To be honest, I was happy with my physical development when we had our first talk about this, so any additional changes are kind of arbitrary to me and am not at all against rolling back some of my meds (but how do I regulate this to keep, more or less, an equilibrium?)

However, I do have some doubts as to whether someone who has lost sexual attraction based on transition changes can ever get that attraction back. There's also the emotional toll on me being told that my partner has lost their sexual attraction to me, which I think is quite significant and makes me feel insecure in the relationship.

So, questions. 

1. What do people think of this situation generally (please ask for more info or clarification in needed)?

2. As I said, I'd like to roll back a bit of my development and try and keep as steady a physical state as is possible (is it possible?). How do people here, in your experience, maintain HRT so as not to:

(a) let testosterone levels creep back up too much or at all, as I barely have any;

(b) maintain libido (as a drop in estrogen adversely affects mine) and;

(c) keep the secondary characteristics (breasts) in check (I like them smallish, but fighting good breast genetics on both sides)?

Any help from you peeps would be absolutely awesome!

Thanks in advance :)

Oh, and for what it's worth (as YMMV), my HRT currently consists of: 

* 150 Spironolactone (daily)

* 1/4 tab of Cypro (daily)

* 75 Estradot patch

13,2016-11-18 01:02:34,5djm95,2,21,"So, I'm born female, struggled with my gender and sexual identity all my life until recently.

When I began dating the girl who I now know is my true love, she was so open and honest about her own experience with transition that it wasn't long before I tearfully admitted to her that I've always felt like my birth body didn't match up with how I wanted to be seen.

For a long time, I struggled with that big secret (""I want to be a boy""), and then- it was out. And then I realized, I had never considered what kind of boy I wanted to be, so in the safety of a few trusted friends and with my partner, I began to explore and give a voice to those long repressed feelings and desires. I began to read about non-binary trans identities and experiences, and to express myself in a way that was much more fluid and queer. I realized I always wanted to be someone whose identity was fluid, because cramming myself in a box on either side of the spectrum proved to be miserable in every way. I wanted to be androgynous. I wanted to move the slider over, so that no matter where on the spectrum I woke up, I could feel comfortable.

Finally, just last week, after months of consulting with my doctor, doing the bloodwork, and so on, he asked me if I would like to start my HRT that day. I balled up my fists and said... Yes. Why not? Let's do it. I only have one life to live, I want to start a low dose of T, and keep doing what was working so well for me- taking it a day at a time. Listening to myself. Seeking the support of community. And never trying to fit into a box again.

So far... well- psychologically the effects have been mindblowing. This last year, I've made great strides in taking care of my mental health for once, having never really done so. I stopped drinking. I'm far from better, but now I'm in a place where I don't feel like every step is a landmine. And within a day of that first injection... I felt so at peace. So unified. So calm.

The best way I've been able to describe it is this: I've always thought of this dysphoria and this deep hurt and feeling of not belonging as having two people trapped in the same body, one of which who never really got a chance to thrive. Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he's felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he's stopped throwing temper tantrums. He's even admitted that he's not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly.

But suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.

Currently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I'm not sure. I've already broken most of the ""rules"" and I've never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I'll just keep living it, day by day.

I love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn't secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I've ever had.

I won't pretend things aren't hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn't for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.

Thank you all.

Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he\'s felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he\'s stopped throwing temper tantrums. He\'s even admitted that he\'s not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly.\n\nBut suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.\n\nCurrently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I\'m not sure. I\'ve already broken most of the ""rules"" and I\'ve never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I\'ll just keep living it, day by day.\n\nI love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn\'t secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I\'ve ever had.\n\nI won\'t pretend things aren\'t hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn\'t for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.\n\nThank you all.\n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Nonbinary, gender fluid...

16,2016-11-19 00:33:31,5dpwc1,12,4,"Ok, guys. I'm desperate here and having ideations for about 4 months now. Lowest I've ever been. I am nonbinary. I have had successful relationships since high school with women. I was practically engaged just recently and we broke up because we had intimacy problems. This is the first time I have had experience with this and I'm not sure if its because I usually dated more conscious and active mates or if I have just come to a cross roads internally.  Here it goes:

She has always been gay. She is femme. She still had a bit of a princess complex which didn't help, but she constantly made me feel not masculine enough no matter how many times I would resist and say hey I am a woman too or I am very much both and enjoy being this way. She knew me when she met me, but again probably more projection during the honeymoon phase. In the late beginning we hit an issue when she told me she would like me to be even more aggressive and to hit her and choke her during sex, and for me with a history of physical and sexual abuse that was not a turn on and in fact was triggering in the moment. I had had experience giving it a try with another failed relationship, and knew myself this time. sigh. I told her that as a therapist, I can't ignore the fact that we are lacking true intimacy before I consider jumping to emotionless extremes. I already am an aggressive partner so this was confusing. I was open to her about this and we moved on but not without her constantly digging at me or cutting me down for not being a machismo fuckboi or some faux-confident gangster twat. Literally, what it felt like. She wanted me to be this unemotional object and would continue to cut down my nature, and eventually called me things like meek and soft, which I am aware that I am not. The oddest thing is I am fairly masculine and have always presented an even mix of both since childhood. I am in good shape and heck we were in love, so it was of course deeply upsetting after awhile. Eventually intimacy fell flat, I could tell her perception of me had changed. I wasn't sure if it was bc I refuse to be sadistic or its because of my abuse which I had to divulge. We talked about sex and it was a new reason each time. I have never had this intrapsychic struggle before, I've always been very comfortable letting my body be what it is. I constantly tried to initiate sex and all the different ways she requested or was expecting and she still overtly rejected me, one time she legit took her foot and pushed me away. I would leave every once in awhile for a night upset convinced she needed a different kind of partner, but she would beg and fit for me to come back. But she still tried absolutely nothing to make the situation easier or to get over the hurdle, as I tried. Zero effort, just ignored it and left me seriously confused about my self for awhile. We even went to therapy three times and the last session she came in and said she wanted someone who was more of an initiator! And yes, I was shocked and felt ambushed and responded by explaining how often I try to and she rejects me. The next day we ended it. 

Its been months and she handled it pathologically and told me that she wasn't getting wet and that I didn't tease her enough. She clearly does not know how to be vulnerable or intimate to even get to this stage. Maybe princesses live their lives constantly wet with a partner of 3 years, but I certainly didn't and told her this. 

I'm aware of her own issues here, that is not the response I'm looking for. What I am needing is some help. I feel obliterated and even asexual and not much like living. The most fucked up thing is that she dated someone who is now a FTM. I dont think its coincidental, but for me that is so against my fluid nature. Sad thing is if I was trans, I would probably take it even harder considering they truly want to present masculine... sadly sometimes toxically, which in this case they'd really not react well. I can't think of anyhting more psychologically abusive and narcissistic than to completely devastate someones sexuality. 

Has anyone had trouble in their relationships with their partners projecting faux-femininity or toxic masculinity on them? How did you survive times of deep and utter internal confusion and pain? How do you initiate as nonbinary and have you ever run into partners that got confused with your denial of roles?

Basically, after I will get my orchiectomy (which is non-negotiable due to the fact that I need it for sterilization purposes; after all, neither vasectomy failure nor saying ""I trusted her"" is an acceptable excuse to avoid paying child support for 18+ years afterwards), I certainly want to *permanently* get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible (as well as to get forehead-focused feminization surgery on my face) once I will become able to afford it (for the record, my planned orchiectomy is certainly my first priority).

Also, please keep in mind that, while I have previously heard some good things about estrogen HRT (such as becoming more emotional), I am unsure that I will actually be able to sustain taking estrogen HRT on a long-term basis; thus, I might have to take testosterone HRT instead.

That being said, I do have some issues with my body. I'd really like to increase the size of my clitoris. I know it's unrealistic to expect it to become the size of a penis (though it would be nice), but I would like to at least have something *there*. I'd even settle for an inch or so of growth.

I have been doing a lot of research and have read that pumping, over time, is supposed to increase the size, so I started pumping this month. I haven't seen any changes yet. I'm not sure if it's because it's a weak pump, or because I'm not wanting to go too hard too fast, or if it's just too soon.

Thus, here goes:

In short, I myself generally identify as a male (though I am certainly also *extremely* willing to adopt a ""eunuch"" label after my (planned) orchiectomy) but also want to have a feminine (hairless) body as well as an androgynous (hairless) face. In addition to this, I also want to wear certain women's clothes on a semi-regular basis. :) Finally, I also want to get prosthetic testicles after my (planned) orchiectomy. (As for the HRT, I will use whatever HRT I am most comfortable with; however, as I have previously stated here, the orchiectomy is non-negotiable due to the current extreme child support laws.) Also, if this makes any difference, I myself get sexually aroused both my imaging myself having prosthetic testicles as well as by imagining myself having a vagina; of course, I certainly place *a lot* of value on things such as penis-in-vagina sex and thus certainly prefer to have a penis plus prosthetic testicles than to have a vagina.

Basically, though, what I am wondering is this: What exactly does it mean when I get sexually aroused by imaging myself having my ideal body and face? Frankly, I feel that after I will sufficiently feminize both my body and my face, I would literally be able to get sexually aroused and to orgasm merely by looking at my own body--preferably with certain female clothes on myself! :)

Indeed, are such feelings normal for transgender and gender non-conforming people? After all, I feel that I can get *almost* as much of an orgasmic experience and *almost* as much sexual joy from merely looking at my own body and face (*after* I will sufficiently feminize both it and my face, that is)--preferably with certain female clothes on myself--than I can get from things such as having penis-in-vagina sex. Heck, during my childhood, I first got *extremely* sexually aroused by the idea of wearing female clothes *way* before I first got *extremely* sexually aroused by the idea of having penis-in-vagina sex (indeed, the former occurred at age 9 or 10--shortly after I began hitting puberty--while the latter occurred shortly before my 16th birthday). Heck, even as late as high school, many--if not most--of my sexual fantasies involved me having a feminine body and face as well as wearing female clothes (as opposed to me having sex with women)! :)

Basically, what I am trying to figure out is the *meaning* of these feelings of mine; indeed, while I certainly know what I want to do in regards to both my body and my face (as well as which female clothes to wear afterwards, of course), I also want to try figuring out the *meaning* of these feelings of mine.

So, the current relationship I'm in is with a cis-het female who I LOVE dearly, as she does me. I worry, though, as the chemistry between us wanes the more my physical features transition to female. Not that I want to really develop any further (which she's fine with), but I've discovered that it's notoriously difficult to find a happy medium, a sweet spot, between genders that can be maintained. It would seem that the the longer I transition, even on relatively low doses, the more I will continue to change.

I guess this is a confession. I dont really know who to talk to about how miserable and helpless i feel... and I don't know if this is the right place but i just need some support or advice from people who have had similar experiences.
 All my life I've wanted to be male... I've identified as male... 

I don't remember a time when I was happy being female. Even when I was very young I felt like I belonged with the boys... as a boy.

The only time in my entire life when I felt happy as a woman was a few years ago, I was in a straight relationship with a cis male, and he gave me my first orgasm. After years of body dysphoria and never enjoying, or even relating to my genitalia he made me feel good about my body for a moment of my life. 

That relationship ended soon after for many reasons, but maybe because of my dysphoria... maybe because of just the person I am. I don't know. 

I now identify as pansexual but haven't had a relationship or sexual encounter since that relationship ended because I'm so unsure of who i am or what i want. 

I can't orgasm without watching porn of cis males masturbating their penis and pretending it's my own body.

I have looked into surgeries and hormones and thought through all the options... but I know thay no mstter hoe far i go or how convincing i look, it won't make me happy. I will never have a real penis, I will always feel like I'm in the wrong body. I will always feel the stares and judgement from society for not conforming or being feminine. 

I don't know what to do. I just want to be a man. I want to be the person I've created in my mind. I want to be male.

I don't know what to do in just felt constantly depressed at every option because I can't just have been born male. 

There is no solution and I can't come to terms with it and be happy with my own body. 

:( 

Thanks for anyone who read or any support / advice.

Basically - no BS. I just want to be a woman. I like women's clothes. I wanna have breasts. I wanna look pretty. I'd love to be treated like a woman by men, and I'd love to be pleasing men. I am not fussed with losing the junk down under, I'm cool with whatever, a vagina or a penis, might just keep it in case i need it later down the path (i.e. if i want to become a parent one day)

But *I guess* I can go the rest of my life as a man if I had to. I just would feel better and more able to live my life how i want to if i was a woman. I'm sorta getting to the point of understanding we really have no purpose in life, apart from biologically to be born, reproduce, then do whatever until we die (just my viewpoint as a nihilist) - whether or not I become trans will not matter at all in the end, because we all die one day. I just don't wanna end up in my forty's and feeling regret like: I should've transitioned when i was younger.

A quick story: I dug out the old xbox today and started up skyrim, created a new game cos its been ages since i played, and I wanted to choose to play as a woman, and spent a good 20 minutes tryna get my character looking how i wanted her (or in the games sense, myself) to look - and I usually always when I play games create or choose a character that looks the most like me ( for some sense of realism, idk? just something i do), but this time I wanted to play as a woman character.

another one: I went to some sort of a flea market / vintage market with my uncle and cousin today to pick out some vinyl records (my cousin is a pianist, my uncle is a DJ, and I'm an audiophile (music enthusiast) and am learning to DJ) - basically, I saw this vintage women's fur coat, which i thought looked really good, soft and comfy, at a different stall for pretty cheap. I was madly thinking of ways I could maybe buy it and sneak it in my bag but i didn't want to raise any eyebrows on the way back home. I think tomorrow I'm gonna catch a bus there and buy it, bring it home in a bigger bag - and wear it when I'm home alone. Only fear is my parents finding it in my room by any chance - trying to explain it to them. Also considered buying some high heel ankle boots that i found and really liked - that's gonna be 2000 times harder to explain if my parents find that.

Please let me know if somewhere else is more appropriate for this post. It's been on my mind since I first saw the show, and my upset hasn't gone away. The first night I was so furious I couldn't sleep.

**Background:** I have been watching the A&amp;E show *The Killing Season*, which revolves around a series of bodies found on Long Island in New York. There is at least one suspected serial killer for four of the bodies, and all the identified women seem to have been sex workers. It's a secluded location, and the perfect place for dumping bodies, especially since most of them hadn't been found for several years. The viewer is led to believe this is hard-hitting journalism that does the work the police are too callous to do. This should be an expose, but falls flat on many regards (mostly the shoddy detective work and sloppy accusations). This particular failure, however, really got under my skin.

**How this relates to this sub:** One of the bodies is identified as ""Asian Male"", since that body was the only non-white person found, and they had external male genitalia (hence the body's identification as male). I will use they/their pronouns. The whole show revolves around solving the cases of the white sex workers, and ""Asian Male"" is likely unrelated to the other bodies. ""Asian Male"" was dressed in women's clothing and was badly beaten, leading some to believe they were killed in a fit of rage by a john (It reminds me of the tragic epilogue to *Paris Is Burning*). At a certain point in the show, there is a promising lead for ""Asian Male"", but there is no sincere follow up. The show's hosts, who are supposed to do the investigative work that the police won't do for these bodies, just continue the cycle with their treatment of ""Asian Male"".

**My problem:** My first issue is the continual referral to ""Asian Male"" as male. Add the possibility that they were a runaway for potentially being trans really breaks my heart, given that even in death, they are not being respected.  The investigators describe the likely murderer as angry at being ""tricked"" really pisses me off. When it comes to identifying the body, the sketches represent ""Asian Male"" with short hair and make no mention of the fact they may have identified as a woman.

My last boyfriend wouldnt define his sexuality, which is fine, except it seemed that he didn't like guys but was dating me anyway, which felt like misgendering to me. I really do believe that because after we had sex a couple times he would CONSTANTLY misgender me. At some point I got fed up when he did it in front of all his friends and I told him that he needed to stop misgendering me, I'm a guy and it fucking hurts to be misgendered. He said in front of everyone ""Well its sorta hard to call you a guy, because you know... I've seen it all"".

It was gross, disrespectful, and scarring for future relationships. I just started dating this guy I've known for years and I REALLY like him, but he just misgendered me last night.

I'm having flashbacks to the same situation, I get close to a guy, we date, and after we have sex I'm no longer a guy to them. It honestly makes me want to be celibate the rest of my life

Wow I wasn't expecting to go that much offtopic, anyway let's keep on rolling, that closing bracket will come eventually, right? So yeah, my parents. You know they've never really hit me, I may have been slapped once or twice, but that's it. Nothing much physically hurtful, it was more of the degrading kind. God I was so scared to be yelled at. I was constantly yelled at. My mother denies it today like she doesn't remember, but I remember the feeling, the anxiety when I was hearing the door opening down stairs (meaning my dad was coming home), I didn't know if I was gonna be yelled at for something I did wrong or not. And you think what? That I would put effort not to get yelled at? Wrong! I could never do my homeworks. How could I? I was feeling like if I ever did my homeworks, my parents were gonna glorify themselves for having yelled at me to a the point that I did my homework. And everytime I was given detention, the anxiety was raging inside, because I knew I was gonna be bawled out. The degrading things I did or say to people, to avoid having my parents yelling at me. Respecting myself or other people was not something I had been taught. What I had been taught was focusing on behaving properly and fearing repression... except the rules were random, and thus behaving properly had no sense, so we can say that I've mostly been taught to fear repression thanks to my good friend Anxiety! So much abuses of power. And although I knew something was not quite well, I was not beaten up by my parents, that meant things were good, right? That's how you differentiate good from bad parents: bad parents beat up their kids. Therefore, mine were necessarily good parents, so things were ok. They're not evil you know, it's just that, my mother feels insecure and fears rejection (who doesn't) and thus needs to controle things a bit, and my father... well, it's complicated, I don't know much about his past, but he's certainly very concerned with his public image. And for the yelling very loudly, I don't why they did that, I don't think they were taking much pleasure out of it, they just didn't realize how destructive that was. They didn't congratulate me much. When I was bringing good marks, my dad was only saying: ""you could have done better"". Chasing after the admiration of a person who degrades you, how unhealthy is that? And about self confidence, that wasn't pretty, not many healthy friends around. About physical affection? Well not much. I mean, I don't remember my mother ever hugging me anytime, and I surely remember my being repulsive to my father touching me (no wonder where my today's urge for physical touch comes from). Still today, I don't know how to put words and talk about it. Also, I have a brother and a sister, and they suffered their own way of that education and are not fully willing to admit it (they are in good relation with our parents). The irony is that they used to make me cry all the time, and now that they put so much effort in locking up my heart, I cannot cry anymore. Okay, enough with background story, CLOSING BRACKEAAEAEAT). Just as a (self) reminder I was listing stuff that was making me doubt being cis, so let's carry on.

I enjoy being around girls (I sometimes reach some ridicilous pick of urge to be surrounded with feminin energy). I find girls' cloth very aesthetic, I like them, I watch girls in the street and enjoy their taste and their way to dress. And about sexual orientation (let's put romantic orientation aside for now), I'm so confused. I'm so attracted to women (in a non sexual way)! With the girls I like, I want to share affection and huging and say sweet words and being kind and telling them that I love them, holding their hands. With boys.. that's the exact opposite. I would theorically enjoy sexual intercourse with a man (with me being penetrated), but when I'm around guys, I'm not that much attracted to them, or just a little, and if they touch me too much, I'm scared it sexual signals.

I'm not sure I'm happy with my social status of man. I sometimes feel it when interacting with a person, the feeling that my being myself is limited. Let's say interacting with that person (let's call him Hector) is metaphorically walking. So, we walk for some time, and we arrive in front of the sea, Hector continues along the sea. Not me. I freeze and look at the horizon. There's something over there. I can feel it. It appeals me. I can't reach it, I don't have a boat. Then I realize that I'm awkwardly standing still, and I follow Hector.

I originally just came to say that if I am transgender, I don't see how I could ever accept it, I don't feel disphoric enough to find the courage to make such a massive change in my life, and I find it a bit sad.

Also you people are very brave for stepping that step and for doing what it requeries to be yourself!

62,2016-11-29 13:54:39,5fiqxt,27,11,"Reddit, 

I'm using a throw away, for reasons. 
I come from a background where masculinity in men is your life blood. I grew up in a farm shooting guns, chopping farm wood, herding cattle and breaking in horses. 
I competed at state level for martial arts. I enlisted into the army and I'm a big, burly, muscular guy. I can defuse IED's, I can kill you with my bare hands, I can kill you from 1100 meters away and I can handle a guy thirty kilos heavier than myself. 

But reddit, here's the thing. I don't know if I'm actually a dude. 

It started off with realisations of small things. When I was a kid, I used to wear my shirt collar around my shoulder. You know how girls sometimes have shirts that reveal their shoulders? Like that. Or I'd sit like a girl, or I'd get ashamed for sitting in the toilet when I had to piss. Or in front of my dad, I'd say 'I want to be cat/wonder/bat-woman' and he'd be like 'son, superman.'

So I shrugged that off and was like 'alright, dad.' And went and did what he said. I want to be clear, my dad is a great guy, he was in Vietnam and he has taught me a lot about work ethic and helped me become who I am, but he's very old fashioned and probably doesn't even know what transgender is so don't judge him to harshly, please. 

So reddit, it went a bit further from there, if you're still reading, thank you. But when I got older, I grew my hair out, I tried on chicks bra a few times, I used to make female gestures and cross my legs, walk sometimes, and even imagine being a female. 
I'd do this in private obviously. But my family started noticing my feminine qualities I think and started bullying me for being gay. And I came close to an emotional break down. 

I stopped, I 'manned up' and joined the military. I got my ass kicked into a man and I felt... out of place. Like when the boys are talking about girls and the girls they fuck and their carousing and shite, I just didn't connect with them. It's hard to explain, but it's like the voice in my head is a girls, not a dudes. 

Even now, I have a missus, and I love her - I'm going to marry her in the next two years. But, sometimes, I like to lay down in bed like a female, or stand like a female, or something like that. And it feels better. I imagine myself with a chicks body and it makes me smile. I like to use female avatars in MMO's and I'm writing a book with a female lead that I can kind of see myself as. In the first draft, I write her as a lesbian, I don't know why. I just did. 

If you're still reading this, I have information that could lead to Hillary's arrest. 

But here's the thing, reddit, I don't know if I amtrans.  If I was, wouldn't I be attracted to dudes? Or if I do trans, won't I stop loving my gf? I don't know if I have body/gender dysphoria so how could I be trans? 

I'm upset, I'm confused, I'm ashamed. I feel like I should do ... something. I didn't cry when I lost my grand father. I didn't cry when my family lost their family home. I didn't cry when I left home, or when I left the army, I didn't cry when I lost a string of other relatives or when I turned my back on my mother for being abusive when i was younger. I didn't cry when my father walked out when I was younger, but I want to cry now.

I grew up in a farm shooting guns, chopping farm wood, herding cattle and breaking in horses. \nI competed at state level for martial arts. I enlisted into the army and I'm a big, burly, muscular guy. I can defuse IED's, I can kill you with my bare hands, I can kill you from 1100 meters away and I can handle a guy thirty kilos heavier than myself. \n\nBut reddit, here's the thing. I don't know if I'm actually a dude. \n\nIt started off with realisations of small things. When I was a kid, I used to wear my shirt collar around my shoulder. You know how girls sometimes have shirts that reveal their shoulders? Like that. Or I'd sit like a girl, or I'd get ashamed for sitting in the toilet when I had to piss. Or in front of my dad, I'd say 'I want to be cat/wonder/bat-woman' and he'd be like 'son, superman.'\n\nSo I shrugged that off and was like 'alright, dad.' And went and did what he said. I want to be clear, my dad is a great guy, he was in Vietnam and he has taught me a lot about work ethic and helped me become who I am, but he's very old fashioned and probably doesn't even know what transgender is so don't judge him to harshly, please. \n\nSo reddit, it went a bit further from there, if you're still reading, thank you. But when I got older, I grew my hair out, I tried on chicks bra a few times, I used to make female gestures and cross my legs, walk sometimes, and even imagine being a female. \nI'd do this in private obviously. But my family started noticing my feminine qualities I think and started bullying me for being gay. And I came close to an emotional break down. \n\nI stopped, I 'manned up' and joined the military. I got my ass kicked into a man and I felt... out of place. Like when the boys are talking about girls and the girls they fuck and their carousing and shite, I just didn't connect with them. It's hard to explain, but it's like the voice in my head is a girls, not a dudes. \n\nEven now, I have a missus, and I love her - I'm going to marry her in the next two years. But, sometimes, I like to lay down in bed like a female, or stand like a female, or something like that. And it feels better. I imagine myself with a chicks body and it makes me smile. I like to use female avatars in MMO's and I'm writing a book with a female lead that I can kind of see myself as. In the first draft, I write her as a lesbian, I don't know why. I just did. \n\nIf you're still reading this, I have information that could lead to Hillary's arrest. \n\nBut here's the thing, reddit, I don't know if I amtrans.  If I was, wouldn't I be attracted to dudes? Or if I do trans, won't I stop loving my gf? I don't know if I have body/gender dysphoria so how could I be trans? \n\nI'm upset, I'm confused, I'm ashamed. I feel like I should do ... something. I didn't cry when I lost my grand father.

64,2016-11-30 19:32:37,5frm43,2,3,"Recently I've been reflecting on how in so many aspects of my life I'm caught in between two things, specifically in relation to my gender identity issues. It's like when I try to hop over to one side I hear the other side calling my name. When I go to the new side I hear the first one calling me back and I just go back and forth like a pendulum swing. I was hoping to open up a discussion with others to see how their experiences relate and what they did about it!

Most of them are physical issues. My body type is tall and skinny/athletic. While I'm certainly not muscular, I do have fairly good muscle definition and a somewhat broad skeletal structure. My shoulders are wide, my hands and feet are of good proportion, but I certainly don't feel manly. In fact, I feel quite small and feminine, which is why I suppose I have these trans thoughts and feelings.

When I'm wearing men's clothing, this becomes uncomfortably obvious to me. I don't fill out my shirts because while my shoulders are wide, they are not big and muscly but small and bony. My hips and legs are small, and so pants either accentuate my skinniness or I wear baggier pants that don't look like they fit right. All of my long sleeve shirts and sweatshirts are too big by the cuff, and because I'm so skinny I usually can't roll up my sleeves without them eventually falling back down. Nearly everything piece of men's clothing I wear results in the disappointing realization that I haven't quite ""made it"" (as far as society is concerned) as a man. I've been able to, in the past few years, correct some of this with adjusting my posture, but that only fixes so much and it still just doesn't feel all right with me. I still don't feel like I'm in the right clothes. I don't feel comfortable.

Well what would be the obvious answer? It would seem to be to wear woman's clothing. While I love the way I look most of the time in women's clothing it isn't always quite right. I feel comfortable, but not completely. I feel sexy, but not always. When I wear woman's clothing the exact opposite thing happens as when I wear men's. In men's clothes it seems all the feminine properties come shining out, but as negatives. In women's clothes all of my masculine properties come shining out, again as negatives.

In woman's clothing my shoulders are too broad, I have to cover up my arms from shoulder to wrist because suddenly they look like I've been lifting everyday for the past three years. My body hair comes spilling out of every spot not covered by clothing, even poking through my stockings. My feet are too big for woman's shoes, my hands too big to comfortably fit through the sleeves I need to wear to cover up my arms without stretching the cuffs. I feel like a big hulking mass trying to squeeze down into these tiny clothes. Maybe it's because I wear my girlfriend's clothes and she's a bit smaller than I am, but I know if I got slightly larger clothes the same issues would arise.

Other issues I'm stuck on are things like facial hair. I grow enough for it to be noticeable, but it's not a full beard. When I have my ""beard"" I look much more masculine, and when I shave it I feel way more feminine, but never quite making the cut either way. Same goes for body hair, but who can keep up shaving your entire body. It's so time consuming and usually ends up uncomfortable so I abandon it until I hate the hair enough to Nair or shave it off.

When I'm with other men, especially if they're not close friends, I feel small and meek. I feel in a sense younger than everyone else. Timid. Like they're all bigger and older and just more of men than myself. It makes me feel like I should be a woman, that I've no place in this world of being a ""man"". But when I'm with a group of women, I feel like the man of the group. I find my voice drop down low sometimes. I can't participate in a conversation how I think I'd truly like to, because I don't feel comfortable showing that part of myself. I feel like I don't belong, similar with how I feel with men, except there's nothing I'd like more than to just be one of the girls and join in in their fun and do girl stuff.

Almost everywhere I go, whoever I hang out with, I don't feel like I really belong. I'm currently working on being myself in every moment, and not feeling like I have to belong to a group or a clique to feel secure in my own being. I'm trying to not react to other people's energy that sway  me into behaving one way or another, but it's difficult because I'm afraid of the judgment that comes from people who don't get you. That's why I love communities like this, because while we're all different in many ways, we share many similar experiences, and so I thank you all for being here for each other when we really need it.

I wanted to be more ""manly."" I'm not too endowed, average, I'd say, kinda on the thinner side.

I have a small chin, high cheek bones, thinner shoulders, soft skin for guy, etc.

Now that time has passed (I'm 25), I find myself not wanting to be more manly, but more feminine. I look to my penis at times and imagine it being a vagina. If it were a vagina, I would be more wanted, I would get more attention, I wouldn't have to try hard to be a ""man""' I could relax.

I've never been with a man. Growing up, I learned that men are mean. It caught me off guard. I was always nice and smiling. They were stern and combative.

Before I knew about sexual orientation. I did have crushes on girls. But there was a time when I called a boy ""cute,"" because he looked like a puppy. I was about 6 or 7.

Around 20 and 21, I found myself try to lose my virginity on sites like POF and adult friend finder. I did with an older woman, she was about 34. 

I didn't have too much more luck. On and off, I would anonymously look for a man. It was a rush.mi never went through with it.

That Rush was similar to the rush I got when I dressed in my mothers lingerie a few times. When I was younger, I used to run her stockings on her calf muscles when she wore them. I really liked how they felt. So about 5 years later, I think that was still in my mind at about 14 when I tried on some of her stuff. My brain released a lot of lovely chemicals at that time, because I felt amazing.


Long story short, I oscillate between wanting to be more masculine and wanting to be more feminine. Being more feminine seems easier to do. But it would turn my life upside down. Also, as I have had some inadequate feelings sexually, I find myself wanting to be with males sexually. This would negate being inadequate and also the thought of it gives me a rush.

I've been looking into getting a binder for honestly probably a few years now. I can't work anymore due to health issues until I can manage to see a doctor, and my parents are homeless. I live in a college residence hall, and that's honestly the only reason I have the things I need. 

Anyway, yeah, long story short, I can't afford a binder. I applied to a few places that send out free ones, but they take months, and there isn't a guarantee that you'll receive one either.

I never thought I would end up being trans, I had no reason to believe so. ive always been a masculine guy (im 22) but ive always been interested in gender and after seeing this one great looking non binary person I came to the realization that I could be more than I am right now. i want to change myself entirely from who i am now (not really related to gender primarily, this sorta came along for the ride). i have a male name ive been going by with select friends but ive still been going by my crappy birthname. ive talked about this with a professional i talk to(not a gender therapist, but a outreach worker of sorts). i cant really act on it now nor do i want to but when i finally am free and on my own, id like to start presenting more femme.

thinking about the person id like to end up being, i feel like having a more feminine physical form would be great, id like to be strong to be able to protect myself and learn some discipline of marital arts(probably boxing/wrestling), be in shape and a good athlete(even as a guy im not really strong or able to protect myself)(also i really love playing basketball,wouldnt mind trying to play mens ball even if i transition). basically i want to not live part of a life, but a whole one. im not really afraid to do me and be different  (i really look up to allen Iverson and latrell spreewell, they did them and didn't care)

my worker mentioned that theres meetings i could go to that are open but i feel like i don't belong cause im still really unsure about myself and i feel like im intruding or overstepping (only ever identified as a cis guy and i have a big beard).

i dunno i guess a good way to describe it is being a reverse tomboy i guess. i don't really have an end question to wrap this all up. im just looking for answers

Frankly, I suspect that this desire on my own part might be unusual for transfeminine people; however, I especially want to hear about the experiences of transfeminine people in regards to this due to the fact that I myself lean more to the feminine than to the masculine side of gender expression.

I'll admit, it was overwhelming, and I didn't post again because it was SO much new information, and because this community thoroughly answered all my questions. I can't even begin to explain how helpful it was and how transformative it was for my outlook.

I had the chance to use my knowledge to politely educate a politician and also a business man (cisgendered) and both have, in turn, gone on to make positive changes in their circles. The big difference was just how kind and patient so many of you were, in spite of my ignorance, and I know that can't always be easy, since you undoubtably deal with willfully ignorant and rude people on a regular basis.

Anyway, I am volunteering with a young adolescent who is genderqueer, although they have sometimes referred to themselves as trans. My instinct is that they are still exploring and discovering themselves, but unfortunately they do not have a ""tribe"" other than people on the internet.

They are very intelligent, very down to earth, very creative, defiant (but I see past the defiance and recognize how kind they are -- the defiance comes from being in an unfriendly environment at school and at home.) They talk in a nihilistic way, with seemingly no hope or goals for the future. Death and dying are a regular talking point.

I told them that it gets easier to find your place as you get older. I mentioned that at my university, there is a very active genderqueer community, and there are even gender neutral bathrooms for those who prefer it (though bathroom use is a personal choice.) There is even a sexuality and gender minor, which I think they may really enjoy. (Because they talk a lot about genderqueer and trans issues, and because they have a level of intellect, introspection and quick wit that tells me it would be something they'd devour.)

Being realistic, though, I doubt there are many good paying, stable careers for gender and sexuality studies alone. I'm trying to brainstorm related areas to major in, where they might use the minor to be a powerful genderqueer professional who makes a real difference in the world.

I was reading the [AMA from the lady with XYGD](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5bemg9/iama_young_lady_with_xy_gonadal_dysgenesis_ama/) and it started me thinking about how there might be many related careers, such as endocrinologist, pharmacist, psychiatrist, social worker, etc. (I realize she is intersex, not trans or genderqueer, but an intersex person could consider themselves genderqueer, and she does have concerns that some trans or genderqueer people may share: hormones, medication, fertility, surgery, gender assigned at birth, etc)

I'm looking for your ideas, especially if you, yourself have found a career that is especially fulfilling because you are trans or genderqueer. (And yes, in the past, this community has educated me that sometimes a trans person considers themselves under the genderqueer umbrella).

Also, obviously trans and genderqueer folks don't necessarily find careers that have anything to do with gender, nor do they need to, but I'm hoping there might be someone in this community who has, OR, who has encountered a professional in their life who was particularly sensitive to gender issues and made a difference in your life.

My instinct is that they are still exploring and discovering themselves, but unfortunately they do not have a ""tribe"" other than people on the internet.\n\nThey are very intelligent, very down to earth, very creative, defiant (but I see past the defiance and recognize how kind they are -- the defiance comes from being in an unfriendly environment at school and at home.) They talk in a nihilistic way, with seemingly no hope or goals for the future. Death and dying are a regular talking point.\n\nI told them that it gets easier to find your place as you get older. I mentioned that at my university, there is a very active genderqueer community, and there are even gender neutral bathrooms for those who prefer it (though bathroom use is a personal choice.) There is even a sexuality and gender minor, which I think they may really enjoy. (Because they talk a lot about genderqueer and trans issues, and because they have a level of intellect, introspection and quick wit that tells me it would be something they\'d devour.)\n\nBeing realistic, though, I doubt there are many good paying, stable careers for gender and sexuality studies alone. I\'m trying to brainstorm related areas to major in, where they might use the minor to be a powerful genderqueer professional who makes a real difference in the world.\n\nI was reading the [AMA from the lady with XYGD](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5bemg9/iama_young_lady_with_xy_gonadal_dysgenesis_ama/) and it started me thinking about how there might be many related careers, such as endocrinologist, pharmacist, psychiatrist, social worker, etc. (I realize she is intersex, not trans or genderqueer, but an intersex person could consider themselves genderqueer, and she does have concerns that some trans or genderqueer people may share: hormones, medication, fertility, surgery, gender assigned at birth, etc)\n\nI\'m looking for your ideas, especially if you, yourself have found a career that is especially fulfilling because you are trans or genderqueer. (And yes, in the past, this community has educated me that sometimes a trans person considers themselves under the genderqueer umbrella).\n\nAlso, obviously trans and genderqueer folks don\'t necessarily find careers that have anything to do with gender, nor do they need to, but I\'m hoping there might be someone in this community who has, OR, who has encountered a professional in their life who was particularly sensitive to gender issues and made a difference in your life.\n\nThank you once again!', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Ciswoman looking for insight (again) from this wonderful community, regarding a genderqueer youth', 'created': 1478493246.0}"

48,2016-11-07 15:40:39,5bmt2w,4,12,"First off, apologies for making another validation post, I wish my first contribution to this sub was less self-centric.

I'm almost 100% to arrange talking with a counsellor - but I'm flapping in the breeze a bit about it - I'm worried that I might be taking my feelings too seriously, but I'm also aware that I've been strongly prone to self denial.  I'm hoping that someone has been through this can relate.

I don't know if I'm agender, genderqueer, dysphoric, trans or going crazy.  Either way, the realisation that there's even a problem has come pretty late at the age of 35.  I think genderqueer may best describe how I feel.

I've played as a kid outside gender roles, and was happiest with gender neutral pursuits.  I can recall various points where my play / thoughts were corrected. 

Gender was a neutral element in relationships - I never wanted to be 'one of the lads'.  Most of my friends were fringe/minority types throughout school.  In college I was part of an exclusively female friend group. I feel as though I've always connected with women better socially than men, but not in an excessive way.  

I've tried to hyper-masculinise at various points, I feel that I expressed masculinity and cissexuality, behind it I have always felt like I'm faking/grandstanding. 

I know I'm physically male, but I don't feel that my default behaviour expresses that at all: my intonation can shift between masculine and feminine, I don't chose to do that - I feel that I have a feminine approach to relationship maintenance - I try hard to mask this in certain situations, or playing it off like a man embracing some softness etc. (maybe around judgemental people)

Even now as an adult, I prefer neutral conversation - I don't feel comfortable in gendered groups.

I have a strange concept of self-image, I can readily accept my appearance, but, I don't always identify with it. It's like there's something off about it. I feel like a weird mix up. objectively I can say that I  have characteristics from both sexes.  Light body hair, generally less angular features, wide hips, shallow brow bone, big eyes and curled long eyelashes, and a round face which I hide with a large, but still patchy, beard. 

Internally I feel like I have both masculine and feminine character ideals of myself inside my mind. The problem is I don't know if I connect to either, or not at all.  I feel much more emotional connection to my feminine preferences (tomboyish geeky), while I've strongly absolutely denied myself these preferences, I feel that it bled out in my career as a designer/artist which is strongly feminine, I've been assumed as female through my art a couple of times.  It's almost like I feel this is the only way of expressing this side acceptably.  I understand dysphoria in a wiki sense, but I don't have a personal perspective, I can only wonder if this sounds like dysphoria?

I've always been interested in things about gender, trans issues etc - I rationalise it as being a superficial interest, but I tend to question myself when reading about these issues, but still never connected my own experience with being transgender.  It wasn't until I looked at this sub, and saw real-world people talking about their experiences that I connected the dots. Now I'm in doubt about myself, and confronting a lot of self-denial.

From quite a young age I was never particularly masculine, but because I never felt trapped growing up, aside from being pansexual and growing up in a small *rural* Australian city. Physically though I enjoy myself and never felt out of place in my own body. For years I just assumed I was a really fey dude. Someone who looked at the curves of their hips and despite the furriness and broadness of their chest found themselves focussing on those feminine aspects just as much.

I found out there was a term for this kind of feeling inside in June this year and it just clicked. I wasn't a feminine man or a masculine woman trapped inside the former. I was... Me.

So I found that Genderqueer as a term of identification of these feelings was closest to what I felt, and maybe I'm wrong so I wanted to ask if perhaps I'm getting it wrong... I don't mind being wrong because learning is the only way to move forward in the world. So am I coming out (because I've sort of done that before and it was scary) or am I transitioning? How do I talk to the people I love about who I am?

Also if there is anyone else from Down Under out there, I'd love to talk to you... Because while I'm happier than I've ever been... I'm still a little bewildered and lost.

    What I can and can’t wear?
    I tried to shave my legs but
    “Boy, god forbid you dare!”
    Who are you to say
    Who I am, and who I can be?


    It’s about me, not you
    Forcing me to be like this
    Makes me feel like the ocean,
    Blue, cold, with lots of death inside
    I’m not not a meltable mold
    I can’t fit in with society

66,2016-11-09 21:23:25,5c3tk7,14,15,"Hey everyone. So I'm in an interesting predicament.  I am in the kendo club at my university, which is Japanese swordsmanship. We use hollow bamboo swords called shinai as our ""weapon"" (its more like a practice tool but I digress) Anyway so these shinai have different lengths and traditionally longer ones are used by men and shorter ones are used by women. Now when I started and bought my shinai all the women's shinai (I'm AFAB) were kind of beat up and the handles were already off-white because of use so I decided to buy a men's shinai (which were new in the plastic) Since my presentation at the time was ambiguous the person handing them to me couldn't tell my gender and just went with it when I bought it. Now its has come to light to some people in my club that I use a Men's shinai. Most of them people I am friends with and some of them just found out because we have a day where we had to take them apart and clean them. 

The thing is I've been read as female by pretty much everyone (at least by now) Initially there were a few people who read me as male, one of whom is probably gay and expressed interest (bless him) before finding I was AFAB after I mentioned leaving my phone in the women's bathroom (I seriously messed up there). In anycase I use the women's lockeroom to change, but at this shinai maintence thing I was told by a few people that I should use a smaller shinai. Also someone asked straight up ""Why would you use a Men's shinai?"" which hurt the most. Way more than I thought it would. Someone at the time said it good for weight training, which kind of backed me up but it still stung in a way I wasn't expecting.

There are many good reasons why I would use a ""men's"" shinai that have nothing to do with being genderqueer (higher weight makes for better strength training, longer shinai provides better reach etc.). The method of assigning shinai length is antiquated since it was developed in the relatively homogeneous Japanese population. Since America has greater disparities in height the gender division of the shinai is an artifact of the times. My friend who I get along with well in the class is a guy and a little shorter than me and he uses a men's shinai. Though despite me being a little taller I would traditionally not be able to use one in tournament. A really tall woman should be able to use a longer shinai in my opinion if it really is about height and stature.

As for how I want people to address me I'm okay with female pronouns, but when I'm reminded of things I can or can't do relating to being female I get antsy. I also sometimes pass for male and I feel pretty good when that happens, though I'm not considering any surgery or hormones. I also don't want to pass full time as a guy.

So I'm not sure what to do... I guess it's just kind of bumming me out and I want to know if anyone has any similar kinds of experiences or advice. I mean on top of this I'm grappling with the whole ""Is it just internalized misogyny?"" thing as well. Like why do I not like being considered a girl? Is it because of a limited idea of what woman are like or can be? Idk.... just rambling at this point. But any comments are well appreciated

I took a few baby steps. One of these was saying to my team at work (new job, been there a couple of weeks) ""Hey guys, I feel weird that I didn't mention this earlier but I was nervous around new people, but uh, you can call me Sam*. Or like if you call me Samantha* that's fine too, it's my name."" 

(My name isn't Samantha but you get the idea.)

I meant for it to be as low-key as possible but there was like a three-second period of awkward dead silence where I could almost HEAR my coworkers thinking ""WHAT? oh god have we been misgendering this person the whole time?"" (My coworkers are all the kind of awesome people who would feel bad about misgendering someone.) 

I didn't say anything about pronouns or whatever but I have been dressing very masculine and I think they picked up that it was a gender thing, because today one of my coworkers said ""Oh yeah, that's the thing Samantha and I were-- SORRY! SAM!"" and got really flustered in a way that you wouldn't get just calling someone by their full name instead of a nickname. 

I also came out to my (cis, queer, very much an ally) BFF who was predictably great, and another close friend who is a trans woman. I've been having a lot of really good convos with the latter friend about our experiences and it turns out we've gone through a lot of the same stuff. (My decision to get a boob job was very similar to her growing a very impressive beard before she was out.) 

The more I think about it, though, the more grateful I am that places like this subreddit and books like Gender Outlaws exist, because the thought of getting full-on top surgery, going on T, and ending up looking like Buck Angel (who is SUPER hot, don't get me wrong) is just as upsetting to me as trying to force myself to be a Woman. 

Part of me feels like I'm just being lazy or cowardly and this is an excuse not to go through another surgery any time soon (getting implants removed) or have to actually change my name or pronouns or go through any of that, but I don't really WANT to. Just being able to say ""I'm trans"" and stop trying to force myself to dress feminine and think of myself as a Woman has helped so much.

I think we've all encountered people-- both cis and trans-- who get mad at folks who aren't totally on one end of the male-female spectrum or the other. I encountered some comments on a different part of reddit yesterday with people complaining about how genderqueer people are an ""insult"" to ""real"" trans people who experience ""real"" dysphoria.

I'm a very nuanced person in my political views.  Respect and balance are very important to me.  I voted for Clinton in large part because I thought she was the more nuanced candidate, and I didn't like the simplicity of Trump's rhetoric. I didn't think Clinton was perfect, nor did I think Sanders, Stein, or anyone else was.  I was registered as a Republican and voted for Kasich in the primary (who I also didn't think was perfect), then switched my registration out of disgust when Trump got nominated.  I don't feel a loyalty to any party and I don't feel like I'm uniformly ""liberal"" in my political views.  I support LGBTQ rights and progressive taxation but I disagree with many things about the democratic party's stances. For example I oppose minimum wages and affirmative action, even though I feel strongly about increasing social mobility, promoting diversity, and addressing institutional racism.  I almost feel like there's a parallel between my gender identity and my political views.  Just like I'm neither female nor male, but share certain qualities with both, and am more of my  own thing, I feel similarly about political parties...I share certain qualities with both but have no loyalty to either and feel more commitment to my own values.

I'm terrified by some of the right-wing ideologies I see voiced by some of the people close to Trump, and I want to take action against these things.

But all around me, my left-wing friends are getting sucked into this sort of ""all-or-nothing"" opposition to Trump that I find troubling.  A lot of my friends are going to protests, and the people organizing the protests and the material put out by them, doesn't reflect my values.  And people are sharing stuff on FB that I really disagree with.  They are doing things like shaming Trump and his supporters as ""bigots"" and ""homophobes"" and ""racists"" and things like that.  It is against my values to ever use negative labels to refer to people.  I associate name-calling with the trauma of bullying that I had to put up with as a kid, and with the abuse and dismissal that sometimes gets hurled at me by other adults as an adult.  And like, it seems super disturbing for me to see people who claim to be my ""ally"", engaging in some of the behavior that I find most troubling and hurtful.  I don't care if they're directing it at someone who is trying to take away my rights, I feel like when people attack Trump and his supporters in this disrespectful way, they're attacking me, because I see their rhetoric as like, fueling this us-vs-them mentality that is just going to harm LGBTQ rights and all the other issues I feel passionately about.

I have read some things written by Trump voters and I know that it's more complex than this...that many of the people who voted for Trump actually support LGBTQ rights and voted for him for other reasons, like discontent with the political establishment, disagreeing with other aspects of mainstream liberal ideology, or the like.

I guess I wanted to throw this out there, I want to see if there are any other people out there, trans people and nonbinary people and other LGBTQ people who are terrified about Trump but also feel left behind, alienated, or even equally terrified by the extremism in the anti-Trump reactions.

I've had a few people express confusion over my pronouns (they/them/their), so I figured I'd post a quick guide/FAQ.

Here's how to use they/them/their pronouns:

""Do you know if &lt;&lt;rivercitykitty&gt;&gt; is coming to the party? If they are coming, I want to play some Magic with them. I heard their new deck is awesome!""

(New pronouns do not change the fact that I am a huge nerd. Nothing will change the fact that I am a huge nerd.)

Frequently asked questions:

* **I'm probably gonna screw this up.**

* Yeah, probably. I appreciate you trying, and I know that there's a big difference between accidentally misgendering me and doing it on purpose. Don't make a big deal out of it, though! Think what you'd do on the street if you called a long-haired guy ""ma'am"" from behind-- a quick apology, ""Oh, sorry sir"" and move on. (Just, you know, *without the ""sir""*.)

* **""They is"" sounds wrong.**

* I agree! I prefer plural verbs, as shown above. You should know that some people do prefer singular verbs, and if they do you should do your best to accommodate.

* **Isn't it grammatically incorrect to use ""they"" for a single person?**

* A, no. It's common in spoken English, and has been seen in writing as far back as the 13th Century! You almost certainly do it daily. B, who cares? If a friend asks you to do something grammatically incorrect because it makes them feel better, do you hurt your friend or grammar?

* **Don't we already have a singular third-person gender-neutral pronoun in ""it""?**

* English also has a distinction between animate and inanimate pronouns, and ""it"" is inanimate, like ""these"" and ""those."" It's grammatically incorrect to use ""it"" for people, and there's also a long history of ""it"" being used as a slur. Don't do it.

* **Doesn't this make it hard to tell if I'm talking about one person or a group?**

* Probably a little more than you're used to, but not as much as you think. Most of the time it's obvious from context. If you're concerned about ambiguity, it's usually only a little effort to re-word your sentence so that the ambiguity goes away. And if you can't do that, just drop the pronoun and use names!

* **Why not other gender-neutral pronouns like ""xe,"" ""ze,"" or ""ey""?**

* Honestly, I think ""they"" is the most natural solution for gender-neutral pronouns in English. It rolls off my tongue better and is, I think, easier to get people to use. Obviously, I use specific constructed pronouns if people request them.

* **What should I do if I encounter somebody whose pronouns I don't know?**

* ""They/them"" is a pretty safe default, and most folks will not be offended if you ask, sincerely, what their pronouns are. I know that when people ask me, I'm pretty ecstatic. If you're shy, you can also listen to what their friends call them.

116,2016-11-18 00:58:45,5djlk8,25,50,"So, I'm born female, struggled with my gender and sexual identity all my life until recently. 

When I began dating the girl who I now know is my true love, she was so open and honest about her own experience with transition that it wasn't long before I tearfully admitted to her that I've always felt like my birth body didn't match up with how I wanted to be seen.

For a long time, I struggled with that big secret (""I want to be a boy""), and then- it was out. And then I realized, I had never considered what kind of boy I wanted to be, so in the safety of a few trusted friends and with my partner, I began to explore and give a voice to those long repressed feelings and desires. I began to read about non-binary trans identities and experiences, and to express myself in a way that was much more fluid and queer. I realized I always wanted to be someone whose identity was fluid, because cramming myself in a box on either side of the spectrum proved to be miserable in every way. I wanted to be androgynous. I wanted to move the slider over, so that no matter where on the spectrum I woke up, I could feel comfortable.

Finally, just last week, after months of consulting with my doctor, doing the bloodwork, and so on, he asked me if I would like to start my HRT that day. I balled up my fists and said... Yes. Why not? Let's do it. I only have one life to live, I want to start a low dose of T, and keep doing what was working so well for me- taking it a day at a time. Listening to myself. Seeking the support of community. And never trying to fit into a box again.

So far... well- psychologically the effects have been mindblowing. This last year, I've made great strides in taking care of my mental health for once, having never really done so. I stopped drinking. I'm far from better, but now I'm in a place where I don't feel like every step is a landmine. And within a day of that first injection... I felt so at peace. So unified. So calm. 

The best way I've been able to describe it is this: I've always thought of this dysphoria and this deep hurt and feeling of not belonging as having two people trapped in the same body, one of which who never really got a chance to thrive. Think teenage angst times 11. But finally, I threw my boy side a bone. I acknowledged that he exists and that he's felt trapped and upset. But now he feels validated, he's stopped throwing temper tantrums. He's even admitted that he's not particularly interested in the culture of masculinity, he just wanted to be heard. I know it sounds silly. 

But suddenly I feel so much more comfortable in my skin, long before any physical changes have happened. My partner said her psychological relief was almost instant when she began HRT as well, long before she experienced the physical changes. Now I understand it.

Currently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I'm not sure. I've already broken most of the ""rules"" and I've never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I'll just keep living it, day by day.

I love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn't secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I've ever had. 

I won't pretend things aren't hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn't for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.

Now I understand it.\n\nCurrently, I am taking the HRT day by day. My plan is to continue with the half dose and just keep feeling it out. Do I want to fully transition? Do I want to continue on a low dose until I feel androgynous enough to stop? I\'m not sure. I\'ve already broken most of the ""rules"" and I\'ve never felt more like my life was actually worth living, so I\'ll just keep living it, day by day.\n\nI love you all and I just wanted to share- this community, among others here, helped me out more than I could ever say. If I hadn\'t secretly browsed /r/lgbt 4 years ago and wandered my way over to /r/genderqueer, I probably would have spent another decade drinking to blackout several times a week, resenting my cis partner and myself, cutting my skin and thinking about suicide constantly. That was me, a year ago. Now I am engaged in the gayest, queerest, genderless lesbian husband/wife relationship with the best friend I\'ve ever had. \n\nI won\'t pretend things aren\'t hard right now, but I think these are the times that the positive must shine through for an example- I never would have been brave enough if it wasn\'t for all the beautiful, visible queers shining like stars and giving my repressed, miserable self some hope, something to strive for.\n\nThank you all.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Nonbinary, gender fluid...

I've been lurking here for too long, and I finally decided to make an account to join the community, mainly for selfish purposes (I wanna get advice from all you wise genderqueer elders). Warning: I'm about to overshare about my mental health (and use too many parentheses).

So I'm eighteen years old and just started college. I'm finding myself completely unable to make friends. I have horrid anxiety issues along with a healthy dose of depression. There might also be some PTSD thrown in there resulting from a very emotionally manipulative friendship a few years back (I'll spare you all the details, but suffice to say it still keeps me up at night). Aside from all that, I'm quite suicidal and can't imagine myself living too much longer.

Meanwhile, I've been wrestling with some gender issues. I started wondering over the summer whether I might not be the female everyone thinks I am. This came from a variety of things: I was mistaken for a boy twice in a row (ironically, since then, I have not managed to pass as anything but female) and realized I liked it. I then experimented a lot with masculinizing makeup and was overjoyed to see my new ""male"" face. I also became more aware that when I heard people talk about me, I felt prickly and sick, like I wanted to punch someone and throw up and cry at the same time, which was different from the way my anxiety normally made me feel. I began to realize that this got a thousand times worse when they used ""female"" terms and pronouns for me. I had never deconstructed and analyzed my anxiety like this before, but it seemed to make a lot of sense.

So for a few months, I asked some of my close friends (while I was still at home over the summer) to use they/them pronouns for me. It felt so much better. I was thrilled to come to college, away from my homophobic/transphobic family, and start over by introducing myself with they/them pronouns to everyone. I was much too naive. Everyone here still sees me as a girl, no matter what I do, and they seem to love throwing ""she""s and ""hey girl!""s in my face. Before this summer, I had never hated certain parts of me, I was rather indifferent to them. Now I hate my name and my voice; I don't despise my chest quite as viscerally as the other things, but I secretly ordered myself a binder and sobbed with joy once I put it on, because it felt like my body was finally shaped right. I keep having dreams that my arms and legs have grown thick, wonderful hair (I don't know why, but I'm really fixated on body hair, lol).

And yet, true to form, I'm worried about all this. My mental health is so completely unstable that I don't think I can know for sure who I am. What if I just made up my identity because I'm lonely and I'm desperate to justify why I don't fit in? What if this is somehow coming from that traumatic experience years ago? What if I'm just hoping part of my anxiety is due to dysphoria because dysphoria is something you can physically fix?

I don't know. I'm lonely and I'm tired. I wish I could go to sleep tonight and wake up with a new body and start over completely. (Or, y'know, not at all, but that's probably not my best option.) Anyway, I was hoping maybe someone here would understand and be able to help me. Does what I'm going through sound like dysphoria, or am I totally off base?

Basically, after I will get my orchiectomy (which is non-negotiable due to the fact that I need it for sterilization purposes; after all, neither vasectomy failure nor saying ""I trusted her"" is an acceptable excuse to avoid paying child support for 18+ years afterwards), I certainly want to *permanently* get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible (as well as to get forehead-focused feminization surgery on my face) once I will become able to afford it (for the record, my planned orchiectomy is certainly my first priority).

Anyway, my question here is this--considering that I myself am unfortunately *extremely* hairy right now everywhere on my body other than on my back, how exactly should I go about this? Also, please keep in mind that, while I have previously heard some good things about estrogen HRT (such as becoming more emotional), I am unsure that I will actually be able to sustain taking estrogen HRT on a long-term basis; thus, I might have to take testosterone HRT instead.

I've been in a gender questioning phase for a while and as much as I like the thought of being a girl, im just not sure how to know for sure whether or not I am transgendered. In the past year, a lot has changed. I've stopped identifying as a male and more as gender-queer and ive been slowly breaking the shackles of gender role constraints. I have changed my look and my out-look with the way I think of myself in relation to the world in terms of gender. I feel comfortable knowing im not a man, rather than feeling like I am a man that wishes they were something else. The thing is, I really want to be a girl, but I dont know if that is the same thing as being a girl. I read many stories from trans people where they say they always knew in some way or another. I can remember trying on my mom and sisters clothes at a young age and looking at myself in the mirror. Also, ive been bisexual since I was 14 and came out as such when I was 18, but when I had sex with men I always thought of myself as the woman, even asking them to imagine me as one. I also recall since I was around 15-16 thinking exclusively about being a girl anytime I fantasized about something sexual. Even when I would watch porn I would always imagine that I was the girl. 

Now this is the tricky part because even though there are signs I want to be trans for reasons other than sexual reasons, I do feel that since sexuality is somewhat of a factor in my decision to transition, does that mean im teetering on being a fetishist that is doing it for the wrong reasons?? Also, I would love to get on hrt but I dont think I would ever get gender reassignment surgery, and in fact I really adore the look of the MTF body, and I even love the idea of being a trans woman in a relationship with another trans woman. That would be an ideal situation in my mind, and not only for sexual reasons. 

So there's a lot there, and there are other reasons I feel I might be trans, but at this point after thinking about it for so long should I know for sure???

The thing is, I really want to be a girl, but I dont know if that is the same thing as being a girl. I read many stories from trans people where they say they always knew in some way or another. I can remember trying on my mom and sisters clothes at a young age and looking at myself in the mirror. Also, ive been bisexual since I was 14 and came out as such when I was 18, but when I had sex with men I always thought of myself as the woman, even asking them to imagine me as one. I also recall since I was around 15-16 thinking exclusively about being a girl anytime I fantasized about something sexual. Even when I would watch porn I would always imagine that I was the girl. \n\nNow this is the tricky part because even though there are signs I want to be trans for reasons other than sexual reasons, I do feel that since sexuality is somewhat of a factor in my decision to transition, does that mean im teetering on being a fetishist that is doing it for the wrong reasons?? Also, I would love to get on hrt but I dont think I would ever get gender reassignment surgery, and in fact I really adore the look of the MTF body, and I even love the idea of being a trans woman in a relationship with another trans woman. That would be an ideal situation in my mind, and not only for sexual reasons. \n\nSo there's a lot there, and there are other reasons I feel I might be trans, but at this point after thinking about it for so long should I know for sure??? Like is my uncertainty a sign that im probably not trans?"", 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Wondering if im trans, seeking advice or discussion', 'created': 1479891999.0}"

This spawns from the ""controversial"" joke Colin Jost made on SNL last weekend about transgender identities (link at bottom). I'd be happy to discuss the joke, but I'm more interested in discussing Tinder's new identity options specifically.

I was surprised to hear the number 37, and to learn that there are a number of additional identities beyond these. Seemed like a lot. So I did some reading.

Androgyne and androgynous. Androgyne is ""A person who *fits both physical characteristics* or feels like they are both a male and female."" So, even if they identify as male, but fit both physical characteristics, they could be considered androgyne? Meanwhile, androgynous is ""the combination of masculine and feminine characteristics."" They seem to be saying the same thing, and neither seem to be an identity, more of a physical description.

Gender nonconforming is ""people who do not follow other’s ideas or stereotypes about how they should look or act based on the female or male sex they were assigned at birth."" I don't understand how this is a gender identity. A male who is fine with acting in a manner generally considered by society to be feminine, or vice versa, is a gender identity? Don't you first have to identify as male or female, by definition, to fit this description? 

Genderqueer or non-binary. This one I fully understand..but it seems like it covers SO many bases. How can there be 50+ identities if one of them is basically ""does not give a fuck what other people think about gender identities."" I understand this is a very important one so please, inform me.

Two-spirit. ?? I don't understand this at all. I don't understand what it means or how it has anything to do with gender identity. Seems like any identity could describe themselves as two-spirit.

And on and on. To be clear, again, I'm not attacking anyone or calling this stupid, it just seems a lot of these identities are redundant or not gender identities at all but more behaviors/preferences/attitudes.

146,2016-11-26 04:01:01,5exn8m,4,3,"Hi to all the awesome readers!


~~So I have a bit of an issue.~~
**My issue is now solved, read comments and last paragraph for details**


**A little background**

I’ve been publicly out as NB for about 7 months, and as I finally started to live as myself, I’ve also became confident enough to explore the possibility of a relationship. I’ve been doing a lot of playing around with what to disclose and how to build my profile, but so far nothing has been really working out. Most of the services I’ve used only support Male/Female genders but I’ve been explaining my identity in the first few lines of profile description or in the first few messages with whomever I’ve been talking to. As I present more feminine this days, and the relationship I’m after is more of a lesbian relationship than a straight one (and I’m not into masculine individuals or gay sex) that’s how I’ve been recently building my profile and declaring on sites which don’t provide more specific identities and orientations. But my presentation is all due to make-up, cloths and well lit pictures, I haven’t altered my body.


**The situation**

Recently I’ve started exchanging messages with a girl living just few hours away, and we are really getting along. She is bi (was in a straight relationship before, but is looking for a female partner now). I’ve explained to her very early I’m NB. But while most people would freak out at that point or ask me about my genitalia or at least which gender I was assigned at birth - she did not we’ve just move on with the conversation for the night. The next day I casually mentioned it again and explained what pronouns I use, and we had a bit of a chat about a mate of hers who is transgender (FtM), but still she didn’t ask me anything about my gender. But from the way she talks about me or our relationship so far, it feels like she thinks I was AFAB. I’ve added her as a friend on Facebook few days ago - it’s same account as I’ve used when I was still identifying as male and includes a lot of my old pictures so I thought if she does any snooping around the topic would come up, but it still hasn’t.


**My issue**

Now I feel torn, on one hand I feel like I’m falling in love with someone who likes me just the way I am - possibly the first person I’ve met who sees me as I am today and respects my identity, without caring about the past. On the other I feel that by not spelling it out to her I’m lying or at least deceiving her, and that makes me feel awful. I don’t even care if knowing the truth would mean we stop talking, but I don’t want her to fall in love with me thinking I’m a girl and break her heart when the topic does eventually come about… 


We’ve been messaging and sending casual pictures (we both agreed no nudity over the phone) but we really want to meet in person and plan on doing so in just a couple of weeks. And while I think that because she is bi, and because of how well we match each other mentally our relationship could work and develop further anyway, I also feel like I need to be clear with her before we meet or go any further.


How do I come out to her about my body before we meet? Or am I obsessing over nothing?

**Conclusion**
I was sitting on a bus trading cute messages with her when among the questions she came up with was ""Do you want kids?"", I've realised my oportunity to explain everything, so after a few more messages I've expalined that I lived as a male for about 20 years, and I'm pre-HRT and unsure about surgery. She was extreamly supportive, I mean no friend or familly member was as understanding and eager to learn as she is. I'm the first NB/Genderfluid person she knows, so the idea is still a bit confusing to her, but she is as eager to learn about is as I am to explain it so we are off to a good start :) And even I am still experimenting and trying to find my true identity.

And while I think that because she is bi, and because of how well we match each other mentally our relationship could work and develop further anyway, I also feel like I need to be clear with her before we meet or go any further.\n\n\nHow do I come out to her about my body before we meet? Or am I obsessing over nothing?\n\n**Conclusion**\nI was sitting on a bus trading cute messages with her when among the questions she came up with was ""Do you want kids?"", I\'ve realised my oportunity to explain everything, so after a few more messages I\'ve expalined that I lived as a male for about 20 years, and I\'m pre-HRT and unsure about surgery. She was extreamly supportive, I mean no friend or familly member was as understanding and eager to learn as she is. I\'m the first NB/Genderfluid person she knows, so the idea is still a bit confusing to her, but she is as eager to learn about is as I am to explain it so we are off to a good start :) And even I am still experimenting and trying to find my true identity.

148,2016-11-26 15:20:15,5ezvrh,13,31,"Hi, /r/genderqueer.

I need to talk about something. Sorry for the long post. I hope someone will read it anyway.

I'm 26 years old, AFAB, and I currently feel a bit...dejected. I guess I'm genderqueer in some way or other. I've never *really* felt like a woman. I remember walking to school when I was 13 or so, thinking *""why don't I feel like a girl?""*, and I remember feeling really happy when someone mistook me for a boy when I was 9. For *a long time* I thought all girls/women felt this way. I thought it was something that happened to everyone and that every girl/woman feels more masculine at times. About a year or so ago (late, I know) I realised that's not the case, which is when I started to really question things.

I don't have a specific label yet. I really don't know what I am. I sort of feel like a woman but at the same time I *really* don't (I'm okay with female pronouns though). However, I don't feel like a man either. Sometimes I think I feel like both a man and a woman and sometimes I think I feel like neither. I don't know. It's confusing. Anyway, I don't really feel like I *need* a specific label when it comes to my gender identity. I could just say I'm genderqueer if that makes me comfortable, right? Anyway, I do have a problem. A big problem.

I *hate* the way I look. I'm overweight, which contributes to the problem, but that's something I can fix by eating healthier and exercising more (I've already lost some weight so I'm working on it). Some things I can't fix, though, are my feminine body parts. Specifically my breasts. I hate them. Always have. Always will. Of course the universe had to gift me a large pair of breasts (D cup or so). I hate them so much and I would *gladly* get a breast reduction if that was possible. I mean, all I want is to look more androgynous but that's impossible with two alien lumps of fat permanently placed on my chest. The way I dress is fairly androgynous but I fail at looking the way I feel like I *should* look like because of my breasts. They ruin everything and right now I feel like I'll never be able to look the way I want to look, which makes me sad.

My hatred towards my breasts comes and goes. I mean, I *never ever* like them (never have, never will) but the intensity of the thoughts/feelings varies. I don't know if this qualifies as dysphoria (?) but I just wish I could do something about it. I've thought about binding but I have *no idea* where to start or how to deal with potential questions from other people if I suddenly have a flatter chest than usual. For some reason I feel like can't put myself in that position until I know *what* I am, but even if I had a specific label I worry that people wouldn't understand.

I don't know if I want much smaller breasts or if I want don't want any at all. Well, I definitely wish I had never developed breasts but I don't know if I want top surgery. Does that make sense? Anyway, I just *really wish* I was flat-chested.

For as long as I can think of, I've never felt like ""One of the guys."" I can hang out with guys at times, and feel pretty okay with it at times. What I don't feel okay with, however, is being seen as ""just one of the guys.""

In the same vein, however, I've never completely felt like ""One of the girls"" either. Like, I can be around girls and actually feel more chill and at ease, but feel a lot of unease as well. It's kinda like being around both groups makes me more aware that I don't fully identify with either group.

Now, as for when people talk about me, I'm okay with being addressed as a guy, but that gets a little awkward at times when I know I'm seen as a guy, but want to talk more girly stuff.

Another thing that has made its way into my thoughts, my lack of more feminine looks on the upper half of my body. I have a very typical male baldness, and also can grow some moderately thick facial hair. From my face and head alone, I'm seen as a guy. That makes wanting to wear some more feminine items a little awkward as there is an immediate disconnect at my neck.

Another thing, I've lately taken to the idea that wearing a bra under my girls tops actually makes them feel, well, better. It's like there's something missing when the bra isn't there that isn't when the bra is there. Even though I don't have boobs, even wearing something like a sports bra or an A or B cup bra seems to make the tops just fit better.

Another thing, I don't hate my penis. Granted I almost always am a sitter when I pee, and always have a pair of panties on, I don't hate the existence of my penis. It's more like I could do without it, but I don't see myself wanting to remove it right now.

When I was old enough to do so, I bought my own pair of thigh-highs and kept them hidden under my bed. I would wear them secretly at night under my jeans/socks. I would think about what it'd be like to wear other items, but I was always too afraid to buy them. I used to tuck myself between my legs to see what it would look like, and sometimes I would even use ""female"" techniques to touch myself and get off. At some point, I stopped thinking about those things for a while.

Then a couple of years ago, I found myself wanting to wear panties. I started wearing cotton panties because I liked how soft they felt compared to men's underwear, even if they didn't always support me properly. I also started wearing tights/pantyhose whenever it was cold outside. I liked how they made my legs feel.

About a week ago, my girlfriend was out of town and I found one of her bras laying around. In a moment of spontaneity, I tried it on as well as some of her other clothes. Her skinny jeans felt/looked amazing (and actually gave my nonexistant ass some shape). I liked how I looked with a shirt on over my ""new"" bra-induced curves. That was a pretty confusing moment for me. I'm not sure if it was because I felt sexy or what. I have since bought my own ""secret"" bra (36A) that I could wear under my regular clothes.

However, I have always considered myself as just a sensitive guy who is in touch with his anima or feminine side. That I'm ""emotionally feminine."" I find it hard to relate to machismo. Having said that, I used to practice self defense martial arts and I loved it - I felt very badass..empowered...""manly."" I sport a full beard. I used to have a ponytail, but I am balding and it didn't look so good so I shaved it all off. I like my ""manly appearance,"" and I don't hate my genitals or secondary sex traits. I generally identify as a male, who wants to be a better man (by moral/ethical standards) - but I also feel this feminine side begging to be acknowledged and related to by women (in the purest platonic sense).

I have noticed that at certain times of the year, I feel more ""in touch"" with my feminine side. Lately I have felt like crossdressing at home when nobody is around. I have wanted to go shopping for women's pants/jeans to see what fits and looks good. This time last year, I considered presenting myself online as a female version of myself (even came up with a name). I also did something similar when I was a teenager. 

So I'm mostly just confused. On the one hand, I never felt like I was assigned the wrong gender and I have no desire to rid myself of my facial/chest hair.

4,2016-11-02 03:58:01,5anvz5,1,11,"So I've hit a crossroads in my life.  I went out over Halloween weekend as very openly gender fluid to a party with some friends.  My costume was not drag per se, just me being a genuinely feminine presenting fallen angel.  It was bit nerve wracking because it meant coming out to several friends and acquaintances, but I am fortunate that all of them have a progressive view about gender and it was by and large a non-issue to them.  Some of them have even said that I've become much less of an enigma to them, and though I was nervous I was super comfortable for the first time.  After more contemplating over the weekend, and realizing that presenting as masculine is something that in all reality has been a bit alien to me, don't see any need to delay it any longer.  I am ready to do a non binary transition.

Transition for me will largely be a social one, though there will be some minor cosmetic and medical things done.  The big one is giving myself far more freedom than ever to be able to present more andro to femme, and finding out what aspects of masculinity that I really want.   It will be a process and not done overnight, but it's like I'm now all awake and excited to finally be truly me, and literally decades of stress has starting to crumble.

I won't bore people with the details that I've covered on my previous post (https://redd.it/59mfsk), but two areas that I'm going to tread lightly, at least for now is work, and family.  Workwise, I'm in a contracted position and want the opportunity to at least get a stable role before I'm ready to take a plunge at anything beyond a gender neutral presentation.  Much the same with family, particularly with my siblings since I'm quite fond of my nephews and nieces whom I don't want to be denied contact with.

One area that I'm needing advice on is that I've been pretty active in a number of outdoor recreational groups on Meetup and Facebook. I've met some good people in these groups, many of whom became good friends, and have even gotten to the level of organizing events with those groups.  I tend to lean gender neutral during any kind of athletic activity, but I know I'll want to femme it up a bit if it's more of a social gathering.  I'm not sure how to approach that.  I want to strike the balance of being more me, but also doing what I can to being openly gender fluid a by and large non-issue.  Suggestions?

I'm trying to experiment at my own pace. I purchased a gc2b binder and I wear it almost everyday. I was really emotional when I put it on and really happy. I think the idea of having a more masculine body felt natural to me. I'm hoping to purchase men's clothes to experiment with my gender expression.

As I've been realising these feelings, my dysphoria has gone into overdrive. I recognise now my strong waves of feeling male whilst knowing I'm AFAB. These have been consistent for a good few weeks. 

My body sometimes feels like a shell that I'm in. There are times where I seriously feel I'm being misgendered, I feel this sinking feeling or disconnect as someone calls me ""she"" or ""her"". Sometimes it upsets me or I feel incredibly insulted.

It was becoming difficult socialising because when I was in a situation with just women, I felt like the only guy there. But now I know why, it's easier. Also when I'm amongst guys, I sort of feel like I'm one of them. 

I imagine myself daily as male in everyday situations and it makes me really happy. I think for a long time I've thought of myself as somewhat male, and felt that I'm more myself, if not cooler, that way. I'm perfectly comfortable with people using male pronouns.

I can't justify calling myself a cis woman anymore. Although I've lived as one, it doesn't feel like it describes me as a whole. I go through this whole gender confusion and always end up feeling that I'm a trans guy. I'd like to try living/presenting as one and see how I feel. 

But I feel that if I truly was a binary trans guy, surely I wouldn't be in gender limbo this much. I get fleeting moments where I feel like my assigned gender at birth again somehow? So bizarre.

Back to the point, I'm having rather strong gender dysporia at the moment of posting this, and thought I'd seek some interaction with people similar to me, maybe that helps.

I have a pitifully bad memory, So I can only share shards of my own story

Realising I'm genderfluid came around 3, or 4 years ago maybe, though that was more when I recognised the facts that Yes, what I often feel is dysphoria, yes, i is caused becaus in those moments, I want to be a girl, and that was when I got familiar with the term.

Before that, I just... Felt sad an uncomfortable in my own body, jealous of girls for their beauty and well, the isnane variety of clothing. (Crossdressing is out of the question for me, it'd be like if you put a Tutu on a Bear) 
In those times, I often gone on the interne, to chat services, and posed as a girl. It gave me so much comfort. 

The next phase, a few years ago, that lead to the realisation, was... well, this needs context.

Central to my unrest is my planned non binary transition, and questioning if it was now a wise move considering the political shift to the right.  I woke up, and though my body was a bit stubbly from being on a camping trip, decided to slip into one of my favorite dresses, a pair of hose, and some heels.  What I found was very uplifting.  Though I looked very tired and somber, I found I was able to walk around more elegant and graceful than ever, which anybody who wears heels knows is easier said than done.  It made me realize that I am very much still me, being in touch with my feminine attributes still completes me, and that I can still transition even with Donald Trump as president and the GOP controlling Congress.

I know that in doing this, I will need to reach for bigger strength than would have previously been needed, and there will be extra challenges.  But I know I can do it.  It's going to be rough, and I'll be reaching out more than ever to other genderfluid, non binary, trans, and the rest of the LGBTQ+ community for support, advice, mentorship, and some basic support more than ever.  But I know that I can't go on putting on a shell of a seemingly masculine enough male forever.

As I've mentioned before, I am very blessed to be in the Seattle area, which remains a liberal ray of light in an increasingly red political landscape.  But I know that not every LGBTQ+ person has the same location privilege that I do, and many are in GOP territory, whether the traditional Bible Belt or the rust belt states that unexpectently went for Trump.  If you find yourself in need of a person to talk to, please reach out.  I want to be sure we can band together and weather this red storm that will eventually pass.

One other thing that came as a revelation to me.  Remember that not all Republicans, Trump supporters, working class cisgender white folks, etc. are necessarily hostile to people who are gender fluid.  I have personally known people who have conservative political views but totally ""get"" being gender fluid. Let's not treat them like the enemy when they demonstrate an ability to want to understand and possibly support us, and to take the time to explain what being gender fluid, trans, etc. means in ways that they can understand.

Him telling me, the first person he's talked to about it, that he thinks he's gender fluid is a huge step and I want to make sure we keep taking steps. 

We were both raised by parents who didn't understand. When my dad found out I was dating a girl he tried to ""whip the gay out of me"" and forced me to switch schools. That was my freshman year of high school, when the only person I'd ever kissed was the boy who tried to rape me. That wasn't enough for my family to pull me, the forced kiss and groping and pushing me to my knees. But the possibility of my kissing the same sex? I was yanked immediately. I think I'll always hate my family a little for that. I've never been able to forgive it. But, I met the love of my life at that new high school, so good can come from bad. 

My boyfriend's dad passed away when he was young. His mom struggled to raise him and his siblings. Over all, all three are good people. The oldest will probably live on the couch his entire life and the youngest is in and out of the hospital because of her eating disorder but... trust me. Their mom did the best she could. The damage to the others is easier to see. It's in their aspirations and medical records. My boyfriend is different.

His mom realised very quickly that he would be the man of the house and tried to mould him that way. He knows a man's role and feels like he has to live up to it. Even now he will want something and cry because he doesn't think he can have it and then hate himself for crying.

He's always wanted to put streaks in his hair, something I already do, so when it's time to redo my hair I always offer. He always says his mom would never forgive him and gets sad, so I hold him. I'm glad he lets me do that much. 

I don't know how to help him with this. Is watching him go through this all I can do? Am I doing the right thing by just trying to be supportive? Should I push him to do what he wants more? 

The one thing he doesn't doubt, and I'm so thankful he doesn't, is my love for him. I've been honest with him about my being pansexual, which means to me loving someone without gender or sexuality being a factor, since day 1. I think that's soothing to him.

He's asked me to put eyeliner on him when we get the chance. ""Will baby help me look pretty?"" He asked and I got to tell him that he was already beautiful. I think my biggest issue is that I don't know when he wants to be treated like a girl and be held and called beautiful versus when he wants to be my protector and man. I've never guessed wrong and beckoned him into my arms to be held when it wasn't the correct action but how many times have I not risked the guess and let him feel guilty for wanting the situation to be swapped while he held me? I don't want him to feel guilty for who he is anymore. What can I do?

Their mom did the best she could. The damage to the others is easier to see. It\'s in their aspirations and medical records. My boyfriend is different.\n\nHis mom realised very quickly that he would be the man of the house and tried to mould him that way. He knows a man\'s role and feels like he has to live up to it. Even now he will want something and cry because he doesn\'t think he can have it and then hate himself for crying.\n\nHe\'s always wanted to put streaks in his hair, something I already do, so when it\'s time to redo my hair I always offer. He always says his mom would never forgive him and gets sad, so I hold him. I\'m glad he lets me do that much. \n\nI don\'t know how to help him with this. Is watching him go through this all I can do? Am I doing the right thing by just trying to be supportive? Should I push him to do what he wants more? \n\nThe one thing he doesn\'t doubt, and I\'m so thankful he doesn\'t, is my love for him. I\'ve been honest with him about my being pansexual, which means to me loving someone without gender or sexuality being a factor, since day 1. I think that\'s soothing to him.\n\nHe\'s asked me to put eyeliner on him when we get the chance. ""Will baby help me look pretty?"" He asked and I got to tell him that he was already beautiful. I think my biggest issue is that I don\'t know when he wants to be treated like a girl and be held and called beautiful versus when he wants to be my protector and man. I\'ve never guessed wrong and beckoned him into my arms to be held when it wasn\'t the correct action but how many times have I not risked the guess and let him feel guilty for wanting the situation to be swapped while he held me? I don\'t want him to feel guilty for who he is anymore. What can I do? ', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Help me help him?', 'created': 1479059000.0}"

In the same vein, however, I've never completely felt like ""One of the girls"" either. Like, I can be around girls and actually feel more chill and at ease, but feel a lot of unease as well.

53,2016-11-30 18:57:11,5fredo,3,8,"A couple of years ago, a cousin of mine came out as trans MtF. It got me to thinking a lot about non-binary issues, and now I consider myself an ally of the LGBTQ* community and am trying to learn more. With that has come some questions about myself that I'm trying to understand. Generally speaking, I have considered myself a straight, white emotionally sensitive cis-male.

For years, I was always curious what it was like to wear women's underwear, pantyhose, bras, etc. I vaguely remember playing dress-up as a child, and as a teenager sneaking items from my sister's drawer on very rare occasions. When I was old enough to do so, I bought my own pair of thigh-highs and kept them hidden under my bed. I would wear them secretly at night under my jeans/socks. I would think about what it'd be like to wear other items, but I was always too afraid to buy them. I used to tuck myself between my legs to see what it would look like, and sometimes I would even use ""female"" techniques to touch myself and get off. At some point, I stopped thinking about those things for a while.

Then a couple of years ago, I found myself wanting to wear panties. I started wearing cotton panties because I liked how soft they felt compared to men's underwear, even if they didn't always support me properly. I also started wearing tights/pantyhose whenever it was cold outside. I liked how they made my legs feel.

About a week ago, my girlfriend was out of town and I found one of her bras laying around. In a moment of spontaneity, I tried it on as well as some of her other clothes. Her skinny jeans felt/looked amazing (and actually gave my nonexistant ass some shape). I liked how I looked with a shirt on over my ""new"" bra-induced curves. That was a pretty confusing moment for me. I'm not sure if it was because I felt sexy or what. I have since bought my own ""secret"" bra (36A) that I could wear under my regular clothes.

However, I have always considered myself as just a sensitive guy who is in touch with his anima or feminine side. That I'm ""emotionally feminine."" I find it hard to relate to machismo. Having said that, I used to practice self defense martial arts and I loved it - I felt very badass..empowered...""manly."" I sport a full beard. I used to have a ponytail, but I am balding and it didn't look so good so I shaved it all off. I like my ""manly appearance,"" and I don't hate my genitals or secondary sex traits. I generally identify as a male, who wants to be a better man (by moral/ethical standards) - but I also feel this feminine side begging to be acknowledged and related to by women (in the purest platonic sense).

I have noticed that at certain times of the year, I feel more ""in touch"" with my feminine side. Lately I have felt like crossdressing at home when nobody is around. I have wanted to go shopping for women's pants/jeans to see what fits and looks good. This time last year, I considered presenting myself online as a female version of myself (even came up with a name). I also did something similar when I was a teenager. 

So I'm mostly just confused. On the one hand, I never felt like I was assigned the wrong gender and I have no desire to rid myself of my facial/chest hair.

I also started wearing tights/pantyhose whenever it was cold outside. I liked how they made my legs feel.\n\nAbout a week ago, my girlfriend was out of town and I found one of her bras laying around. In a moment of spontaneity, I tried it on as well as some of her other clothes. Her skinny jeans felt/looked amazing (and actually gave my nonexistant ass some shape). I liked how I looked with a shirt on over my ""new"" bra-induced curves. That was a pretty confusing moment for me. I\'m not sure if it was because I felt sexy or what. I have since bought my own ""secret"" bra (36A) that I could wear under my regular clothes.\n\nHowever, I have always considered myself as just a sensitive guy who is in touch with his anima or feminine side. That I\'m ""emotionally feminine."" I find it hard to relate to machismo. Having said that, I used to practice self defense martial arts and I loved it - I felt very badass..empowered...""manly."" I sport a full beard. I used to have a ponytail, but I am balding and it didn\'t look so good so I shaved it all off. I like my ""manly appearance,"" and I don\'t hate my genitals or secondary sex traits. I generally identify as a male, who wants to be a better man (by moral/ethical standards) - but I also feel this feminine side begging to be acknowledged and related to by women (in the purest platonic sense).\n\nI have noticed that at certain times of the year, I feel more ""in touch"" with my feminine side. Lately I have felt like crossdressing at home when nobody is around. I have wanted to go shopping for women\'s pants/jeans to see what fits and looks good. This time last year, I considered presenting myself online as a female version of myself (even came up with a name). I also did something similar when I was a teenager. \n\nSo I\'m mostly just confused. On the one hand, I never felt like I was assigned the wrong gender and I have no desire to rid myself of my facial/chest hair. But on the other hand, I feel like exploring my femininity and connecting with other feminine people.', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Trying to understand myself...Am I genderfluid or something else?', 'created': 1480557431.0}"

53,2016-11-09 07:30:55,5bzgwy,9,93,"Good morning!

No doubt you have already read tonight's pending election results. It looks pretty rough. It's going to be a hard four years, but we can handle this. We always have. I've been pushing for equal rights for the past twelve or fourteen years or so, and despite how dark the horizon looks right now, we are going to outlast this, too.

This is a dark moment. I'm a North Carolinian; I knew this feeling when Amendment 1 and HB2 passed. But I'm still here. I'm still fighting. I'm going to be stubborn and I'm not giving up. Things are getting better, and we can't give up now. I won't. I *will* see things made better for those who come behind us. We're not just living for ourselves, we're living for the generations who will follow us.

We have a right to exist. We have a right to live our lives in peace and quiet. We've lived through Bush. We've lived through war, we've lived through hatred, we've lived through poverty, we've lived through bigotry. *We're still here.*  
We are bound together and we are never alone.

A gay, Greek poet, [Dinos Christianopoulos](http://jhfearless.com/2014/11/they-tried-to-bury-us-they-didnt-know-we-were-seeds/), once wrote, 'They tried to bury us. They didn't know we were seeds.' 

We're standing on one of those moments right now. We're dreaming for ourselves and we're dreaming for those who will come after us. They can't crush our dreams or our spirits, all they can do is delay our unstoppable progress. Take heart; we're playing the long game, and we're playing to win. We *are* going to win. We *are* going to build a better world.

Tonight isn't a stumbling block; tonight is a building block. We're going to rally our allies, we're going to use this pressure to work harder. We're going to learn, and we're going to improve. We're going to survive and we're going to outlast this hatred.

Look to your friends and loved ones for support. We are a family here. We have our differences from time to time, but we are each a piece of something much bigger than ourselves. Our lives intertwine and support each other, in the way that many tiny, bright threads make a beautiful tapestry.

As Churchill once said, 'If you're going through Hell, *keep going.*'
