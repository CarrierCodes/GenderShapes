I help run a new text/voice chat server called Transcord. I've noticed that in a lot of other previous support servers, there hasn't been much of an effort in reaching out to the Genderqueer/Non-Binary communities. I hope to change that with Transcord. We're a very open server, and welcome anyone that's trans, non-binary, questioning, or an ally. We feature private Non-Binary rooms and as a mod team are always open to suggestions and critique. Feel free to check us out if you'd like. Looking forward to seeing you folks!

 * I am attracted primarily to women.
 * I am most attracted to a woman who appears hyper-feminine.
 * I am on occasion physically attracted to men.
 * I am attracted to men who appear hyper-masculine
 * I have a very strong libido.
 * I am averse to other people's genitalia (male or female).
 * I reconcile the above mostly via softcore porn from the far reaches of Deviantart (there be dragons).
 * I do, however, enjoy the rest of a lover's body very much, staying on any one stage of foreplay as long as my lover wishes.
 * I am intensely romantic, with a laser-focused emotional tie to my lover, who is the center of my universe when we're together.
 * I will do absolutely anything my lover needs me to...even leave. No hard feelings. If it's over, it's over. Still friends with most of my exes.
 * The last couple I don't consider a mere dating pattern. This intense romantic focus is a part of my identity.
 * My lover has thus far always been female, but I don't discount male or nonbinary lovers as a possibility.
 * I am not comfortable filling a masculine role in society. Like, at all. You could go down a checklist of personality traits you might consider ""feminine,"" and most of them would apply to me.
 * In fact, just go down the left side of this list: http://41.media.tumblr.com/9d267b198014ba86600ea5c97f5ab8b6/tumblr_nbryumwdfQ1tfilauo1_1280.png
 * I prefer women who can check off the right side as much as possible.
 * I envy women's options in clothing, jewelry, makeup, etc. I wish there were distinctly male versions of such things available this century.
 * Despite the last few, I wish to be recognized and present as a man at all times, even if my social role is completely different. However, this is only in physical space.

17,2016-01-10 16:59:18,40c1re,11,4,"Hey friends. Lately I've been having some really painful and scary feelings of needing to transition. I'm 21 years old and currently male. Sorry in advance if some details in this wall of text are TMI. I'm trying to just get everything out of my head and into this post. I'd really appreciate it if you have the time to read it and help me out with some wisdom. Theres a tl;dr at the end because this is a huge post.
Sorry for the throwaway account. I'm sure you can guess why.  

**The story so far:**  


The earliest I remember feeling like I was in the wrong body was when I was 5 years old. I was in preschool and I remember trying to convince another boy that I was secretly a girl. I cringe at this memory but I guess it's kind of sweet depending on how you look at it. I also have memories of trying to invert my genitals at a very young age (like, push it inside my body). I didn't know why at the time, but I knew I wanted it to go inwards and be flat on the outside. I also remember having to explain to my mother why I picked female characters in Mario Kart, and quickly coming up with the excuse of 'I pick all of them equally'. Even at that age, I knew this was something I had to lie about. Lying about this became a big theme in my life from this point forward.   


Between then and the age of 13 (or so), I didn't spend much time thinking about my gender at all. I wasn't really aware that transgender was a real thing. At this point I was very awkward and occasionally got teased at school, but for some reason my confidence was still relatively high and I remained a fairly talkative, happy child.   

When I was 14 (or around then) my family went on a short holiday. I had my own room with it's own bathroom, and one night I found myself, in my newfound privacy, looking in the mirror, fantasising about waking up female the next day. I repeated this each night, imagining myself slowly becoming more female in a number of different fantastical circumstances. The thought excited me in that special way that you can feel in your chest. This was when I started to think seriously about why I wanted to be a girl so badly.  

Age 15. My research led me to a number of online resources and armed with this knowledge, I ended up coming out to my mother, who cried and tried to tell me it was a phase. I don't hold it against her at all. She told my dad, who, in her words, 'tried to act like it never happened'. When the gender psychologist she took me to said it was time to start thinking about HRT, she cut all ties with him, and I stopped seeing him. My mother and I had a really awkward argument about it and since then the topic has barely been discussed at all. I spent the next few years in and out of awkward phases as a result of never feeling comfortable in my own skin.  

When I was 18, I got a girlfriend and stopped thinking about it for a while. I tried to convince myself I would be able to just live my life as a male. In my head, I had a choice between my career and creative ambitions (which I was heavily focusing on), and transitioning. I chose the former, because transitioning seemed almost impossible. When I was 19, the feelings of wanting to become a woman were intensifying, but I doubled down on trying to ignore them and live a fulfilling life as a male. At this point, I knew I was female in my head, but thought I'd be able to find happiness without transitioning. My relationship ended for unrelated reasons, and I met a new girl, who continues to light up my life almost 3 years later.  

I'm now 21 now, and over the past few years, I've been withdrawing more and more into my comfort zone. I'm experiencing social anxiety to a stronger extent than I can ever remember, despite being happy with my friendships and my relationship. This is leading me to spend extended periods alone, often engaging in escapism through tv shows and video games. I feel really depressed lately, and often struggle to see any goodness or positivity in life. Sometimes I get consumed by a feeling of hopelessness. And I've never needed to be female more. The feeling of excitement I get when I think about transitioning is overwhelming. A few nights a week, I lock myself in my room and dress in some skirts and dresses I bought online. I actually wore some make-up for the first time tonight and loved what I saw. It feels amazing, but its so crushing knowing I can't leave my bedroom in these clothes without being humiliated.   

I love my girlfriend more than anything in the world. She supports me through my moodiness and depression to a huge extent. She has no knowledge of my gender issues, and I feel like she'd have a hard time with me transitioning. If I'm being honest, I expect she'd have to break up with me, because she's not romantically attracted to girls. One night however, we were watching a TV show about transgender people in the UK, and out of nowhere, she joked that if I decided to become a woman she'd still love me. I can't tell how serious she was being, and I don't want to be too hopeful. I have a feeling the reality of transitioning would be way more dramatic than either of us could imagine. This is the number one thing which stops me from transitioning. Maybe we could still be best friends afterwards? I hate thinking about living my life without her.  

So here I am, 21 years old, wishing I were female on the outside more than ever. And yet, the thought of becoming a transgirl scares me more than anything. I honestly think I have a pretty good shot at passing, as I have a feminine face and a slim physique, but if I were to transition and not pass I don't think I'd be able to handle it. I suppose I just really really wish I could be female without having to go through transitioning. I'm terrified of the social repercussions, and at my prospects of having the career I want if I were to transition. I don't know how my family would react. I'm really scared. If I were confident I could transition successfully and pass I'd do it in a heartbeat, but I just feel petrified with fear and unable to act. And with every month that passes, I feel like my chances of becoming a feminine woman get lower and lower.  


**tl;dr:** I really want to transition but don't want to lose the girl I love and am terrified of the social repercussions of being trans. Passing is really important to me and I'm scared that I won't be satisfied with my femininity.

Lately I've been having some really painful and scary feelings of needing to transition. I'm 21 years old and currently male. Sorry in advance if some details in this wall of text are TMI. I'm trying to just get everything out of my head and into this post. I'd really appreciate it if you have the time to read it and help me out with some wisdom. Theres a tl;dr at the end because this is a huge post.\nSorry for the throwaway account. I'm sure you can guess why.  \n\n**The story so far:**  \n\n\nThe earliest I remember feeling like I was in the wrong body was when I was 5 years old. I was in preschool and I remember trying to convince another boy that I was secretly a girl. I cringe at this memory but I guess it's kind of sweet depending on how you look at it. I also have memories of trying to invert my genitals at a very young age (like, push it inside my body). I didn't know why at the time, but I knew I wanted it to go inwards and be flat on the outside. I also remember having to explain to my mother why I picked female characters in Mario Kart, and quickly coming up with the excuse of 'I pick all of them equally'. Even at that age, I knew this was something I had to lie about. Lying about this became a big theme in my life from this point forward.   \n\n\nBetween then and the age of 13 (or so), I didn't spend much time thinking about my gender at all. I wasn't really aware that transgender was a real thing. At this point I was very awkward and occasionally got teased at school, but for some reason my confidence was still relatively high and I remained a fairly talkative, happy child.   \n\nWhen I was 14 (or around then) my family went on a short holiday. I had my own room with it's own bathroom, and one night I found myself, in my newfound privacy, looking in the mirror, fantasising about waking up female the next day. I repeated this each night, imagining myself slowly becoming more female in a number of different fantastical circumstances. The thought excited me in that special way that you can feel in your chest. This was when I started to think seriously about why I wanted to be a girl so badly.  \n\nAge 15. My research led me to a number of online resources and armed with this knowledge, I ended up coming out to my mother, who cried and tried to tell me it was a phase. I don't hold it against her at all. She told my dad, who, in her words, 'tried to act like it never happened'. When the gender psychologist she took me to said it was time to start thinking about HRT, she cut all ties with him, and I stopped seeing him. My mother and I had a really awkward argument about it and since then the topic has barely been discussed at all. I spent the next few years in and out of awkward phases as a result of never feeling comfortable in my own skin.  \n\nWhen I was 18, I got a girlfriend and stopped thinking about it for a while. I tried to convince myself I would be able to just live my life as a male. In my head, I had a choice between my career and creative ambitions (which I was heavily focusing on), and transitioning. I chose the former, because transitioning seemed almost impossible. When I was 19, the feelings of wanting to become a woman were intensifying, but I doubled down on trying to ignore them and live a fulfilling life as a male. At this point, I knew I was female in my head, but thought I'd be able to find happiness without transitioning. My relationship ended for unrelated reasons, and I met a new girl, who continues to light up my life almost 3 years later.  \n\nI'm now 21 now, and over the past few years, I've been withdrawing more and more into my comfort zone. I'm experiencing social anxiety to a stronger extent than I can ever remember, despite being happy with my friendships and my relationship. This is leading me to spend extended periods alone, often engaging in escapism through tv shows and video games. I feel really depressed lately, and often struggle to see any goodness or positivity in life. Sometimes I get consumed by a feeling of hopelessness. And I've never needed to be female more.

""Hi,

I was expecting this to happen at some point, but when it didn't for months I was, stupidly, optimistic. I thought maybe your service had loosened it's archaic naming rules, but alas, no. Let me clue you in here, though I am almost sure you know exactly what is happening. I am a trans woman. For the less educated among you, that means I do not identify as the gender assigned to me at birth, and identify as a woman. I actually used Facebook to announce this publicly, when I first decided to do so, on the 28th of June, 2015. I was impressed, then, at how simple it was to change your name and pronouns on Facebook, to those that you prefer. It was then, that I changed my name on Facebook from Jack James Harley, my birth name, to Jacqueline Jade Blackburn, my prefered name. That is the name I use in my everyday life and that is the only name I have had for 7 months. I find it amazing, then, to be contacted asking to prove my identity. Like there is some kind of fakery, or trickery, going on. As if I am somehow lying to the world. I not only find this abhorrent and rude, but would class it as downright discrimination. You say it is necessary, in order for people to connect with me on Facebook. I find this excuse ludicrous, for I have had no problem connecting with people on Facebook for the last 7 months, nor has anyone had problems connecting with me. From family I have not seen in years to people I barely meet at parties, connecting with people has been no more difficult now than ever. You are not asking me for identification to help people connect with me. You are asking for my identity as a personal attack upon my identity. That is how it feels, at the very least. 

""When we discover accounts that look fake or like they’re using fake information, we ask the owner to confirm they are who they say they are.""

I am very curious about this line specifically, taken from your ""Help Centre"" (very helpful). When you discover accounts that look fake, or like they are using fake information? How do you discover these accounts? What constitutes an account ""looking fake""? It all seems very suspicious to me. I believe that you reported my account because you know, as everyone does, that the name I use is not my legal name, and the gender I use is not my legal gender, yet.

You have no right to demand that of me, and you shall get no such pleasure from me. You want to deactivate my account because I am a trans young person, trying as we all are to fight so many barriers just to be ourselves? You go right ahead.

33,2016-01-21 06:09:50,41yn6x,10,19,"I've been with my girlfriend for 4 years. In all that time, we loved and supported each other without fail, and always communicated our issues without fighting. We've helped each other grow, we've seen each other through struggle, we've shared moments of immense joy, and we've had what could be said to be a fairytale relationship for all of 4 years.

Except, I'm a woman. And she's not a lesbian. And there's nothing either of us can do about either of those things.

We've been long distance for our entire relationship (PA/CA) and only saw each other for a week or so at a time every few months. Still, the time we spent together was incomparable happiness, and even when apart we skyped almost every night for hours.

Last August, I came to terms with 10 years of feelings and began to seriously consider that I might be a woman. I told her that night, and I was met with a lot of discomfort. She supported me, but even though she was interested in women sexually, she was never interested in a relationship with one. She said if I transitioned, we probably wouldn't stay together. After a few hours of placating her and convincing her she was more important to me than that, she was okay.

I convinced her that I was genderfluid, that I still valued my male identity. Over the next few months, I experimented in my free time, dressing up, exploring my true self. I occasionally sent her pictures, and got sometimes enthusiastic responses. But I never knew how she would feel when I sent her something. She would sometimes get upset, and I would try to say that it would feel different in person.

Eventually I got my chance, when I spent 10 days with her the week of Thanksgiving. Towards the end of my trip, I dressed up with her one night. I wore my wig and a tshirt with a pair of leggings, and she did my makeup. I was happy. We were happy. We took pictures together. When I asked if it felt different in person, she said yes.

After I returned, I didn't dress up again for a while. I grew my beard out again so that nobody would be suspicious when I went home for my school's Christmas break. Over those 3 weeks, it killed me having to stay in my mom's one room apartment without being able to tell her. My girlfriend helped me deal with those feelings, and again everything seemed great. She was so supportive, and really helped me deal with what I was feeling.

After I came back to school, I shaved all my body hair, and bought a dress and heels. It made me feel so right. This past Sunday, I dressed up and sent her pictures again. Since then, she's been distant. Last night, when we skyped, I got the dreaded ""we need to talk."" We talked, and I finally fessed up. I'm a woman. It's plain as day. I can't do anything about that. After a lot of talking and a lot of crying, the 4 best years of my life ended, in the blink of an eye.

What hurts the most is that both of us still desperately want to be together. There's nothing I can do about how I feel, and there's nothing she can do about how she feels. It's nobody's fault. But it hurts. It hurts so much. I don't know if we'll ever stop loving each other, but it just can't go on.

I know this is best for me in the long term. My exploration of my identity now only has to make me happy and nobody else, and I know that's the only way I can truly be who I am. I just wish it didn't have to be this way.

Maybe somewhere down the line, we can be together again post transition; I think the hardest thing for her was seeing the person she fell in love with slowly go away. But, I'm not holding my breath.

In all that time, we loved and supported each other without fail, and always communicated our issues without fighting. We\'ve helped each other grow, we\'ve seen each other through struggle, we\'ve shared moments of immense joy, and we\'ve had what could be said to be a fairytale relationship for all of 4 years.\n\nExcept, I\'m a woman. And she\'s not a lesbian. And there\'s nothing either of us can do about either of those things.\n\nWe\'ve been long distance for our entire relationship (PA/CA) and only saw each other for a week or so at a time every few months. Still, the time we spent together was incomparable happiness, and even when apart we skyped almost every night for hours.\n\nLast August, I came to terms with 10 years of feelings and began to seriously consider that I might be a woman. I told her that night, and I was met with a lot of discomfort. She supported me, but even though she was interested in women sexually, she was never interested in a relationship with one. She said if I transitioned, we probably wouldn\'t stay together. After a few hours of placating her and convincing her she was more important to me than that, she was okay.\n\nI convinced her that I was genderfluid, that I still valued my male identity.

I am afab and I absolutely *love* most things stereotypically ""girly"", which means that I fit almost perfectly into the ""female"" stereotype. In one way it'd be so easy to pretend to be cis and live like that. But I have *a lot* of social dysphoria, so that's not really an option for me. And I'm really scared of coming out, so to see if it would help with the dysphoria, I wore neutral clothes for a few months. In one way dressing neutrally helped, because people no longer said things like ""you're such a tiny and cute little girl!"", and they stopped acting protective and flirty (this is really the part I hate most. When people act as if I'm this fragile little creature that needs protection). But I felt miserable, because I missed being able to dress the way I like to. I mean, my favourite color is pink, and I love glitter and makeup etc, so looking the way I'd like to, more or less guarantees that people will say that I'm tiny and cute, and I'm *really* not comfortable with that. I've at least come to the solution that I shouldn't force myself to look more neutral, because that's just not who I am.

So my issue now is that I don't know what do to about this. I need to lessen the social dysphoria, so the options I can see so far are: 

1: Living with my dysphoria and pretending to be cis (I've been doing this for the last 8 months - so far it's not been working very well. And the thought of continuing to do this makes it feel like my stomach is sinking down into a bottomless pit)

2: Coming out and having to deal with the doubts and questions that would inevitably follow. But I'm really scared of coming out, because most people I know don't think non binary gender identities are a real thing, and that it's just a phase. And knowing that they feel that way makes me worried that they wouldn't take me seriously at all, because on top of not thinking NB people are real, they'd see my twirly skirts and make up and think that I've gone mad.

Ugh, this is really draining me of energy, so if anyone has had a similar experience, I'd love to hear how you solved it, because this is really starting to get to me.

I need to lessen the social dysphoria, so the options I can see so far are: \n\n1: Living with my dysphoria and pretending to be cis (I\'ve been doing this for the last 8 months - so far it\'s not been working very well. And the thought of continuing to do this makes it feel like my stomach is sinking down into a bottomless pit)\n\n2: Coming out and having to deal with the doubts and questions that would inevitably follow. But I\'m really scared of coming out, because most people I know don\'t think non binary gender identities are a real thing, and that it\'s just a phase. And knowing that they feel that way makes me worried that they wouldn\'t take me seriously at all, because on top of not thinking NB people are real, they\'d see my twirly skirts and make up and think that I\'ve gone mad.\n\nUgh, this is really draining me of energy, so if anyone has had a similar experience, I\'d love to hear how you solved it, because this is really starting to get to me.\nThanks for taking your time to read! :)', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Advice on dealing with these kinds of thoughts?

3,2016-01-02 06:23:29,3z4177,2,10,"Hi, so I'm FAAB, but I've always had a relatively deep voice for a lady, have always disliked how I look, and had a few detractors all through secondary school who teased me for my massive chin and how I ""look like a man"". I probably don't have that big of a chin and have quite a few friends who say so if this is ever mentioned, but it still feels big to me, and the way my larynx sits, I have less definition at the bottom than I'd like. 
I also don't think I have a particularly feminine body shape - I'm more than a little bit chubby at 14st and 5'7"" and my boobs are tiny, so the chub on my stomach sticks out far enough that on bloated days I either look a few months pregnant or like a man with moobs and a beer gut, depending on what my self-esteem levels are like that day. 
I also take after my dad in the face more than my mum, and my brother took after my mum more, and it's always bugged me that he's always been ~prettier~ than me. (I mean, he doesn't need it, right? There's a larger margin for men's looks than women's in terms of what is deemed attractive imo.) Although I have quite nice legs, and on good days I can actually like my face a bit and maybe feel a bit better about my broad shoulders, that's about it - everything between my shoulders and hips is a fucking disaster zone.
Also, I'm not very good at putting on makeup; although I've found a good lip colour and have found a way of doing my eyeliner that I actually like, eye makeup takes ages and doesn't feel worth the effort half the time. And my skin is such that even when I think I've exfoliated and moisturised enough, I can't put on foundation in my T zone without looking part lizard.

I'm currently toying with the idea that I might be genderqueer, because some days the idea of binding and wearing masculine clothing really appeals to me, but then some days I look back on it and feel like it might be false bravado, like I had that one summer where I grew out my leg hair and wore shorts the whole time (and pretended I was okay with it, but eventually realised it made me intensely unhappy sometimes not only because I looked unfeminine and disgusting, but also I was aware of the potential summer romances I was missing out on by alienating potential love interests with my manly manly legs.) Some days the idea of dressing up and presenting as male kind of makes me feel sick. But then maybe that's what it is to be genderqueer: to have those days where you present as female because presenting masculinely doesn't appeal to you at all. But I don't know for sure.
I want to join a gym as soon as I can and start weight training so I can at least be a tough muscly androgynous being instead of the ugly genderless blob I currently am, but I'm worried I'll just look uber-masculine then (despite absence of paunch and extra bit of chestiness that having pec muscles would give me) which I guess I'll just have to contend with, as currently being chubby is probably making me more dysphoric than being muscly would make me. Especially since I'll probably be able to fit into more clothes that I actually think look good on me. But I can't know for sure.

Basically, I'm not sure if I'm genderqueer or just thinking of compensating for looking unfeminine by trying to be masculine on my own terms, instead of by accident and then trying too hard to look feminine on days when sometimes my self-esteem is so low that I can't focus enough and so just can't be fucked with the effort involved in that. I feel like maybe it's the kind of thing where I could just be ashamed of the idea of being masculine because I used to get teased for it, so maybe if I present more often as masculine and get comfortable with the idea then I could actually enjoy it?
Also, I know it's stupid, but I'm worried that presenting as masculine here and there is going to put off potential romantic interests, and I don't know if that would be exclusively gynosexuals either - what if bi-/polysexuals are put off by my changing and switching around? For example, I identify as pansexual, but I feel like I could be more attracted to men sometimes while just admiring females from afar but not seeing them as dateable (although this could be due to my daddy issues making me want more male attention and the worry that all women I'm attracted to could almost invariably do better than me, so why should I bother pursuing any crushes on that part of the continuum?)

So yeah. I'm a mess. Would appreciate any advice.

P.S. I currently have long hair, which I love and so don't feel too conflicted about. I'm considering shaving the sides so it'd be easier to style in more masculine ways.

This worries me because I am not sure if I have a crossdressing fetish or I am actually transgender. Eventually I began having non sexual thoughts about being a woman. These thoughts included myself overall feeling happier, enjoying nature more, and being a nicer person. As a male, I do not experience much body dysphoria. I do however recognize that this is not necessary to be trans. What I have is body euphoria. I would feel much happier in a female body. From this I concluded that my dysphoria is that my body is preventing me from achieving euphoria although I do not hate my body. Another thing that has been bothering me is that these feeling are very recent. Most trans people say ""I always new something was different"" or ""I played with girls toys when I was a child"". I have none of these things. Looking back, in the first grade I declared I was a girl to my classmates, but these feelings were brief and I probably did this for attention. Other than that, I played with boys toys and never ""knew I was different"". These feeling didn't even start when I started puberty, so im really concerned they are not genuine or that I am faking it. Although it started sexually, I am trying to act more female day by day and am hinted my family and friends. I am worried this is from my hormones and is just sexual because of my little dysphoria.

I am not saying that it is disrespectful to change your name, as it is perfectly reasonable in many situations.

I'm just curious as to what my long term sexual function could be expected to be.

Impotence is something that worries me especially because I have a partner. 

I'm not sure if my failure to perform in the past was a worry that I wouldn't be able to or a lack of libido or both.

Both have pros and cons to me unfortunately :( so I'm just trying to work out what is the best path for me to take.

Well tonight, I mentioned to my mom about how I need to schedule a few doctor's appointments next week--physical therapy to help me get back into the swing of things after an appendectomy almost a month ago, a gyno appointment to sort out the endometriosis/PCOS/not-yet-diagnosed issue with my junk, and a consult with a surgeon for top surgery.  First two, mom was chill.  Last one mom flipped out and ended up asking me how I was planning to pay for top surgery.  I said that I assumed that she and my dad would help me pay for it beyond what insurance covers (which will still probably be around 2-3 grand because our current policy is kind of the worst), since they've been helping me cover all other healthcare bills (and didn't even suggest that I need to pay the bills from the appendectomy).

And the worst part is that the whole time my mom was like ""I just want to understand you"" and ""I support you"".  But like words mean things.  You can't just say them and then do the exact opposite and assume what you said is the truth.

Over the last [insert timeframe here], I have been in the process of updating my wardrobe in an attempt to reduce the amount of masculinity I project. Between that and also playing around with eyeliner &amp; nail polish, I don't think I'm doing a bad job (we'll conveniently ignore the shoddy excuse for a beard I'm currently sporting).

However, I am still somewhat limited in what I can find. I don't really do fancy patterns or predominant bright/bold colours for one. I'm also only looking in the menswear section - I don't feel comfortable even looking in the womens' section, let alone trying to find out if there would be anything there I like that would actually suit me (a tall ask, imo), and that would be tenfold for the idea of actually wearing anything in public that may be readily identified as such.

Despite the above, I have been able to get somewhere with:

- More form-fitting clothing (mostly through buying a smaller size)
- Skinnier jeans (easy to find, really)
- Different necklines (e.g. cowl-neck)
- Longline cuts

However, I feel like I need to expand my horizons, and was wondering anyone has anything to suggest for the following:

- Good stores/locations/websites to shop for androgynous men's clothing **in the UK**. I get bored looking in H&amp;M, Zara, River Island, etc, for the one or two lines they sell that might be what I'm looking for.
- Anything, perhaps, that might be typically designed for women, or at least designated as such by the retailer, but I could wear as a 6' male and look androgynous as opposed to a cross-dresser.

I would love it if anyone had any ideas.

Background: Hi, Im 17 years old and have been having transgender feelings for about 4 months now. I have a TON of self doubt because I don't feel too dysphoric and these feeling are new. Also for the past couple days i've been feeling more manly. (I think this is because I am this way around girls that I like).
Coming Out: (all of this just happened) Anyways I digress. So today when I finished exams I went home and told my mother I was going to get some new shoes. She asked me which shoes and I said pink converse high tops. The only reason I really wanted these was to hint my mother. Either way they were nice shoes and I needed new ones. She told me I couldn't get them because my father might get pissed at her for buying them. (He is gone for business now.) Overall she didn't seem too put off. She just made jokes later like ""come here, check out this pink thing"". Later in the night my sister was complaining to her about me wanting the shoes (she thinks ill ruin her ""image""). So we were all talking and my mother said ""not that there is anything wrong with this but, people might see those shoes as gay. I nervously said ""I'm not gay"". Next she said ""your not a Caitlyn are you"" while laughing. I laughed nervously and drank water to pretend I wasn't talking. She said ""you don't want to change your gender or have surgery for boobs haha"". I said I don't want any surgeries and said ""I have to go upstairs and study"". My sister was mortified. My mother was kind of chuckling nervously. I went to my room and studied. I was shaking. Five minutes later she came in and said ""I know you just like those shoes because you like them. I said I like them and they are cool. She said, ""you want to change your gender and have surgery"" (she obviously has no idea what hormones are). I giggled nervously saying ""you got it"". She kept asking me things and I said ""I have to study"" She softly said ""you can talk to me"" and stuff. I said I know and she said ""if you are having these feelings we can take you to someone to help you"". Not sure if gender therapist or conversion type of therapist. Anyways It just kinda ended on her not really being completely sure of anything and her leaving saying she loves me.
I have no idea what to do if this is brought up again. She has always said its ok if I'm gay but this is different. Hopefully she will do some research before talking to me again. I just want acceptance until I figure myself out. Please advise?

So today when I finished exams I went home and told my mother I was going to get some new shoes. She asked me which shoes and I said pink converse high tops. The only reason I really wanted these was to hint my mother. Either way they were nice shoes and I needed new ones. She told me I couldn\'t get them because my father might get pissed at her for buying them. (He is gone for business now.) Overall she didn\'t seem too put off. She just made jokes later like ""come here, check out this pink thing"". Later in the night my sister was complaining to her about me wanting the shoes (she thinks ill ruin her ""image"").

I'm some variety of genderqueer human (androgyne/neutral/bigender/whatever) and I'm starting low dose and/or short-term testosterone in a couple of weeks. I'm trying to move towards a body which is more androgynous, a bit more both/neither, and which gives me more options for how I can move in the world. At the moment the world perceives me as a feminine woman but I would feel much more comfortable being perceived as a femme man or a masculine woman or a kinda-boy-kinda-girl person. I'm mostly looking forward to my voice dropping and being able to put on more upper body mass, as well as some body fat moving away from my hips/thighs (although those babies are just always going to be big-ish). I'm not looking forward to growing body or facial hair and will likely get that lasered. I'm hoping I can find the sweet spot of a genderedly ambiguous/neutral body which allows me some versatility in presentation.

Mostly I'm interested in whether anyone else (AFAB or AMAB) presents in an ambiguous or neutral way, especially (but not necessariyl) as a result of HRT? What that has been like for you? I know lots of non-binary people who go on HRT but that mostly seems to be because they identify a bit more with the 'other' end of the spectrum and would prefer to be perceived that way. But I don't want to be forced into the 'man' category just because I'm using T, ya know?

I'm wondering if what I'm trying to do is realistically achievable? And is the aggressively gendered nature of society going to make it impossible to live this way? I think friends and family will be mostly accepting (if a little dismissive) and I live in a very LBGT-friendly area of the my city, so I'm hoping it will be okay but am wondering if I'm being a little naive?

85,2016-01-16 18:36:19,419led,3,40,"I social dance regularly, blues and swing. I've also been growing out my hair, and it's in a zone that it looks a little androgynous, in that if I'm wearing men's clothes it looks like a male haircut but if I'm wearing a dress it can look more feminine.

I wore a dress to a dance last night, and I had several things happen for the first time:

* Someone got confused about my gender when he met me, and then asked me how I like people to refer to me. I found this funny and also flattering and it left me feeling empowered.
* I went to go to the restroom, and someone pointed me towards the women's room. This *really* surprised me, I had assumed most people would perceive me as ""guy wearing a dress"" and I wasn't expecting this. I found it sort of exciting and flattering.
* I met someone who recognized me from another dance scene, and he was like: ""You look familiar...I was like, I think I recognize them, they dance in Baltimore.""

I actually cried after that last conversation because it was the first time anyone I don't know has ever correctly guessed/used my desired pronouns.

More though than all these interactions, I noticed a lot of changes in how people interacted with me. The changes were not subtle--they were very overt, and were repeated in interactions with multiple strangers.  It was particularly noticeable because I hadn't been to this particular scene in months, so the last times I was here I had been dressing in all men's clothing.  Some of the changes I noticed:

* When I'd ask women to dance, a lot of the time, they'd say: ""I don't know how to lead, can you lead?"" -- I have *never* had people ask me this before, people just assume that I can lead and start dancing the follow role. This was totally new. One woman I danced with, a little bit into the dance, remarked: ""Wow, you're actually a good lead!"" with a tone of surprise in her voice. I have *never* had anyone remark anything like this...people are sometimes like ""Wow, you're a good lead!"" but it's not...like ""I'm surprised that you are actually good at leading."" Even if there's perhaps a sexist assumption in there that I dislike, I still found it oddly validating to hear a remark like this because I think it showed I was being perceived differently on the gender spectrum.
* Women turned me down to dance a lot more. I actually think this is a good thing, because I don't want to dance with someone if they're kinda ambivalent about dancing with me.  I've heard radical feminist ideology talking about how socialization in our society leads to women being likely to say ""yes"" to things they don't actually want, when men ask, more often than  they are likely to do the same when women ask.  I don't know if this was going on, but I noticed that of the people I danced with, all of the people seemed really into the dances, and I had better dances on average than I usually have, and that would seem to support my theory. Alternatively, it could just be transmisogyny (""oh no, it's a guy in a dress, how creepy!"") but if this is the motivator, I think it's still good these people are turning me down because I don't really want to be surrounded by that.
* I felt more like myself and more empowered, and I had more fun. A lot of the anxiety I often feel in social situations like that was completely absent. I think a large portion of the anxiety has actually been caused by a mismatch between how people perceive me and interact with me, and how I want to be perceived. For example, the prospect of people continuing to talk to me, or saying yes to a dance, when they don't want to, is something I find terrifying, and I find in social settings I often have to expend a lot of energy to check these sorts of things. I find that, at least this night, I spent a lot less time worrying about this sort of thing, and this freed up more mental energy for connecting with people the way I wanted to. 
* I danced both parts a lot and I had amazing dances both in lead and follow roles and felt super comfy in both roles. Women also asked me to dance a lot more!

In the end, the whole experience reinforced that I'm able to step outside the gender associated with my assigned birth sex, and that by doing so, I change how people interact with me, and that in doing so, I not only become better able to live the life I want to live, but I am gaining unique and deep insights from experiencing ""both sides"" of social interactions.

I went to one of our on campus doctors at my school, and after confirming that I was certain it was what I wanted and that I was also seeing a therapist, she looked at options with me and went ahead and wrote me a prescription! :D I was super surprised because I expected gatekeeping, but she just said, ""Why would I presume to know you better than you know yourself?""

But being NB transmasc, I have a few concerns that just won't stop bugging me. I definitely want a more masculine body and face and voice, but I'm dreading facial hair and clitoral enlargement. I'm agender, so basically my ultimate goal is to look as stereotypically androgynous as possible.

I'm not concerned about the pain aspect or anything, but have any of you tried something similar? It seems like it works well for cis women, but idk...
* How long were/are you on T? I know I'd stop doing birth control while on T, but like... if I reach a point of androgyny, can I stop T and keep the look? Or will I revert back to my estrogen look..? 
* Were/are you able to train your voice as it changes? I love singing, but I've heard a lot of trans guys say their singing voices are ruined forever....

After getting advice on this reddit few weeks ago I've looked into counselling in my area, turns out my university provides it. I've filled in a contact form and was put on the waiting list. Yesterday I got an email informing me that appointments are now available and I should come to the reception to arrange one for next week.

I should note that the initial form, later emails or the people at reception desk never asked me what is the issue I want help with.

The receptionist handed me a patient form, which had only my name on it, and ask me to fill in rest of the details, but as she handed me the form, she circled ""male"" next to the gender field. The form only had 2 options (which is it's own problem, why not just have an empty box?), and of the two I do feel male does describe me more, but I think if I'm asked to fill in a form, it should be me who does it. It was awkward and I guess one of the first times I have consciously realized what being missgenederd feels like (I was not aware of the term, and identified as male until few months ago).

What felt even worse was that while the receptionist was arranging an appointment for me, another person entered the room, and the receptionist addressed them ""I will be with you as soon as I finish with this gentleman"". The form was one thing, but she could use any number of other terms, I was a patient, a client, a student, a person. I used to like the term ""gentleman"", it made me feel grown up, but today it felt distant, made me switch off and be distracted. 

I still went through and made the appointment (next monday, yay!), and I can't blame the people working reception for not knowing about issues the specialists are meant to deal with, but at the same time I feel someone at some point should have asked me what is the issue I come with and be sensitive to it.

I just felt like I needed to share this experience, to went the anger it created. But if you do have suggestions how to deal with/avoid those situations in the future I welcome those.

I was recently on HRT, low E and T for a female. I decided to drop back to just T-blockers a few weeks ago however because I was having some doubts. Anxiety around having breasts and having them fondled (which wasn't expected, could have been some other factor that gave me anxiety when I was reminded I was growing them?). Where this anxiety came from I'm not sure.

I was also afraid of being female bodied or feminine in appearance socially. I guess this is just something that bothers me because I'm not binary at all. There have been times where I've presented as female in small gatherings before and I really did enjoy it, but my personality never changes (I am considered pretty feminine I suppose already) and I don't bother with my voice. That is how I'm comfortable. I guess I never really learnt to adjust my voice because I'm comfortable with it as is, and I love to sing as is. 

Only problem is it (my voice) isn't exactly feminine, my behaviour isn't 'strictly' feminine either. So I figured that I'd drop back my HRT to prevent transitioning into a territory where I'd need to socially present more in such a way to fit into the 'woman' gender box. 

But here I am, after having dropped back to just T-blockers and I find myself some days struggling to accept my decision (or lack there-of). I look in the mirror and wish I were moving toward a more feminine appearance and it pains me because while I want to look a certain way I don't want to be forced to act a certain way. Also I'm afraid of losing sexual function. Something that was very hit and miss on E. 

I was hoping that I could keep my T relatively low and present as an androgynous male and that would be enough, but I'm not so sure anymore. Maybe this will pass, but I don't know. I want to be okay with myself, but I keep looking down at my body today and I'm not happy, I keep imagining being female bodied. 

Whether this is just one of those days that will pass, I don't know but it is seriously distressing, and it's not exactly infrequent. 

I'm trying to just accept where I'm at, but it's not working the way I'd hoped. I'm starting to think my desire to transition is more driven internally, whereas what keeps stopping my transition is more fear of external consequence. 

But this is doing my head in. Sorry if this rant doesn't make a lot of sense. Thanks for getting this far if you are still here and lending an ear.

I've been on this birth control for... About 8-9 years? (I can't do math with this headache...) and when I saw him in may to talk about it, I had asked him if I could take it continuously. My period cramps are hella bad (I'm talking can't move for at least a day) and my period causes me dysphoria since I want nothing to do with my uterus, but he wouldn't do a hysterectomy for at least 10 years. I identify as two-spirit, and hve thought long and hard for about 10 years now about how I don't want to have my own kids, a decision that got set it stone about 4 years ago when I was diagnose with celiac disease.

I liked to play like a boy, dress like a boy, my dad called me ""son"" just as a joke but I took it to heart. I had a tendency to never want to wear a shirt because my boy friends didn't, and people were just people, so why couldn't I do the same. It always bugged me when people told me I had to be a certain way because I was a girl. More than that, I felt more like a boy than like a girl, but I never had any body dysphoria. A counselor would have probably called it gender identity disorder, if my parents thought I needed one. Luckily, they just figured I was a tomboy and hat I'd grow out of it.

Moving toward middle school I started being less concerned about gender. I realized I liked girls as well as guys when I was about 13, but because of my religious upbringing, I suppressed the realization that I am bi/Pansexual until I was 19, married to a man, and no longer religious. I still never liked ""girly"" things like shopping, shoes, and makeup, but I had long hair, wore female clothing, and presented as a typical girl. 

Within the last year, my masculine side really started coming out again. I could no longer stand to wear feminine clothes. I cut off my long hair into a short boyish haircut, and stopped wearing what little makeup I used to wear. For a few weeks, I was really afraid I was trans and that my life was going to turn upside down. I spent many a tearful night worrying that I was going to have to decide between telling my straight husband I am a man, and tearing the relationship apart, or keeping it to myself and making my life one I don't want to live. Thankfully, after some research and some self-reflection, I realized that I am not FtM. I am just me. I don't hate my body, and I don't want a new one. I could do without boobs, take them or leave them, and I would really love to have a penis if that was possible, but I also really love my vagina and wouldn't want to get rid of it. I have slight dysphoria about being called a ""lady"" or other feminine names, but I don't really feel like a man. I was in the shower, pondering under the hot water when I realized, I will always be exactly who I am, and nothing about me would change if I had a penis. Gender is a mostly meaningless concept that, if we remove the parts that were arbitrarily compartmentalized by society, there isn't much to as a whole. I like what I like, I dress how I dress, and I speak how I speak. That doesn't make me less of a girl and it doesn't mean I need to change. The fact that I don't want to change also doesn't mean I'm not a guy. I just don't want to be either, and yet, I'm both.

So now when someone asks if I'm a guy or a girl (which happens more often than you'd expect), my preferred answer is ""yeah, I guess"". Because I don't really know what those words mean and what they expect will change based on the answer, and I'm tired of having to choose one and try to fit into the description. I'm just a human. 

Added bonus to my realization. I explained all this to my husband, a straight cis guy. I thought he wouldn't understand and possibly be disgusted and not want me anymore. Instead, when I explained that I'm not ""just a girl, I'm kind of a guy too"" he just said, ""well duh honey, anybody who knows you could tell that."" And then he told me he wishes he could be more open like me and be sexually attracted to anyone regardless of their genitals but he's just straight, and that he'd still love me if I had a penis, even if we couldn't have sex anymore.

Last year I came out to my parents as genderqueer. My dad was pretty reasonable and basically told me ""you will always be my daughter"". Okay, fair enough. I don't mind that because I don't care about pronouns, so people can call me he/she/they or what seems easy for them. Anyways, my mom's response was many laughs followed by ""you know the more you try to search for yourself, the more you lose yourself"". I was pretty upset with my mom's response and that kind of created a landslide in my former close relationship with her, she was always more accepting of people's differences in the past but lately she's gone full Trump mentality and purposefully misgenders my FtM friend...which yeah, that is not cool. 

Anyways, since then I have been really closeted about it. I really like to wear my binder and dress masculine but I can never fully pass for male and whenever my boyfriend asks questions I just tell him that I'm a tomboy, since he laughs at the idea of being genderqueer. I think he's more leaning towards the whole idea that its just a label and in reality I can do whatever I want without having to label or explain myself. Which is a fair way to look at it, I suppose. I don't know...the whole thing for me is kind of new and I didn't even realize there was a word for how I felt about my gender until last year. Only two of my friends know my identity (mainly because they both came out to me as genderfluid and gender neutral, I'm a pretty easy person to talk to) and sweeping it under the rug around my boyfriend is getting uncomfortable for me. I know he told me that I can do whatever and not have to label or explain myself, but I just want to clear the air...because while I am fine with having a biologically female body and fine with not getting any top surgery or going on hormones, I still have issues with people using my birth name. I really fucking hate my birth name and I want more people to call me by my chosen name, which more people are doing without question because my chosen name is a gender neutral one (sneaky sneaky), but its...caused a bit of eyebrow raise from the boyfriend. Don't get me wrong, he's an absolute sweetheart and we go out of our way for each other a lot, he's just a little confused. Anyways, someone walked in once and used my chosen name and he just kinda looked at me like ""what"" out of sheer confusion. Reluctantly I told him that it was a name I went by and if it made it easy, he could just use my birth name. He's the only person outside of my parents who uses my birth name and its not a big deal...but at the same time it still feels off. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want to feel more valid...like I don't have to hide anything and that this could be perceived as ""normal"" by the people I love. I just want to be comfortable with myself around others but I'm scared of being rejected. Does anybody know the best way to come out without there being an eruption of disappointment from my loved ones? I know you people must get these kinds of questions a lot and there may not be an easy solution but I'm not sure where else to turn. I don't know many people personally who have also been through this dilemma.

I really like to wear my binder and dress masculine but I can never fully pass for male and whenever my boyfriend asks questions I just tell him that I\'m a tomboy, since he laughs at the idea of being genderqueer. I think he\'s more leaning towards the whole idea that its just a label and in reality I can do whatever I want without having to label or explain myself. Which is a fair way to look at it, I suppose. I don\'t know...the whole thing for me is kind of new and I didn\'t even realize there was a word for how I felt about my gender until last year. Only two of my friends know my identity (mainly because they both came out to me as genderfluid and gender neutral, I\'m a pretty easy person to talk to) and sweeping it under the rug around my boyfriend is getting uncomfortable for me. I know he told me that I can do whatever and not have to label or explain myself, but I just want to clear the air...because while I am fine with having a biologically female body and fine with not getting any top surgery or going on hormones, I still have issues with people using my birth name. I really fucking hate my birth name and I want more people to call me by my chosen name, which more people are doing without question because my chosen name is a gender neutral one (sneaky sneaky), but its...caused a bit of eyebrow raise from the boyfriend. Don\'t get me wrong, he\'s an absolute sweetheart and we go out of our way for each other a lot, he\'s just a little confused. Anyways, someone walked in once and used my chosen name and he just kinda looked at me like ""what"" out of sheer confusion. Reluctantly I told him that it was a name I went by and if it made it easy, he could just use my birth name. He\'s the only person outside of my parents who uses my birth name and its not a big deal...but at the same time it still feels off. \n\nI guess what I\'m trying to say is that I want to feel more valid...like I don\'t have to hide anything and that this could be perceived as ""normal"" by the people I love. I just want to be comfortable with myself around others but I\'m scared of being rejected. Does anybody know the best way to come out without there being an eruption of disappointment from my loved ones? I know you people must get these kinds of questions a lot and there may not be an easy solution but I\'m not sure where else to turn. I don\'t know many people personally who have also been through this dilemma. \n\nSorry if I talk too much, any advice would be very helpful, please and thank you?\n\n*Edit: Forgot a couple of words, please excuse me.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': ""I'm nervous about coming out and I'm in need of some advice."", 'created': 1453611304.0}"

140,2016-01-28 08:27:51,432g6e,11,4,"For background, I used to identify as genderfluid and am now ID'ing as a transguy. My opinions so far are based off of my own experiences, so I'm here hoping to hear what this community thinks.

It's not all that uncommon for trans people to identify as genderfluid at one point or another, just as it's not uncommon for gay folks to identify as bi at one point. Being bi or being genderfluid/genderqueer are obviously very real, even if some do just use it as a stepping stone. It's sometimes easier to go midway, you know?

Well, that was the case for me. My very early days, I'd go into groups and, when asked for my pronoun, I'd say, ""Oh I don't care, whatever you want."" This would lead to me just being called ""she"" because that's just the way my body most looks. I can't blame anyone for that, after all I said that I didn't care. In actuality, it mattered more to me than I realized. Later on, I ended up joining an LGBT group and asking for different pronouns at different weeks, until I figured out which one fit me the most, and I stuck with that.

Now, I find myself of this opinion: Choose a pronoun. Any pronoun. It can change by the day, it can be he or she or they or zir or whatever fits your needs. But, hearing anyone say ""Oh I don't care, whatever"" brings me to two conclusions: That, if they really don't care, then why bring it up? Or, two, that they might actually care but for whatever reason are too shy or scared or whatever to figure out what they actually need or want.

My opinions so far are based off of my own experiences, so I\'m here hoping to hear what this community thinks.\n\nIt\'s not all that uncommon for trans people to identify as genderfluid at one point or another, just as it\'s not uncommon for gay folks to identify as bi at one point. Being bi or being genderfluid/genderqueer are obviously very real, even if some do just use it as a stepping stone. It\'s sometimes easier to go midway, you know?\n\nWell, that was the case for me. My very early days, I\'d go into groups and, when asked for my pronoun, I\'d say, ""Oh I don\'t care, whatever you want."" This would lead to me just being called ""she"" because that\'s just the way my body most looks. I can\'t blame anyone for that, after all I said that I didn\'t care. In actuality, it mattered more to me than I realized. Later on, I ended up joining an LGBT group and asking for different pronouns at different weeks, until I figured out which one fit me the most, and I stuck with that.\n\nNow, I find myself of this opinion: Choose a pronoun. Any pronoun. It can change by the day, it can be he or she or they or zir or whatever fits your needs. But, hearing anyone say ""Oh I don\'t care, whatever"" brings me to two conclusions: That, if they really don\'t care, then why bring it up? Or, two, that they might actually care but for whatever reason are too shy or scared or whatever to figure out what they actually need or want.\n\nI acknowledge that I might be an asshole for believing this, or that I\'m seeing the world through my own experiences and not truly empathizing with how others are coping with their issues in their own ways.

First time coming here, and I'm still not really 100% sure if this is the right place to go to, but I desperately need someplace to go and get advice from people who understand what's happening with me.
So I have always been a pretty atypical person. I've fought a lot of battles in that regard as I'm autistic and it took me a tremendously long time to get people to understand that and for me to realise that it was something that made me who am I, and not something bad just because it wasn't normal. The same situation is now playing out again, this time in regards gender identity.

I have never fit comfortably into genders. Biologically I'm a girl, and so by default I've been forced to align myself with women - in some ways, it feels okay, but in other ways, I feel physically ill if I am related to any stereotypically female things e.g. long hair, dresses etc. At the same time, I do not wish to be male either, because I can't identify as 100% a man either.

After much confusion which I've mainly gone through alone, I've figured that I am some degree of agender or androgynous. I have always wanted to be seen as someone who appears as a girl with a boy's haircut, who does not abide by either gender - the idea is so freeing, and so me, and has been around for my entire life. Now that I'm 19, I can't stand to continue much longer into my future as a fake happy girl just to keep my parents happy - I need to cut my hair short and wear the boyish shirts I like, or I know I will never truly be content.

The problem is: My parents are wonderful people and care deeply for me, but they don't understand. They've told me all of the hurtful things -  It's a confusing situation made all the more confusing by, as an autistic kid growing up, I would always look to them for guidance on how the real world worked. Having grown up now, it's hard to realise that sometimes even your rock of knowledge can be grossly incorrect and offensive about something, and in this case it's holding me back from being the free someone I was always meant to be. With my autism, it's increasingly difficult to figure out when they are lying about something to avoid me being myself.
 
I think most of all I need someone else to explain what's going on here, and how I could go about allowing my physical self to finally reflect the androgynous self I've always been.

I'm currently dating someone (we've been dating for eons) who has been questioning their gender since we met. I consider myself fairly well versed in gender stuff, but obviously that can only help to an extent, since each person is different. Anywho, to the point, my partner was dmab, and is not out to their family/a good portion of their friends. I find myself lapsing into using male pronouns constantly, and struggling when they're in a feminine headspace. Part of this is because for a long time, I had no idea that they were genderfluid. For a long time, they identified to me, and to most people online, as mtf. We started dating whilst they were identifying as trans feminine. I myself am panromantic, but I'm questioning my sexuality. While I've always been attracted to all genders sexually, I find myself having trouble with the idea of my partner changing things about their body, particularly their penis. My big problem with dating women has always been that while I am terribly attracted to them, a good majority of them have vaginas, which I have, and as someone who quite enjoys being penetrated, a dildo just doesn't bring me the same kind of pleasure &amp; closeness as having my partner inside of me.

I love this person with all of my heart, and the thought of them being in a body that makes them feel dysphoric literally keeps me up at night. When they say they hate themselves, think they're ugly, I almost can't bare it. I wish that they could see that they can be a beautiful girl, boy, or nonbinary person in the body that they're in right now. I'm actually in tears right now, thinking about it. 

I suppose my question is, what can I do? What can I say? How can I help? I'm hesitant to even talk about it with them, because I just...

19,2016-01-13 18:59:39,40thso,6,23,"My girlfriend of 5 years, whom I was engaged to be married to, recently broke off our engagement. I suffer from depression, and while it's definitely exhausting for me to deal with, it's also certainly been exhausting for my partner to deal with as well. She said she felt like she was living more for me and not enough for her, and she simply couldn't handle it anymore.

The other big reason for our break up was my genderfluidity. We'd been together for 5 years and she's known about my gender identity for 3 of those years. At first she wasn't sure what to make of my crossdressing, but she figured that clothes are just clothes and it was nothing else. The more I began to explore my gender, the more uneasiness she felt but she still tried to be supportive and open minded. I always tried to make her feel comfortable while also asserting my own identity, and though I assured her again and again that I wasn't going to transition (because I honestly don't think it would resolve anything for me), I've always sensed that her unease never really left. She did well enough to refer to me with female pronouns and the name I've chosen for when I am in girlmode, most of the time (usually when we were with others that also knew about my genderfluidity) but even getting her to do that was met with some difficulty and adjustment. Recently I thought we had come to a place of understanding, enough that I could truly be myself with someone who really loves me for who I am. I was wrong.

When she ended things, she told me she couldn't reconcile the thought of me being a woman (even part time) when she knew me as the man I was born as. Though I told her that many of the innate qualities she loved in me as a person came from my female side, she said that she simply cannot love me as a woman. Something about it just doesn't compute with her/makes her uncomfortable. She tried, she really did, really hard, but she can't anymore. It's not just the dysphoria, which really ties into my depression, but the very notion of me being both male and female. She said that not knowing who she was coming home to and how to treat me gave her tremendous anxiety. I tried to see if we could compromise, if I could be less polarizing (as well as promising to start seeing a therapist again, which is what I was planning on doing anyway before this all happened), but she wouldn't have it. She said she couldn't.

I feel awful, heartbroken, and utterly alone. I never saw this relationship as the end-all/be-all to my problems but it was my constant, my harbor, and so long as I had this, I could weather the storm and deal with the depression and any negative aspects of my genderfluidity, like dysphoria, but now I don't have that. Now, when I'm a girl, I don't feel joyful or free or beautiful. At best, I feel nothing like I used to when I'd express my femme self. At worst, I feel guilty, ashamed, and just all around awful. Though I am glad that I have embraced my genderfluidity and I'm open to alot of people, I now often wish I hadn't told her or anyone. This has felt like it's brought me more grief than joy. I know how self-destructive that line of thinking can be, but I can't help feeling this way, anymore than I can help being the way I am.

I just had to vent somewhere. Being in a supportive relationship, with a seemingly supportive partner, I never thought I would lose the person I love the most because of wanting to be myself and sharing that.

I tried to see if we could compromise, if I could be less polarizing (as well as promising to start seeing a therapist again, which is what I was planning on doing anyway before this all happened), but she wouldn't have it. She said she couldn't.\n\nI feel awful, heartbroken, and utterly alone. I never saw this relationship as the end-all/be-all to my problems but it was my constant, my harbor, and so long as I had this, I could weather the storm and deal with the depression and any negative aspects of my genderfluidity, like dysphoria, but now I don't have that. Now, when I'm a girl, I don't feel joyful or free or beautiful. At best, I feel nothing like I used to when I'd express my femme self. At worst, I feel guilty, ashamed, and just all around awful. Though I am glad that I have embraced my genderfluidity and I'm open to alot of people, I now often wish I hadn't told her or anyone. This has felt like it's brought me more grief than joy. I know how self-destructive that line of thinking can be, but I can't help feeling this way, anymore than I can help being the way I am.\n\nI just had to vent somewhere. Being in a supportive relationship, with a seemingly supportive partner, I never thought I would lose the person I love the most because of wanting to be myself and sharing that. If any of you out there have gone through something similar, I'd appreciate any advice on how you dealt, or are dealing with it, and I'm also incredibly sorry for everyone that this has happened to."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Relationship ended, due in large part to my genderfluidity.', 'created': 1452736779.0}"

The best place to get to know my is probably on my tumblr (pinstripes-and-roses.tumblr.com), but for anyone who is curious, here's me:

I'm 38 years old. I've always known that something was different about me. Pre- and early into puberty I thought I might be gay, because I secretly liked a lot of traditionally girly things. I wanted to dress like a girl. I never opened up to my family or anyone else about any of it. And of course, I never acted on it. I was bullied and picked on enough as it was for being tall, skinny, nerdy, and un-athletic. I also had a lot of body issues growing up, which I blamed on not liking how skinny I was at the time. 

Once I started dating girls, and realized that I was exclusively sexually attracted to women, I was able to rule out being gay. But I still felt off.

Finally, as trans awareness bloomed, so did I. Wow, that sounds so lame, but I am going to leave it rather than fuss over words. It took me a long time to open up about it, but I think I've had a better idea of who I am in my mind for a few years now. 

I've been happily married for over ten years, and my wife and I have one child. I came out as genderfluid to my wife earlier this week. She has been supportive, and I am so thankful for that. She's had questions and concerns, but she has been so loving and helpful. It's more than I could have imagined.

I'm still trying to figure out the best label for me to use (more for others than for me, I'm not big on them personally), but so far the best one I can find is demiguy. No matter where on the gender spectrum I am, I still feel anchored to being male. Much of the time, I feel 100% male. And often I float over to androgyny, and femme. While I look forward to crossdressing, I can't see myself presenting as female often. Mostly I just want to add some androgyny to my style, maybe rock a maxi skirt or some cute tops. Something silky for the bedroom, perhaps.

I haven't come out to friends (yet) or family, so I don't post selfies or use my real name.

Names are funny things.

In the past people’s names changed: they changed with their jobs and forefathers jobs, giving us names like Cooper, Fletcher and Smith; they changed for their parents, giving us names like Harrison, Johnson and Peterson; they changed with where we lived, giving us names like Essex, York and Saxe-Cobourg. Some places still change names like that, Iceland for one.The changing of names is a slow one. Every so often you encounter individuals where the changing of names happens much faster, sometimes you find an individual whom has deliberately stopped the changing of a name for one reason or another.

But these are changes to surnames and the changes we’re talking about with these names is cross generational, parents and children having different surnames. A closer look at the word tells its tale a little bit more: sur, the French for below or under, a sub name to tell you apart from every tom, dick and harry with the same name as you.  

Most people only have one name, this name can have any number of different bits, from something simple like John Smith, to something complex like Eleanor Elizabeth Rebecca Fitzwilliam-Smythe. It is one name referring to one individual over the period of a lifetime. Nicknames are a popular way of changing a name, but they tend to be temporary and situational, and people tend not to think of themselves as their nickname.

I’m Anna, and I have two names. Anna isn’t the name I was given by my parents, but it’s part of me now. I’m not always Anna, but that’s something for later, first I’ll talk about how I came to be Anna and how i got where i am now.

I had a single name a while ago, but slowly I came to realise: this name wasn’t right for me all the time, the feeling of not rightness grew and blossomed and became a feeling of wrongness, my single name became wrong for me some of the time. For a long time I worked on trying to tweak my given name, but it never quite felt right and we had someone else in our family with a very similar name to mine, in the end I decided I wanted a clean break from the family of names surrounding my given name. After playing with my given name I looked at Selene, I was a fan of Greek mythology and space, the name of the Greek goddess for the Moon seemed like a nice choice; but eventually I moved away from it, it was too awkward on the tongue and a pain to set down in writing, the final nail in the coffin was the realisation that actually I wasn’t elegant enough to pull off a name like Selene. Finally I stumbled on a name in a book I was reading, it struck a chord with me and I did some digging into the name, the different forms, the history and the meaning of it, and I knew who I was.

In finding my new name I had finished a process which had started when I was about 12, the first step in a journey which took on a new significance and new personal speed when I was 15. I was roughly 15 when I talked to my parents and a GP about this journey for the first time, I was met with disapproval and disbelief by all three of them, and the GP told me I was too young to be able to know about it. Horrified by what was happening, to what I wanted to be a nice simple discussion, I ran from my journey and buried as much of it as deep as I could for a long time; having changed nothing about what was happening to me. It wasn’t until I was 18 and in Upper Sixth that I began to re-open what I had buried and I began re-examining this journey thoroughly, this was when I returned to my name for the first time in nearly 4 years. The journey sped up when I got to university, but not at first. In my first year I was shy and spent most of the year building my confidence. I debated joining a society meant to advocate for people like me but wrestling past their hedonism to find the activism was an Odyssey in its own right, so I decided to stay away; I also encountered a society of fantasists and dreamers and fell in with them as a true geek. In my second year I considered the support society again but Bacchus still danced among them, I became more involved with the fantasists and made many friendships that survive to this day. I also met a spiny leaf in a famous sort of Suinae field, a saint in variegated armour who showed me a way forwards, something I’d not been aware of; a path my journey could travel down more smoothly. In my third year and beyond the relationships I had built grew stronger, some were tested and survived, and the confidence and advice imparted to me by the cultivar crested champion saw me through many hard and dark times.

I’m Anna, and I have two names. Anna isn’t the name I was given by my parents, But it’s part of me now. I’m not always Anna and now you know how that happened and how i got here, i think it’s late enough now.
