1,2016-12-04 17:26:14,5ggh5k,16,5,"Hello!

I am designing a product that involves asking for gender identity at one point in the setup process. This question is very important to the product, and we're only asking it because it will make what we're doing significantly more meaningful.

In previous projects, I've used three text-based options -- male, female, other ^see ^note (which prompts an optional ""specify"" field) -- but this time I'm looking to do something more graphical / visual.

So my question is about gender symbols, and which symbol(s) might be most appropriate when placed with the binary Mars and Venus symbols.

Obviously, presenting [all the options](https://neuwritesd.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/1420041082350.png) would be wonderful, but unfortunately there just won't be enough space and it would create a difficult-to-manage user interface.

I love the *look* of this [transgender symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/A_TransGender-Symbol_Plain3.svg/2000px-A_TransGender-Symbol_Plain3.svg.png) and the [other gender symbol](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Gender-Symbol_Other_dark_transparent_Background.png), but I'm not well-versed enough to know what either are considered inclusive of.

Do either of those symbols resonate with you in a positive or negative way? Is there another symbol I'm missing that you would think ""that's me"" if you saw it presented in a user interface?

Any advice / thoughts would be so helpful! Thank you!

*Note: I've never been a huge fan of the ""Other"" text label. I know there is sensitivity around the use of the word to describe non-binary gender identities. I've considered using ""Specify"" alone, but some people would rather not provide details, but would like to acknowledge that they are not male or female.

Obviously there's been a lot of press surrounding non-binary people and gender identities, and I've ready some articles about things going on (mainly at universities) and I have some question.

My current understanding is that sex and gender are separate, as in sex is defined purely by your chromosomes?

When discussing gender I get a little lost, and don't tend to follow the idea about how gender is for lack of a better word a ""scale"" or ""spectrum"".

In the case of sexual orientation, it is determined by your sexual attractions (gay, lesbian, bisexual, straight). How is your gender determined?

I hope this doesn't come off as offensive, as I don't understand much at all. But for instance, take somebody who is male in all aspects of the gender, except they like to wear makeup or cross-dress is that person then non-binary to an extent?

I'm not looking to start a debate here so if the mods see comments they don't like or if anything I say is below the belt, please let me know. I'm just looking to gain an understanding as people I've spoke to personally who are against the equality/social  issues faced by non-binary people, but they themselves are non-binary and haven't gave me enough of an understanding about being non-binary and what it means to a person.

I'm pretty comfortable with my gender identity, though I keep taking parts of the word off and putting others on (androgynous, androgyous-fluid, androgynous-flux, etc etc lol).

But,  I have yet to really get into my groove as far as presentation. 

Partly because I grew up a 'tomboy' wearing jeans &amp; T-shirts, partly because shopping of any kind (on the rare occasion i can afford it) gives me incredible anxiety,  partly because I don't know how to put clothes together,and the rest of it is all about my body shape. 

I'm 5'2"" AFAB, the scale goes betwern 150-160 lbs on any given day, and it may just be me but i feel like i have a ridiculously short torso. My legs aren't that long, though. 

i would like to buy another binder, but also wonder if a compression bra of sorts would be easier on my ribs (possible pancreas/gallbladder problems???¿¿??)

Ideally I'd be at least kind-of thin, long-bodied male-passing dude with long-ass hair, but i am not to the attainable parts of that yet. 
Like Yoichi from Drifters, ren from nu'est, etc...

But, sometimes I see an afab (usually cis girl) person, and I'm like... if I looked like them I'd be golden. ????

I want to either have people question themselves when they see me (is that a guy or a girl?), look like a 'feminine' guy... (Ideally i would eventually have my voice lowered (there's surgery for that if I'm not mistaken))

Does any of this make sense? 

But, like... What can I do? 

How do I make my torso look longer? Hips/thighs less wide? How do I wear skirts &amp; dresses (and makeup?) without being pegged as a girl? would pics help? Or do I just need to be more, like, confident? 

Is this just me, or is this a very nonbinary feel? how in the heck does one assert for use of proper names/pronouns? 

Like, my life would be easier if I were surrounded by my friends all the time, bc they are all chill about it, but i see my friends at best 1 night every week or so (which sounds pretty frequent, but I spend 95% of the rest of my time at home)

That's not what I'm about, though, and if I wanted to write a story just to pander and get readers, I can get a lot closer to the lowest common denominator than just including a genderqueer character. that's now how I roll. I take writing seriously.

now, I'm going to give the basic rundown of my protagonist's situation, and I'd like any feedback people can give, if they think it's too forced, if they think it sounds trite, whatever.

so, things start out with a pair of low level nobles in a fantasy setting, having a baby girl. a doctor tells them they'll be unable to conceive again, and because of local laws and traditions, they need to have a male heir.

the baby is forcibly raised to be male. she has no choice in the matter. some days she feels fine with it, other days she wishes she could escape from it.

then she gets her wish. that medical person from before? apparently not super sure on how the body works in a rather low-tech, mid-level magic type of world, imagine that. they have a baby boy. She packs up her belongings, says her goodbyes, and ventures off into the world, excited to not have a future that is bound by what her parents are forcing her to be, and travels for a long while. but she still dresses and acts as a young man. because that's all she knows.

plot happens, and eventually, with the help of a caring friend, she begins dressing and coding as a girl. and she loves it! she feels absolutely liberated. she has to be careful, because some people are closed minded and have swords, but she is enthralled with this part of her life she was never allowed to have.

but after a while of this, she's laying in bed, and she starts thinking...is this it? is this who she's going to be forever? she realizes that she doesn't want that. sometimes, she doesn't feel like a girl. if she just puts herself in that role forever, it'll be trading one prison for another.

after some soul searching as the story progresses, she realizes that she doesn't want to choose. she shouldn't have to choose. she's both. she's happy being both. and she's not going to give that up.

there's a lot more that's going to go into this story than that one aspect of this character's arc, but yeah. I would like to know if anyone sees any glaring problems with this as a gradual evolution of a character realizing they're genderqueer in a world where that doesn't exist as a known possibility.

She packs up her belongings, says her goodbyes, and ventures off into the world, excited to not have a future that is bound by what her parents are forcing her to be, and travels for a long while. but she still dresses and acts as a young man. because that's all she knows.\n\nplot happens, and eventually, with the help of a caring friend, she begins dressing and coding as a girl. and she loves it! she feels absolutely liberated. she has to be careful, because some people are closed minded and have swords, but she is enthralled with this part of her life she was never allowed to have.\n\nbut after a while of this, she's laying in bed, and she starts thinking...is this it? is this who she's going to be forever? she realizes that she doesn't want that. sometimes, she doesn't feel like a girl. if she just puts herself in that role forever, it'll be trading one prison for another.\n\nafter some soul searching as the story progresses, she realizes that she doesn't want to choose. she shouldn't have to choose. she's both. she's happy being both. and she's not going to give that up.\n\nthere's a lot more that's going to go into this story than that one aspect of this character's arc, but yeah.

34,2016-12-22 20:12:47,5jsqo9,2,2,"Hello, all,

I've predominantly identified as female my whole life, but I feel like that doesn't adequately describe my gender identity.

When I was four or five I adopted a male persona named Joey, who was my idea of the quintessential 90's guy: loud polo shirt, cargo shorts, backwards baseball cap, sunglasses, sneakers, too-cool-for-school attitude. My mom thought this was adorable/creative and encouraged me, while my dad low key freaked out about it. However, he was not super involved in my life and I had much more regard for my mom's opinion than his.

In second grade, I changed my name to Max. All my friends at school and my teacher were cool with it. Then one day, about two or three weeks in, I had a substitute teacher who gave me grief for it, so I went back to my girl name.

My mom was cool with the name change, though. Overall, she did a great job not strictly enforcing gender roles on my brother and me. She would never designate a Barbie as a ""girl toy"" or a Tonka truck as a ""boy toy,"" and would let either of us play with whatever toys we wanted. When other adults called me ""bossy,"" she would say that I was assertive or a leader. She taught my brother that it was okay to cry and otherwise express his feelings, and that his favorite color could indeed be pink. Once I declared that I no longer wanted to wear dresses or skirts, she accepted it and let me wear pants, shorts, and overalls. 

Despite the nuanced understanding of gender that she tried to foster, as I got older I saw that society regarded men and women, as well as masculinity and femininity, as binaries. I staunchly identified with everything masculine and eschewed all things feminine. All of my friends were boys, and I referred to myself as a tomboy.

When I went through puberty, however, I started feeling more pressure to be feminine and present as a woman. I also developed a negative body image and self-esteem issues. Not being feminine no longer felt like a choice: it felt like I was too ugly to be a woman.

Now that I'm older, I've become comfortable with and confident in myself. I went to a 90's costume party as Joey and felt super strong and confident adopting a masculine persona. I've recently cut my hair short, so my general look is fairly androgynous.

When I was sixteen or seventeen, I began to identify as bisexual, and coming to that realization was a very nerve-wracking experience for me. More recently I started to identify as pansexual, and going through the questioning phase was less stressful this time. I'm more comfortable with not knowing now, so I'm sure I'll find a way to describe my gender identity, that feels right to me, with time and I'm fine if there's a wait.

Right now I'm thinking I will probably identify as something other than female, but I'm not quite sure what term most suits me. Hence my post here. I want to do some research and learn more before coming to a determination.",NonBinary,Questioning my gender identity,1482462767.0,"{'created_utc': 1482437567, 'id': '5jsqo9', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Hello, all,\n\nI\'ve predominantly identified as female my whole life, but I feel like that doesn\'t adequately describe my gender identity.\n\nWhen I was four or five I adopted a male persona named Joey, who was my idea of the quintessential 90\'s guy: loud polo shirt, cargo shorts, backwards baseball cap, sunglasses, sneakers, too-cool-for-school attitude.

I remember when I read Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Leguin in high school, I felt oddly connected to it. My teacher taught it from the perspective of a feminist sci fi world construction, which it undeniably is, but I felt somehow really into this world on a deeper level.

because of school issues where courses i need for college are being discontinued (im trying to get into art school btw), ive been seriously considering applying to the art high school downtown to finish those credits. this school i at least know is incredibly accepting and i wont have to worry about my identity being an issue there.

On the streetcar today there was a man dressed in a man's coat and baseball cap, with lipstick and eye makeup and pumps. I don't know whether he was trans.

6,2016-12-02 21:14:57,5g5tjs,14,9,"Hello there! I come here, after reading a bit, with some questions.
In advance, I would like to apologize if any of my views or arguments come off as offensive. This is not what I mean with this post.

For some background, I am cis-male, 25 years old.
I'm not sure(As many other users on this subreddit and other sites) if I may be transgeder, or if I just like the idea of crossdressing, be it because I find femenine clothing more appealing, or because I maybe want to be a girl.

Now, I don't have any kind of dysphoria, and I am quite happy with my body. But I always liked better the idea of being a girl. Traditionally girly things were always more appealing to me(And still are). Whenever I get to pick a character, I go for the girl, be it in videogames, LARP, tabletop RPGs...
This alone could mean literally nothing, and I know that. But since I hit puberty, I've been feeling a sense of longing, wishing I was born female instead. And the feeling doesn't go away.
I crossdress whenever I'm home alone, and I love every second of it(Although I'm affraid to go outside wearing skirts/dresses and such).

There's one thing that keeps pushing me back from even considering transitioning, and that is that our current medicine and technology wouldn't allow a full transition, as I'd like it to be. Some sort of brain transplant, for instance, where my mind is fully realocated within a female body. That would be perfect, although unrealistic.

Now comes the problematic part of this post, but please, bear with me. And if I'm wrong(I'm pretty sure I am!) please, do tell me. As I see it, transitioning is incomplete. No one can fully transition from their physical sex to another one. For instance, if I decided to fully transition, I would be almost 100% female in functionality, but I'd be missing out some parts of being female, such as periods, or pregnancy. And from my standpoint that just doesn't makes the cut.
Maybe I'm romanticizing the whole part of suffering monthly cramps, maybe someone who went through transitioning can steer me in the right direction.
Or maybe someone out here is just wishing to discuss things, and perhaps help me figure things out?

the problem is, i don't really know what i want with my future, like the hormones, they help me with my emotions and depression, so i'm gonig to continue with it, but i don't know if i really want to transition if getting a job is as hard as i hear it to be. 

i could be sad for my whole life, but not being a functional member of society will make me depressed, so it doesn't make sense to try to solve my depression and find myself going into another one

the question is, is it really that hard? (i live in UK, but i'm actually a chinese, and i would like to consider a potential for working back home at hong kong).

This is going for years now, like there would be a period i think i am trash, or just fap it away as a fetish and then there's a period i am fine with being gay and living my life. 
The trans thing mainly occurs when i see good looking passing trannies or s/fur shit.

There was a time when i was young that thought i was trans, like 16 years old, spend time reading stuff online and then forgot about it when i went to sleep, there there was another bigger later phase around when i was 22 thinking i am actually trans for like 1-2 months but then it passed once i realized it could just be some weird humiliation fetish since it often times also causes me sexual arousal thinking of being a woman.

I dont know if this is a real thing or just a fetish, i am probably also scared that if it is real i am fucked because my job is mainly male and trans isnt something widely accepted in some EU countries so there might be no way to actually do it financially and the future will be literally fucked. Plus i have a weird dislike of women who act slutty or manipulative, probably because i hate my mother for being an angry whiny bitch but that is another reason i dont feel i should be a girl.

The confusing thing is that most of the time i could not care less and feel no issues with being cis gay but every now and then, specifically when i come by some passing tranny or some female that looks attractive i feel like i would want to be a woman, then i usually just fap to some fantasy where i am the female and the thoughts go away for some time, can even be months without those feelings.",trans,Am I transgender or is this a fetish?,1481474771.0,"{'created_utc': 1481449571, 'id': '5hpeon', 'num_comments': 7, 'score': 7, 'selftext': ""Am I transgender or is this a fetish?\n\nThis is going for years now, like there would be a period i think i am trash, or just fap it away as a fetish and then there's a period i am fine with being gay and living my life. \nThe trans thing mainly occurs when i see good looking passing trannies or s/fur shit.\n\nThere was a time when i was young that thought i was trans, like 16 years old, spend time reading stuff online and then forgot about it when i went to sleep, there there was another bigger later phase around when i was 22 thinking i am actually trans for like 1-2 months but then it passed once i realized it could just be some weird humiliation fetish since it often times also causes me sexual arousal thinking of being a woman.\n\nI dont know if this is a real thing or just a fetish, i am probably also scared that if it is real i am fucked because my job is mainly male and trans isnt something widely accepted in some EU countries so there might be no way to actually do it financially and the future will be literally fucked.

My boyfriend just told me he thinks he maybe trans. I finally flat out asked him because I had a feeling he might be. He gave me an opening and I took it. I'm pretty sure he was wanting me to ask. I can't imagine carrying that burden. 

His answer was, ""Maybe."" 

We had the conversation over a messaging app since we currently live in other countries and I imagine it was easier for him to talk about in that manner. 

I'll preface this that I've been a lifelong champion of the LGBTQ community. I fully understand gender and sex are two different things. 

But I feel like my heart has been shattered. I'm madly in love with him and I don't believe that will ever change.

But just like he can't change who he is, I can't change who I am. 

I told him I would support whatever he wanted to do. I told him I would be there every step of the way if this is what he ultimately decided to do. I also had to be honest, I don't think the sexual side of our relationship would continue. It would evolve into something else but that part would likely cease. 

He said he wouldn't do it if that was the case. I told him, ""You can't make that decision based on me. You'll just end up resenting me. If that's what you are then that's what you are...and if you're happier being a woman then that's what you need to be. I'll still love you. That will never change. But I also can't change what I'm attracted to.""

Now he says he only wants to have the top surgery but not the bottom. I wouldn't be surprised if that eventually change because I'm wondering if there's a bit of denial going on. 

I guess I'm asking for guidance. He seems unsure and I want to be there for him on this journey. But, I have a feeling I'm going to end up breaking his heart because I can't continue our relationship in a physical sense. I wish I could but I can't. Which breaks my heart as well. 

I now have to spend Christmas with my family and pretend this isn't happening.

I'm in a steady, wonderful relationship with a bisexual male right now, and his coming out to me was this beautiful sigh of relief almost two years ago that allowed me to more comfortably explore my identity. 

I had struggled for years with a feeling that I could only subscribe to the idea that putting on lipstick some days made me feel like I was putting on drag. I would look the same as the day before, sometimes down to my work uniform. But something about how I saw myself made me feel noticeably different, almost incorrect. Out of place. Four years ago, for example, I had a rush of excitement about cutting off my hair if only so that I could look ambiguous and non specific. 

I don't remember how the pieces fell together. Maybe I searched for flags or pronouns or something popped up on tumblr. But I found androgyny as a concept, and Androgyne as a term of identity. So, that's where things started to get easier. 

My wardrobe attempts to be neutral. Collared shirts and sweatshirts as well as dresses and knee highs. I want to reach a point of physical androgyny where I can mix these things up. I've played with makeup, how to work with my face and contouring and things like that to present one way or the other. But I still feel stuck, non-malleable. Feminine AF. 

Several months ago, I went to a house party, got belligerently drunk, and confessed my affections to a straight boy I had known for a while. When he rejected me (politely), I cried in the middle of this house party about how ""boys don't like girls like me."" He later tried to tell me that he was at a point in his life where was questioning his sexuality, and thought he might be bisexual, so it wasn't the time for him to really invest in anyone emotionally. Parts of me wanted to scream out that I was exactly what he needed, I was the perfect solution! I was every bisexuals dream mate, I'd pull on a strap on or be a French maid or whatever they want sexually because I'm all of that rolled up into one, right? That's how this works, right?

At the end of the day, I'm stuck in this place where I still get swipes on tinder from straight boys and bisexual girls. But there's not a broad trans or queer community around here, and there's still that disgusting feeling of knowing that I'm not sure a gay male will ever look at me and want anything to do with me, or that a lesbian into femmes might be turned off by what I'm into or who I am or how I present myself sometimes. I have so many days where I want to tell people I'm a boy but it will cause problems the next day when I'm not or I'm not sure. 

I want to text that guy from the party sometimes to ask him how he'd feel if I could be a boy for him, as long as sometimes I could be a girl, too. Is that okay? 

How do you work through this? How do you feel comfortable in such an ever changing environment? Am I new-age tumblr-in-action garbage?

With this in mind I plan to angle as if I wish to transition completely to a binary female and eventually get gender reassignment surgery (which I definitely do not want) Changing my name via deedpoll (even though it is already gender neutral), showing up to my gp and later GIC wearing a dress, the whole shebang. Then, when they ask if I want to increase my estrogen dose a few weeks/months into the treatment I will say I am happy with how things are going and I don't need a higher dose.

I am worried, however, that if I develop further male secondary sexual characteristics before I can start treatment I might have to resort to self-medicating, which I hear is really quite dangerous.

I am 32, and have lived a closeted life in the Southern US my entire life. About six months ago I came out as trans and began HRT. I know this is the right path for me, and I haven't had any serious misgivings about it since I came out. I filed to have my name and gender changed, got a new wardrobe, and finally don't see a stranger when I look at myself in the mirror. All of these things feel so incredibly validating, however, I am still of a somewhat divided mind about my public presentation. 

I know a lot of trans folks struggle with the issue of passing in public, and I get that there is a whole range of reasons for this, both personal and social. The feeling of vulnerability or risk associated with being publicly identified as trans (or having any non traditional gender identity) is definitely real, especially in the southern US. 

But I also feel this personal slippery slope. Like, when I was pretending to be a boy growing up, I was HYPER focused on my appearance and presentation. I got teased for everything from the way I stood, sat, talked, etc. for being ""a sissy"".. this led me to develop all of these artificial personality traits and affectations that isolated me from the people around me. I was afraid to let them see the real me, because they would know right away what I was. I even shaved my head for nearly 10 years because my long, wavy hair would give me away, so to speak. 

So now I guess I am struggling a bit with my desire to pass as female. Is this just me, once again, seeking to conform to the expectations I feel around me? To present in a way that is ""safe"" and ""acceptable"" to people around me?

I know this isn't the case for every trans person, and some of my best friends feel very differently about this. They consider themselves simply men &amp; women and think of their transsexuality as a purely medical issue, and i totally get this. 

I guess what is confusing/difficult for me is trying to balance this desire to be authentic to myself with my desire for social acceptance.

44,2016-12-11 20:12:52,5hs3fq,14,16,"TL;DR  I thought I was trans (FtM), but after accepting and exploring my masculine side some more, I've become strangely more okay with being feminine and less certain that I want hormones.  I definitely need an outlet to explore my gender identity, but I am confused now as to what form that should take.

Hi everyone.  I have some gender identity issues I'm sorting out, and I used to think I was trans (FtM), but now I'm not sure it's that simple.  I do have a relationship with a straight cis man, which complicates things (we are talking through it and he is giving me space to explore, but he's clearly very anxious), but I want to focus on my own feelings.

I have always wished/believed I were a boy, since I was in preschool.  Puberty as a female was horrible for me.  Then I tried to ignore dysphoria and live as a masculine/androgynous woman (I'm over 30 now).

Last year, dypshoria raged up, focused on wanting a deeper voice, facial hair, and muscles.  I now live in an area very accepting of queer people.  I told my friends and family what was going on, joined a friend/support group, cut my hair, bought a binder and men's clothes, picked a name, and began seriously thinking about testosterone.  I feel very positive about most of what I've done so far.  In fact I have a consultation appointment next week to discuss T.

But... 

Right after I made the consultation appointment, my brain suddenly screamed, ""NO.""  Suddenly I did not want to proceed with T.  It doesn't feel entirely like fear (although there is definitely fear of the unknown, as well), it feels like no, this isn't what I want.  

See, there are situations where I like being female, and this has always been a stable facet of my personality.  I said when I started coming out, that I feel like a guy 60-70% of the time, but not 100%.  That proportion has been stable throughout my life.  I have no problem with PIV sex and being treated as female/feminine during that activity.  I enjoy the way men treat me, as female, when we're in a romantic relationship.  I never get dolled up to an extremely feminine degree, but for example, I enjoy wearing low-cut shirts or a skirt when I'm out on a date with my SO.  Not always, but it's not uncommon, either.  I know I look good and I feel sexy like that.  Makeup is a no, but jewelry and female clothes are a yes.  I've been enjoying women's clothes a bit more since giving room to my masculine side.  I *also* really like my short hair, wearing my binder and men's clothes, and being called by my male name by friends in the know.

Therefore, I am not sure anymore that T is for me.  I like my curvy hips (except when trying to squeeze into men's pants) and I like my breasts, mostly.  Sometimes I wish they were bigger, sometimes I wish they were gone, but I don't want top surgery because I'd miss them.  I want muscles, facial hair, and a deeper voice, but my body modification desires have a very hard stop at that point.  I hate the idea of body hair; I like my soft, smooth, hairless skin.  I don't really want a penis (I wouldn't mind having one, but I like my vagina well enough, and very much do not want my clit to grow).  I tried packing with a roll of socks and it did nothing for me, I didn't care that it was there or have any interest in it.  If I went bald on T, I would feel horrible, as I like my hair.  I also suspect, from looking at the men in my family, that I wouldn't get a very deep voice or very much facial hair anyway.  That means I'd likely only get an increase in muscle mass, which, to be fair, I do want; it was my earliest sign of dysphoria.

But I think being overtly male would cause me as much bodily distress as I'm already in, it would just focus on different things.  And I don't get to pick and choose what changes I get.  

Also, I enjoy compartmentalizing who I'm out to.  For example, I have never, ever had the desire to legally change my name or my gender marker.  For example, I don't want people at work to know - my personal life is just not their business.  So I feel like if I started T and my body changed, but didn't change my name or gender marker, I'd have to lie or explain it over and over and I don't want to.  I definitely want my friends and family to know, but I kind of like that it's this secret life I get to explore on my own time; I don't care a whole lot that the general public views me as female, except when dealing with sexism (I've been lucky and not encountered it much).  I do need an outlet for my masculine side, I can't keep it completely to myself, but right now it feels like a secret identity, and that feels *fun*.

Furthermore, general mental health issues:  I regularly suffer from pretty extreme depression and anxiety, and I wonder if T might help with that.  But then again, I suspect I'm idealizing T as a magic bullet for my mental health, and that I'd feel better on it for a while, then realize I still have all this depressive crap there to deal with.  I have also had over two years of major upheavals in my life that are certainly not easy to deal with even at the best of times.

I am in counseling with a therapist specializing in gender identity issues, and it's helping a lot.  More than any counseling I've ever had, and I've been through a lot of counselors.  I'm not on antidepressants at the moment; I've tried several, and tend to have bad mental reactions to them, and react very differently even if the inert ingredients change (like from one generic to another).

I definitely need an outlet to explore my gender identity, but I am confused now as to what form that should take.\n\nHi everyone.  I have some gender identity issues I\'m sorting out, and I used to think I was trans (FtM), but now I\'m not sure it\'s that simple.  I do have a relationship with a straight cis man, which complicates things (we are talking through it and he is giving me space to explore, but he\'s clearly very anxious), but I want to focus on my own feelings.\n\nI have always wished/believed I were a boy, since I was in preschool.  Puberty as a female was horrible for me.  Then I tried to ignore dysphoria and live as a masculine/androgynous woman (I\'m over 30 now).\n\nLast year, dypshoria raged up, focused on wanting a deeper voice, facial hair, and muscles.  I now live in an area very accepting of queer people.  I told my friends and family what was going on, joined a friend/support group, cut my hair, bought a binder and men\'s clothes, picked a name, and began seriously thinking about testosterone.  I feel very positive about most of what I\'ve done so far.  In fact I have a consultation appointment next week to discuss T.\n\nBut... \n\nRight after I made the consultation appointment, my brain suddenly screamed, ""NO.""  Suddenly I did not want to proceed with T.  It doesn\'t feel entirely like fear (although there is definitely fear of the unknown, as well), it feels like no, this isn\'t what I want.  \n\nSee, there are situations where I like being female, and this has always been a stable facet of my personality.  I said when I started coming out, that I feel like a guy 60-70% of the time, but not 100%.  That proportion has been stable throughout my life.  I have no problem with PIV sex and being treated as female/feminine during that activity.  I enjoy the way men treat me, as female, when we\'re in a romantic relationship.  I never get dolled up to an extremely feminine degree, but for example, I enjoy wearing low-cut shirts or a skirt when I\'m out on a date with my SO.  Not always, but it\'s not uncommon, either.  I know I look good and I feel sexy like that.  Makeup is a no, but jewelry and female clothes are a yes.  I\'ve been enjoying women\'s clothes a bit more since giving room to my masculine side.  I *also* really like my short hair, wearing my binder and men\'s clothes, and being called by my male name by friends in the know.\n\nTherefore, I am not sure anymore that T is for me.  I like my curvy hips (except when trying to squeeze into men\'s pants) and I like my breasts, mostly.  Sometimes I wish they were bigger, sometimes I wish they were gone, but I don\'t want top surgery because I\'d miss them.  I want muscles, facial hair, and a deeper voice, but my body modification desires have a very hard stop at that point.  I hate the idea of body hair; I like my soft, smooth, hairless skin.  I don\'t really want a penis (I wouldn\'t mind having one, but I like my vagina well enough, and very much do not want my clit to grow).  I tried packing with a roll of socks and it did nothing for me, I didn\'t care that it was there or have any interest in it.  If I went bald on T, I would feel horrible, as I like my hair.  I also suspect, from looking at the men in my family, that I wouldn\'t get a very deep voice or very much facial hair anyway.  That means I\'d likely only get an increase in muscle mass, which, to be fair, I do want; it was my earliest sign of dysphoria.\n\nBut I think being overtly male would cause me as much bodily distress as I\'m already in, it would just focus on different things.  And I don\'t get to pick and choose what changes I get.  \n\nAlso, I enjoy compartmentalizing who I\'m out to.  For example, I have never, ever had the desire to legally change my name or my gender marker.  For example, I don\'t want people at work to know - my personal life is just not their business.  So I feel like if I started T and my body changed, but didn\'t change my name or gender marker, I\'d have to lie or explain it over and over and I don\'t want to.  I definitely want my friends and family to know, but I kind of like that it\'s this secret life I get to explore on my own time; I don\'t care a whole lot that the general public views me as female, except when dealing with sexism (I\'ve been lucky and not encountered it much).  I do need an outlet for my masculine side, I can\'t keep it completely to myself, but right now it feels like a secret identity, and that feels *fun*.\n\nFurthermore, general mental health issues:  I regularly suffer from pretty extreme depression and anxiety, and I wonder if T might help with that.  But then again, I suspect I\'m idealizing T as a magic bullet for my mental health, and that I\'d feel better on it for a while, then realize I still have all this depressive crap there to deal with.  I have also had over two years of major upheavals in my life that are certainly not easy to deal with even at the best of times.\n\nI am in counseling with a therapist specializing in gender identity issues, and it\'s helping a lot.  More than any counseling I\'ve ever had, and I\'ve been through a lot of counselors.  I\'m not on antidepressants at the moment; I\'ve tried several, and tend to have bad mental reactions to them, and react very differently even if the inert ingredients change (like from one generic to another).  So I\'m leery of medication in general.\n\nWell.  I\'d love to hear from others who might be able to relate to some of what I\'ve written.

53,2016-12-14 04:29:21,5i8kvu,11,3,"Merry Christmas! I’ve been watching Rudoph the Red-nosed Reindeer (1964) the claymation Rankin-Bass classic, and I wanted to shed some light on how I watch the movie, and how I see it as a movie about the LGBTQ community coming together and rising above the adversity we have in our lives everyday. I do not think my take on the film was the original intention on the creators (with one small exception), but I do believe the message of Misfits finding a home was. I would love to hear your thoughts and input. 

Rudolf is born with an apparent “defect,” one could see this as a metaphor for a physical disability. I chose to think that Rudolf was born as transgender, inter-sexed or particularily flamboyant. His parents don’t take him to a doctor or seek out the advice of anyone else, they simple see the defect and immediately talk of making a “buck” out of him. They cover his nose and call him, “My normal little buck.” I have a theory that glowing red noses are something that happen at the northpole, and are just never talked about, considering his parents don’t see surprised, disappointed, but not surprised. 

Then we move to Hermey the elf. Hermey is gay. This is the one exception I made above, I think the creators intentionally made Hermey a gay character. One, he’s very sensitive and is the only male elf who styles his hair. This may seem like archaic stereotypes in 2016, but in 1964, these were tells. He also dreams of being a dentist, which I think is true, but there’s more than that, there’s an innate not fitting in or wanting to do what’s expected (Making toys = finding a wife, having a family ect.)  There is this small pause that happens every single time he declares his dream to be a… dentist. Hermey tries to fit in, by fixing the teeth in the dolls, but the act of trying to fit in only shows more and more of his Misfitness. 

Rudolph goes to the reindeer games, where his parents force him to look like the other young deer. Forcing him to wear things that are hiding his grater character. This strikes me as incredibly similar to stories of parents forcing their trans children in the dresses or suits. “There’s more important things than comfort, self respect” says Donner. 

Rudolph meets Fireball and Clarice. Fireball is just another reindeer who will be appalled by Rudolph’s true nature when he is outted during the reindeer games. These reindeer games, which seem to me like a sports team, complete with a coach wearing a whistle.  These games around about being bucks=men. The girls are just there to watch and it’s the boys, the real boys who are there to show their stuff. Rudolph preforms better than all the other bucks, but his flight is brought to an abrupt halt when his nose covering falls off and he is outted in front of the entire team. The way the other deer react, including Coach JerkFace is a nightmare (and reality) version of other people outting stories. Clarice, who declares Rudolph as “cute” right before he is outted, comes back to him insisting that his nose is what makes him special. She sings him a song that might as well be titled, “It Gets Better.” Clarice is the most open minded creature in the northpole, including Santa. 

It’s Clarice’s father who ruins it for everyone and drags his daughter away from the “weirdo.” This is when Rudolph finds Hermey, and they decide to run away together. This, I think, is a metaphor for the unity among the LGBTQ community back in 1964 when we had to band together as a community in the face of all the hate. Rudolph being trans, in different from Hermey who is gay, at times those communities overlap,  but it is not always the same story. However, Misfits are Misfits, and we find strength when we find each other. 

Enter Yukon Cornelius, who is not a metaphor, he is exactly as written. He is a Redneck with a heart of gold, a lower class white man who is also forced into the Misfit category because of his socioeconomic status. He knows he is at the bottom rung of society, which makes him more open minded to other Misfits. We see this happen in real life when small communities find out a member of their community is LGBTQ and accept them, because they are in the community. Google Stu Rasmussen if you don’t believe me.  
So our Misfits set out together, but they are not alone. They are followed by the abominable snow monster of the north, Old Bumble. This metaphor is of the very sad circumstances when a LGBTQ person is in denial. They hate themselves for being LBGTQ, but they also hate the community around them, knowing they’ll never be accepted by them. He is the ultimate Misfit, no room for him any where. He’s particularity drawn to Rudolph because he sees himself reflected in the young deer.  
The island of Misfit toys is obviously a gay bar, or at least a gay bar you would have found in the 1960s. Today it would be an LGBTQ center, or a Gender Health Center. A place for all us Misfits to find each other. I’m particularity interested in the doll and her passing privilege. She doesn’t declare why she is on the island, or what makes her different. She has passing privilege, but there is clearly something keeping her out of Santa’s bag. Sometimes LGBTQ status is invisible. 
The night that Hermey, Cornelius, and Rudolph spend on the island of Misfit toys, obviously gave Rudolph a lot to think about. Even on an island, full of other Misfits like him, he still feels like an outcast. Community is not just about being LGBTQ, yes that runs deep, but it’s not what defines us. Rudolph has a family, he has Clarice, he has an entire personality that doesn’t revolved around his nose. He may be a Misfit, but he is other things too. He truly feels he has no home. Until he can strike out on his own, a really find out what being a Red-Nosed Reindeer is all about. 
Rudolph goes home to face his parents, but they are gone. They went looking for him and got themselves caught by the abominable snow monster. 
Rudolph shows down with the Bumble, and Cornelius and Hermey come to the rescue. The three Misfits take away his teeth, his weapons (his “God Hates Fags” signs). Finally Bumble and Cornelius fall off a cliff together. Finally having the connection that the Bumble needs. A conservative Christian who doesn’t hate LGBTQ folks, Cornelius is the perfect match to finally show the Bumble what he needs to see in order to love himself. 
Everyone returns to Christmas town, and everyone in Christmas town is coming around. I’ve heard critiques of the ending, saying that Santa only accepted Rudolph after he was deemed useful, I disagree. I think it was because everyone in Christmas town was a little more open minded they were able to allow the Misfits to do what they were good at in the first place. An LGBTQ person might be a fantastic dentist, but you’d never know if you didn’t let them in first. 
So Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!! This movie means a lot to me, and I obviously really enjoy talking about this theory of mine. Feel free to comment, shoot me down, or simply proclaim your Misfitness.

(Quick note before you comment, I purposely gendered Rudolf as a boy. He's a metaphor for a trans experience, but not a representation of it.)",genderqueer,Rudolph the Queer-noses Reindeer,1481714961.0,"{'created_utc': 1481689761, 'id': '5i8kvu', 'num_comments': 11, 'score': 3, 'selftext': ""Merry Christmas! I’ve been watching Rudoph the Red-nosed Reindeer (1964) the claymation Rankin-Bass classic, and I wanted to shed some light on how I watch the movie, and how I see it as a movie about the LGBTQ community coming together and rising above the adversity we have in our lives everyday. I do not think my take on the film was the original intention on the creators (with one small exception), but I do believe the message of Misfits finding a home was. I would love to hear your thoughts and input. \n\nRudolf is born with an apparent “defect,” one could see this as a metaphor for a physical disability. I chose to think that Rudolf was born as transgender, inter-sexed or particularily flamboyant. His parents don’t take him to a doctor or seek out the advice of anyone else, they simple see the defect and immediately talk of making a “buck” out of him. They cover his nose and call him, “My normal little buck.” I have a theory that glowing red noses are something that happen at the northpole, and are just never talked about, considering his parents don’t see surprised, disappointed, but not surprised. \n\nThen we move to Hermey the elf. Hermey is gay. This is the one exception I made above, I think the creators intentionally made Hermey a gay character. One, he’s very sensitive and is the only male elf who styles his hair. This may seem like archaic stereotypes in 2016, but in 1964, these were tells. He also dreams of being a dentist, which I think is true, but there’s more than that, there’s an innate not fitting in or wanting to do what’s expected (Making toys = finding a wife, having a family ect.)  There is this small pause that happens every single time he declares his dream to be a… dentist. Hermey tries to fit in, by fixing the teeth in the dolls, but the act of trying to fit in only shows more and more of his Misfitness. \n\nRudolph goes to the reindeer games, where his parents force him to look like the other young deer. Forcing him to wear things that are hiding his grater character. This strikes me as incredibly similar to stories of parents forcing their trans children in the dresses or suits. “There’s more important things than comfort, self respect” says Donner. \n\nRudolph meets Fireball and Clarice. Fireball is just another reindeer who will be appalled by Rudolph’s true nature when he is outted during the reindeer games. These reindeer games, which seem to me like a sports team, complete with a coach wearing a whistle.  These games around about being bucks=men. The girls are just there to watch and it’s the boys, the real boys who are there to show their stuff. Rudolph preforms better than all the other bucks, but his flight is brought to an abrupt halt when his nose covering falls off and he is outted in front of the entire team. The way the other deer react, including Coach JerkFace is a nightmare (and reality) version of other people outting stories. Clarice, who declares Rudolph as “cute” right before he is outted, comes back to him insisting that his nose is what makes him special. She sings him a song that might as well be titled, “It Gets Better.” Clarice is the most open minded creature in the northpole, including Santa. \n\nIt’s Clarice’s father who ruins it for everyone and drags his daughter away from the “weirdo.” This is when Rudolph finds Hermey, and they decide to run away together. This, I think, is a metaphor for the unity among the LGBTQ community back in 1964 when we had to band together as a community in the face of all the hate. Rudolph being trans, in different from Hermey who is gay, at times those communities overlap,  but it is not always the same story. However, Misfits are Misfits, and we find strength when we find each other. \n\nEnter Yukon Cornelius, who is not a metaphor, he is exactly as written.

57,2016-12-15 16:26:43,5iifbe,3,9,"So I’ve been thinking about dysphoria a lot and I just kind of need to vent and organize my thoughts. I’d really appreciate any advice or support from other AMAB non-binary people, particularly those who have/are transitioning MtF or who have considered it.

It’s difficult for me to talk about dysphoria as an AMAB person who is also agender/gender neutral, because I have no interest in presenting myself in a conventionally feminine way (I prefer short hair and typically ‘masculine’ clothing, I don’t care for makeup, etc.), but in a physical sense I could possibly be considered transfeminine. I wish my body were less masculine, particularly my facial features. I want softer, more traditionally ‘feminine’ facial features. I strongly dislike having hair on my body; my legs, chest, arms, and I especially dislike having hair on my face and neck (though I do have an inexplicable affinity for sideburns).

Looking back, there are a lot of AFAB people, particularly those who are androgynous or masculine, who I have been attracted to in an odd sense. Though of course I found many of them to be attractive as potential partners, many other times, I was not sexually attracted to them in the way that I am attracted to someone who I want to be with, but rather aesthetically attracted to them in the sense that I just really liked the way they looked. Often I found that I envied their looks and wished that I looked like that. I’ve only recently come to fully understand this kind of thinking in the context of my own gender identity and dysphoria.

I can think of a number of ways I have felt dysphoric, but did not know how to process it because I did not desire to present very femininely. For instance, I’ve always felt more comfortable in briefs or other tight-fitting underwear than I did in boxers or naked. Now that I know more about dysphoria, I’m able to recognize why I feel more comfortable in certain underwear, when it seems like everything is kept in place, than I did when I was naked. I feel like this does for me what binding does for AFAB men (though of course, not being one myself, this is admittedly speculation). Generally, the tighter fitting they are, the better.

Sometimes I’m more or less comfortable with my male body, other days I’m not. I’m not sure if this is because I’m truly comfortable in my own body, or if I’ve just grown accustomed to seeing myself this way and knowing other see me this way. Sometimes I’m comfortable with my male genitalia, or at least not uncomfortable, but other times they just feel like they’re in the way, and I don’t really want them. I’m used to having them, I suppose, so I can’t really imagine what not having them would be like. Sometimes, I imagine having female genitalia would be much more comfortable, but then other times I’m not entirely sure.

I’ve thought about getting on estrogen and/or having surgery, but am admittedly afraid of making such a permanent change. On the one hand, even though this may feel right now, I worry I might feel differently later in life and regret it. My perception of my body and gender has changed in the past, what if it changes again? I can’t even bring myself to get a tattoo because it’s permanent; this is huge. On the other hand, I’m worried that the longer I wait to begin transitioning, and thus the longer I spend developing and maturing masculinely in this male body, the more difficult it will be to look the way I want, and I will have missed an opportunity. On top of all of that, I have to factor in the cost of transitioning and the difficulty of coming out as a non-binary person who’s transitioning – neither of which are easy things to come out as.

So yeah, that’s what I’ve been feeling. I don’t know exactly what kind of advice I’m looking for, but feel free to share anything that might be helpful.

62,2016-12-16 02:29:32,5ilst5,2,18,"So about a month ago, I vented a bit about some insurance issues. I had been denied approval for an orchiectomy and the representative of the insurance company had no-showed at the hearing.

I set down and put all of my reasoning for why the denial of my claim was flawed into an email to the representative of the insurance company. Part of me thought they'd use it to better prepare their reasoning for the hearing, but I felt like they could push the hearing back indefinitely(though I later read the comments and saw some wiser advice, but I'd already sent my hopes in an email). After a few weeks, I got an email from the representative telling me that my surgery was approved. Suffice it to say that a specific ""regulation""(not sure what the individual pieces would be called) regarding transgender health care in the Washington Administrative Code that the insurance used to deny my claim specifically mentioned nonbinary genders elsewhere in the same ""regulation"". So I am really grateful for whoever included that language in the ""regulation"".

Well, obviously, I was ecstatic. I thought about responding directly to those who had responded to my initial post, but it was weeks later and I guess I was scared they'd consider it a bother to receive a response to something after that long. Honestly, I wish I had seen the advice and responded sooner, but I didn't and, even had I seen it sooner, I'm kind of flaky. How did this paragraph turn into this? Anyway, I scheduled my orchiectomy for some time in March and sort of got back to life. I got a call about a week ago and, somehow, they had an unexpected opening today.

So I am really grateful for whoever included that language in the ""regulation"".\n\nWell, obviously, I was ecstatic. I thought about responding directly to those who had responded to my initial post, but it was weeks later and I guess I was scared they\'d consider it a bother to receive a response to something after that long. Honestly, I wish I had seen the advice and responded sooner, but I didn\'t and, even had I seen it sooner, I\'m kind of flaky. How did this paragraph turn into this? Anyway, I scheduled my orchiectomy for some time in March and sort of got back to life. I got a call about a week ago and, somehow, they had an unexpected opening today. So I got up at 4:30 this morning and went into to Seattle to get an orchi! I woke up with only the smallest amount of pain and super happy! I\'ve just felt nothing but positive all day and it is a really weird feeling. \n\nWith warmest regards,\nSera', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'Orchiectomy', 'created': 1481880572.0}"

I also go by my birth name (masculine) and while I prefer they/them I don't actually mention it unless someone asks so usually I just go by masculine pronouns.

To my knowledge, I've only ever been with cis women. Most of them straight.

It feels like the only way to be desired by queer people is to jump into the deep end of genderfuckery, which I want to do desperately but feel anxious about basically doing so by myself. I look at posts in communities like this and I look at the queer people in my life that are nothing but supportive but still feel like I'm not a part of it until I jump in and I feel unable to jump in by myself.

I feel like my gender identity does not exist in anybody's orientation. Too queer for the straights, not queer enough for the queers. It's crushingly lonely.

So in a dream I had a couple of days ago, my body and genitals were changable/fluid. Thus, I could actualize whichever body parts I desired.

(First of all, let me know if I use terms incorrectly. Still pretty new to this.) I'm AFAB, 22, bi.
A few nights ago, I had a bit of a breakdown with a friend that understands gender much more than I do. I think it's been building for a while.

I have never identified with other women from a gender standpoint. I've always felt third party, even though I really enjoy dressing femininely. I was raised female in a conservative home but felt passive aggressively pressured to cover up/not wear makeup/etc, so I haven't tried exploring my femininity until recently. I was constantly mixed up for being male until 2 years ago. I love dresses, feel most comfortable in makeup, and, even though I wrestle with body dysphoria sometimes, I am mostly happy in a female body. I'm okay with she/her pronouns, but hearing them feels...a little foreign to me. I love dressing femininely with a boyish haircut, and I like naturally having board, more masculine arms and shoulders. ([The most recent pic of myself that I'm really happy with. Someone called me handsome on Facebook and that was really nice??](http://imgur.com/ulryEPD)) I could see myself changing to androgynous pronouns later. At one point in college, I avoided seeing my whole body in a mirror for over a year because I felt so confused by it.

I think exploring my femininity is causing a bit of a quarter life crisis. I feel like I'm transitioning from basically being gender-neutral until about a year ago to being female, but at the same time, I still don't identify with other women? I feel like this femme third party that I don't know how to describe.

What is...what is genderqueer to you? Does anyone identify with this?

115,2016-12-30 12:08:51,5l34wc,6,7,"This is a bit confusing for me but let me try explain my situation.

I am 44 born as a male and diagnosed with genderdysphoria.
Currently on HRT (Cyproterone Acetate and Estrogen)
Whole my life I never experienced any problems with myself,  I never felt that I was a male, and my desire to be female was minimal.
I always had an androgynous appearance which was pretty much okay with me.     I didn't care which dressingroom or restroom I had to use,  I just use the one that draws the least attention.
Since about 5 years ago,  I slowly began to lose my androgynous look,   and started to look more like a typical male.  I was repulsed by myself and everyday I looked in the mirror and watched that face that was almost screaming the words: ""Male, Dude, Man"" at me.  My Dysphoric feeling began to develop.   I always had long hair since I was a kid,  but when I saw the thinning and my scalp shining through my hair in the middle I almost had to puke.

All of sudden I wanted everything to get rid of that horrible masculine face, in fact I wanted to get rid of everthing remotely masculine,   HRT, SRS,  FFS, facial hair removal you name it. 
After countless interviews I was diagnosed with Genderdysphoria.
And eventually started with HRT and I had multiple sessions(laser) to have my facial hair removed.

Now I begin to change,  slowly the masculinity of my face is disappearing, reverting back to the androgynous look I had,  my hair shows the very first signs of recovery.
And with it,  my dysphoric feelings seems to diminish as well.

Seemingly,  I don't have a strong desire to be a female (although I prefer that over being a male).
But I do have a very strong feeling of disgust when I look like a typical male.  

Bottom line is:   I don't care whether I am a man or a women,  as long as I don't look like a man.  As long as people are unable to determine my gender, or see me as woman. That's fine with me.

Does that make me a Genderqueer?

I have seen things about presenting qualities of both male  and female but I don't relate to this. I have seen things about ""boy mode"" and ""girl mode"" and this is what I feel I can relate my experience to. In my day to day life I present myself as male and I feel very comfortable presenting as such and identify as male, this is my ""boy mode"". I regularly present myself as a female as  well and pass quite well which is important to me and when presenting like this feel comfortable identifying as female, using female pronouns and a female name, I would feel uncomfortable being referred to with male pronouns when presenting like this, this is my ""girl mode"".

4,2016-12-06 22:38:14,5gw1gp,2,5,"I'm 30, AMAB [to use the jargon you use here - in keeping with target audience - I was born male basically], from the United Kingdom.

A long time ago [well, around November 2004 and March 2005 when I was a student] I experimented with crossdressing/androgyny but it never got very far. I did this probably to challenge my own gender norms and simply because it seemed something new [I was 18/19 at the time, and students experiment with things].

The clothes I experimented with were feminine - but only got as far as women's jumpers / crop tops / athletic wear and leggings in charity shops [they were the only places that seemed accepting of this in late 2004 / mid-2005 - back then, the term genderfluid was unknown to me]. They felt good and it was more like a feeling of comfort from the clothes - not a sexual or fetish reason.

The crossdressing was not done for any fetishistic or sexual reasons but only as experimentation.

I could be genderfluid - but although I identify as male [most of the time], I have also identified as female too [so that could probably make me bi-gender, technically]. I do have a female alter-ego as such but she has no real change from me - same interests, same sort of personality, only the aesthetic changes. In terms of pronouns - it's he for male form [as I am now], she for when female form [instead of they which is gender-neutral since I'm technically identifying as both - at least from my point of view].

My interests are traditionally considered as masculine - automobiles, computing, web design and I have traits considered as masculine - strong, active, clumsy but I also I have traits traditionally considered as feminine - sensitive, accepting, kind, gentle but I don't act effeminate or over-masculine. I'm just in the middle of those two. My day job requires the feminine sort of traits [I can't talk much about it due to Data Protection Act 2003, all I can say is it involves working with vulnerable adults].

If I am genderfluid, then so be it - it's 2016, and I shouldn't have to worry about this. OK, so I will probably look like a butch lesbian stereotype in physical terms due to my face being very masculine-looking and my hair [very masculine style] but that is OK with me.

I do worry about how this will affect my dating / relationships - I am attracted to women who are very feminine / girly-girl sort of behaviour/interests. I do not know what sort of woman would be attracted to this and for obvious reasons have never told my friends about this.

I haven't experimented much with genderfluidity really for these reasons:

- I live at home with my parents and am financially dependent on them [and they do not know, probably because it's a question of whether they need to know yet and/or I am too embarrassed to tell them].

-  My area is a fairly conservative one [near Skelmersdale/Wigan] with an older population, no LGBT ""scene"" or people to talk to on this in my area.

-  I only learnt about gender fluidity a few years ago.

Admittedly - this is experimentation with a way of expressing myself - but I am not really sure how to go about this safely - changing rooms in shops [for instance] since it is new to me.

David Bowie [who I am a fan of] presented as androgynous - but it is coincidental - this has nothing to do with me experimenting.

I know for a fact I am not transgender, but bi-gender [if that is the correct term] may be the word.

18,2016-12-30 10:39:03,5l2ufp,12,4,"Hi r/genderfluid,I had originally posted this to r/asktransgender but it didn't get much of a response. I am currently a very confused, scared and worried 19 year old male from the UK. I have been obsessing over the question of ""Am I transgender?"".  Doing so makes me feel more depressed and generally anxious but I can't really stop worrying about it because it's such a huge thing. In short, over the past few years, I have swung from answering yes and no to the question above without ever really feeling like I've got an answer. There are cases when I do come to some sort of a conclusion that I'm not trans, and for a while, I feel this sense of relief wash over me, and I feel like I finally can go on with my life. Usually this happiness and optimism doesn't last that long though before I go back to questioning. And I mean it's pretty obvious why I'm still questioning - I can't really deny the fact that I have had fantasies about becoming a woman. And from what I've read here, no cisgender person does that, meaning I must be transgender, and that sort of sends me into a panic, it's scary, and weird, this idea that I'm transgender. And the cycle kind of goes on.
My problem is that I don't feel like I fit the category for cisgender, but I don't really feel like I fit the category for transgender either. I kind of feel half-trans and half-cis, though I know it doesn't really work like that haha. I'll try and give some examples. I've seen the idea that I might be genderfluid suggested a few times so I wondered if this resonates with anyone here.

As I've said, the biggest thing suggesting that I am trans is that I've had fantasies, exciting fantasies, about becoming a woman. Most of the time, these are sexual in nature, but if I am being honest to myself, I know there are times when it has not been just sexual. Instead, these fantasies can make me feel happy or calm. Even when the stories are sexual in nature, I've noticed the most exciting parts for me are when a male character experiences some detail that only a real woman could feel or experience. In particular, I have once or twice felt a particular thrill when imagining myself as an actual girl - i.e. imagining I was born as a girl or something. I haven't had any obvious dysphoria - physical, social, to the extent where it was kind of self evident - but looking back on my teenage years, and even in my recent past, there is this mild sense of something not feeling right - kind of not feeling like a real person, a bit depressed, just going through the motions. Sometimes I've thought that my personality, shy, generally a bit more feminine than other guys in terms of not being aggressive, being a bit more caring and kind, might have made me a 'better' girl than a boy. So sometimes being a girl would mean I would have less pressure on me.

All of this makes me sound pretty trans. But I'm confused by the other side of it. Essentially, if I could sum it up in one sentence, it would be that on the inside, there is at least part of me, if not most of me, that feels like a guy. I don't mean this in a bad way at all, but in a good way. I mean this in the sense that I feel like a really important part of my identity is that I am a guy. And sometimes, I feel more in touch with this guy part of me, and I start feeling good about myself. I start feeling like more of a real person again, it's almost like I've remembered who I am. As a kid, I never had any transgender feelings, I was just living as myself, and I was happy, and when I feel like I described above, I feel like a kid again, happy, optimistic, looking forward to the future. And it's stuff like the fact that I like to look good as a guy - the better I look the better I feel about myself. Like for example I like male clothing. I feel like if I was trans then I wouldn't actually care how I looked as a guy, because it wouldn't make me feel better. Sometimes, when I look at the changes that HRT brings on timeline and stuff, I think about how I would feel weird if those changes happened to my body. Sometimes in the mirror my body looks to have a bit more a feminine shape and I don't really like how it looks. And I think about my current life, about the elements of it that are determined by my gender, like how I interact with people, and I think I quite like it. I mean, thinking about it, I genuinely like parts of being a guy. Like, how a relative might say that I'm looking handsome, or talking to a girl as a guy, as opposed to what I imagine its like talking to a girl as a girl. The thought of being a father in the future, as well, is a nice one. What I'm kind of saying is that this isn't just a superficial thing, I feel like being a guy has some deeper significance for me.
The other big one is fantasising about sex - like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, which I have done, it is very arousing and exciting, but never at the end really satisfying, but when I fantasise about having sex as a guy the fantasy seems so much more real (if that makes sense), like I'm not even fantasising about being a specific sex, I'm just imagining having sex as me, and that's easier and more emotionally satisfying to fantasise about. Like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, I'm just imagining the fantasy, but fantasising about sex as a guy is all about imagining the fantasy actually happening in real life. When I'm in this state of mind, thinking of myself as more manly really turns me on.

The part where this gets really complicated is that I don't know if I'm just saying this stuff to stay in denial - I mean, I think I do genuinely like being a guy, but maybe I would try being a girl and I'd realise I'd love it, that all of the above was just some lie to myself, and that I'd never want to go back. Sometimes it feels inevitable that I'm going to be transgender, which I guess might mean deep down I know I'm transgender, and I'm just trying to avoid it. I'm a bit scared of that happening to be honest, maybe because I think it could happen, though obviously if I did love it I would be happier, which is ultimately what I want. Then again, sometimes I feel at peace and happy when I'm a guy, and the idea that I'm transgender doesn't worry me at all - I just feel secure as a guy. I just feel right. But all this second guessing and doubt makes it impossible to get an answer.

So as you might have guessed I'm kind of all over the place and I've done a lot of thinking about this. I feel like a very divided person, like parts of me are wrestling with one another. I don't really know which of my thoughts or emotions I should listen to. And this is just really messy, especially when you consider all the different things like what actually is identity, reality vs. fantasy, denial etc. so I feel overwhelmed a lot of the time and it gets me down (though writing it out has helped a bit.) I'm kind of just wondering if anyone had been in my situation and found an answer that has given them peace. I really just want to be at peace and be happy, and have an explanation for all my feelings and stuff. And yes, I know, I should look for a therapist, but I'm it very hard to actually make myself do it - maybe because doing so would force to me to acknowledge there is a real issue here for me to address. I guess what it kind of comes down to, in part, is that if I came to the conclusion that, in light of all the evidence, I was transgender, I would be kind of freaked out about what it would mean for my identity. I feel like it would screw all of that up and I don't know how I feel about that. And I kind of feel like while the idea of being a girl is exciting and part of me, if I lost my male identity, I wouldn't really feel grounded in reality, I might not feel like 'me' anymore.

Any responses appreciated.",genderfluid,Do I sound genderfluid?,1483119543.0,"{'created_utc': 1483094343, 'id': '5l2ufp', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 4, 'selftext': 'Hi r/genderfluid,I had originally posted this to r/asktransgender but it didn\'t get much of a response. I am currently a very confused, scared and worried 19 year old male from the UK. I have been obsessing over the question of ""Am I transgender?"".  Doing so makes me feel more depressed and generally anxious but I can\'t really stop worrying about it because it\'s such a huge thing. In short, over the past few years, I have swung from answering yes and no to the question above without ever really feeling like I\'ve got an answer. There are cases when I do come to some sort of a conclusion that I\'m not trans, and for a while, I feel this sense of relief wash over me, and I feel like I finally can go on with my life. Usually this happiness and optimism doesn\'t last that long though before I go back to questioning. And I mean it\'s pretty obvious why I\'m still questioning - I can\'t really deny the fact that I have had fantasies about becoming a woman. And from what I\'ve read here, no cisgender person does that, meaning I must be transgender, and that sort of sends me into a panic, it\'s scary, and weird, this idea that I\'m transgender. And the cycle kind of goes on.\nMy problem is that I don\'t feel like I fit the category for cisgender, but I don\'t really feel like I fit the category for transgender either. I kind of feel half-trans and half-cis, though I know it doesn\'t really work like that haha. I\'ll try and give some examples. I\'ve seen the idea that I might be genderfluid suggested a few times so I wondered if this resonates with anyone here.\n\nAs I\'ve said, the biggest thing suggesting that I am trans is that I\'ve had fantasies, exciting fantasies, about becoming a woman. Most of the time, these are sexual in nature, but if I am being honest to myself, I know there are times when it has not been just sexual. Instead, these fantasies can make me feel happy or calm. Even when the stories are sexual in nature, I\'ve noticed the most exciting parts for me are when a male character experiences some detail that only a real woman could feel or experience. In particular, I have once or twice felt a particular thrill when imagining myself as an actual girl - i.e. imagining I was born as a girl or something. I haven\'t had any obvious dysphoria - physical, social, to the extent where it was kind of self evident - but looking back on my teenage years, and even in my recent past, there is this mild sense of something not feeling right - kind of not feeling like a real person, a bit depressed, just going through the motions. Sometimes I\'ve thought that my personality, shy, generally a bit more feminine than other guys in terms of not being aggressive, being a bit more caring and kind, might have made me a \'better\' girl than a boy. So sometimes being a girl would mean I would have less pressure on me.\n\nAll of this makes me sound pretty trans. But I\'m confused by the other side of it. Essentially, if I could sum it up in one sentence, it would be that on the inside, there is at least part of me, if not most of me, that feels like a guy. I don\'t mean this in a bad way at all, but in a good way. I mean this in the sense that I feel like a really important part of my identity is that I am a guy. And sometimes, I feel more in touch with this guy part of me, and I start feeling good about myself. I start feeling like more of a real person again, it\'s almost like I\'ve remembered who I am. As a kid, I never had any transgender feelings, I was just living as myself, and I was happy, and when I feel like I described above, I feel like a kid again, happy, optimistic, looking forward to the future. And it\'s stuff like the fact that I like to look good as a guy - the better I look the better I feel about myself. Like for example I like male clothing. I feel like if I was trans then I wouldn\'t actually care how I looked as a guy, because it wouldn\'t make me feel better. Sometimes, when I look at the changes that HRT brings on timeline and stuff, I think about how I would feel weird if those changes happened to my body. Sometimes in the mirror my body looks to have a bit more a feminine shape and I don\'t really like how it looks. And I think about my current life, about the elements of it that are determined by my gender, like how I interact with people, and I think I quite like it. I mean, thinking about it, I genuinely like parts of being a guy. Like, how a relative might say that I\'m looking handsome, or talking to a girl as a guy, as opposed to what I imagine its like talking to a girl as a girl. The thought of being a father in the future, as well, is a nice one. What I\'m kind of saying is that this isn\'t just a superficial thing, I feel like being a guy has some deeper significance for me.\nThe other big one is fantasising about sex - like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, which I have done, it is very arousing and exciting, but never at the end really satisfying, but when I fantasise about having sex as a guy the fantasy seems so much more real (if that makes sense), like I\'m not even fantasising about being a specific sex, I\'m just imagining having sex as me, and that\'s easier and more emotionally satisfying to fantasise about. Like when I fantasise about having sex as a girl, I\'m just imagining the fantasy, but fantasising about sex as a guy is all about imagining the fantasy actually happening in real life. When I\'m in this state of mind, thinking of myself as more manly really turns me on.\n\nThe part where this gets really complicated is that I don\'t know if I\'m just saying this stuff to stay in denial - I mean, I think I do genuinely like being a guy, but maybe I would try being a girl and I\'d realise I\'d love it, that all of the above was just some lie to myself, and that I\'d never want to go back. Sometimes it feels inevitable that I\'m going to be transgender, which I guess might mean deep down I know I\'m transgender, and I\'m just trying to avoid it. I\'m a bit scared of that happening to be honest, maybe because I think it could happen, though obviously if I did love it I would be happier, which is ultimately what I want. Then again, sometimes I feel at peace and happy when I\'m a guy, and the idea that I\'m transgender doesn\'t worry me at all - I just feel secure as a guy. I just feel right. But all this second guessing and doubt makes it impossible to get an answer.\n\nSo as you might have guessed I\'m kind of all over the place and I\'ve done a lot of thinking about this. I feel like a very divided person, like parts of me are wrestling with one another. I don\'t really know which of my thoughts or emotions I should listen to. And this is just really messy, especially when you consider all the different things like what actually is identity, reality vs. fantasy, denial etc. so I feel overwhelmed a lot of the time and it gets me down (though writing it out has helped a bit.) I\'m kind of just wondering if anyone had been in my situation and found an answer that has given them peace. I really just want to be at peace and be happy, and have an explanation for all my feelings and stuff. And yes, I know, I should look for a therapist, but I\'m it very hard to actually make myself do it - maybe because doing so would force to me to acknowledge there is a real issue here for me to address.
