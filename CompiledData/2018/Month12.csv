Which is kind of sweet, but there are some concerns.

First off, I'm OUT I dont edit my identity for my partner's family and they're confused but fine with it.  They misgender me and deadname me on accident but mostly it just annoys me, they're ignorant but not transphobic.  However my partners grandfather is an avid trump supporter, but mostly because hes one of those folks who thinks trump is a good businessman and will help this country. He's wrong but hes also old as hell so I'm not going to bother trying to change his mind.  He isnt racist (but he also isnt a poc ally) and hes not homophobic or transphobic  (but hes also not really doing anything to educate himself either).  I also just get weirded out by him because my cultural upbringing interprets most of his body language as very direct and intimidating, but I also know friendly shoulder and arm touching and direct eye contact are common American things.  I guess there are a lot of things he does that make me a *little* uncomfortable but not enough for me to peg him as someone I dislike.

So, now that hes started saying these things I feel anxious about family gatherings because I dont know when he gonna ask me for ""the talk"" and I also dont want to take the initiative on this.  Hes very tech savvy for a 70 year old man, he made his own PC so I am 80% sure he could just google trans issues.  Which makes me think he wants to know why *I specifically* am trans and that's a lot of pressure.  But I also know if I just calm down and talk to him we might be closer which is nice because I love my partners family.  I just hate being vulnerable.

What I want to ask is: do any of yall have advice or anecdotes about talking to elder family members about this stuff? I do want to help him get educated I just loose confidence when talking about my own personal experiences with the family because I haven't had a good life and I dont want them knowing that.

56,2018-12-04 12:49:06,a30dx0,11,1,"I've been going to a physiotherapist because I have very stiff muscles in my shoulders and back (keep that in mind, because that might carry weight in this situation).

I started wearing a binder two months ago, and got increasingly more pain under my armpits and beneath my shoulder blades when I did. Sometimes my ribs would ache as well. Since I've started practicing my posture accorting to how my physiotherapist recommended, all of that is gone!

I gathered my courage and told my physiotherapist about my issues, and where they stem from (luckily, she was totally great about everything!)

She explained what was happening as follows:

when there is pressure on the front side of the chest (which is true for binders), the back muscles pull your shoulder blades down (aka, your lower back is more arched, and your shoulders also pull back as a result). Which involves all of the muscles that were painful for me: the ones beneath my shoulderblades, the ones below my armpits, and even the muscles across my ribs (flanks) that ached.

What she told me to do was this: when wearing your binder, feel the pressure on the front side. Your first instinct will be to push back against that, and start breathing high in your chest. Don't do that, because it'll make everything even more painful.

Instead, try to feel the band beneath your shoulderblades on your back (I guess where the bra strap would've been). And while breathing, focus on that area. Feel it, and feel that part of your chest expand. So instead of breathing high in your chest and fighting against the pressure, seek the room in the back. I personally wear gc2b binders, and those are stretchy in the back, so I have lots of room to breathe there! It made perfect sense once I started breathing like that.

Then continue to check in every once in a while to see if you're still breathing correctly.

Doing this for just one week has helped me tremendously, and has me wearing my binder happily for 8 hours a day, while I had trouble wearing it for more than 3 hours before that.

I hope this helps some transfolk out there, and please share this with anyone who might benefit!

I've had issues talking about these sorts of things previously and my dad has flat out admitted that he ""Doesn't believe in dysphoria"" and them not believing in my sexuality but I really want them to accept me not being female.

75,2018-12-05 05:21:21,a3972l,4,1,"Hi. Sorry

A lot of stuff is happening all the time and I should be asleep rn, but I need some help. 

I know about the things. Nonbinary, gender fluid, demi boy, demi girl, agender, but then there's new stuff like neurosis and things. I don't know what to do because I feel like I need a name for how I feel- not for my identity, but just something to.. anchor on? Its so late and I'm so tired

The skinny: a fat AFAB. I'm 23. I recently cut off all of my hair in a panic, and the stylist at the LGBTQUIA friendly salon I went to kind of picked up what I was putting down and gave me a rad, intense undercut with just enough hair on the top to pass with a pixie if I'm at work. It's kick ass. That was my second step. My first step- after a dissociative panic attack- was telling my husband that I don't know forreal what my gender is and a traumatic event forced me to question a lot of stuff. 

[TRIGGER WARNING] something kind of traumatic happened to me recently- in october i got a positive pregnancy test and the reaction other than sheer horror was pure revulsion at the capabilities my body had. not only is being pregnant incredibly medically dangerous for my parts, its dangerous for me mentally. I had to terminate before I started experiencing serious, life threatening complications, and my hormones went all over the fucking place and I freaked out rly bad. My psych gave me mood stabilizers and now i have to see a therapist biweekly, but we have to tackle the big stuff before we do little things like my gender

But now I am stuck. I have already ""came out"" to two people, but now I need better words. 

HEre's the thing: If I could build my perfect body, I would be 5'7"", stocky, strong, and not fat. I would have incredibly small breasts that I could cover with a binder whenever I wanted. I would have innie parts, but I would suppress my menstrual cycle and be sterilized. I would have a strong jaw. My hair would always be incredibly short. My clothes would depend on how I felt, I would still get piercings and tattoos and have a horrible sephora problem, but that's it. I don't care what people call me, because I am a body and I put things on the body and it should have no bearing on me as a person. They/Them feels awkward, She/Her I'm neutral to, and He/Him makes me feel squeaky. 

Being told who I am isn't the goal, but some kind of inkling or validation that the way I feel is real, and that other people experience it, and that there's a name for it would help me feel less like I'm faking how I feel. I'm so terrified of being accused of being like, trendy-trans? Idk I saw the word on reddit the other day and I am horrified at the idea of someone thinking being more neutral in my life is like me being a cis woman coming up with a for funnies identity and then go back to being safely cis with my also gender-non-conforming husband. there has to be folks who feel this way",NonBinary,I need to figure some things out and the internet is too big,1544012481.0,"{'created_utc': 1543987281, 'id': 'a3972l', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi.

I am also conducting online interviews on the lack of media representation for non-binary individuals and how it might affect body satisfaction. All interviews will be conducted via an instant messaging app, and will only require typed responses. No personal data will be kept. Interviews will take between 30 minutes to 1 hour and will form part of my dissertation.¬† The interviewer will ask you questions like ‚ÄúDo you think the media changes the way you feel about your body?‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo you feel represented in television media?‚Äù.

90,2018-12-05 20:51:45,a3gg50,2,1,"Hello and thanks for reading! I've been lurking this sub a bit, and it's been very enlightening. However, I keep questioning my gender identity, and I'm beginning to think I'll never understand that part of myself. I was wondering if anyone has any similar experiences or thoughts on the following:

I've been playing with gender nonconformity for years (before I knew I'm bi/pansexual), so I'm very certain that my gender expression is varied. (I'm AFAB and I've worn men's and unisex clothing, participated in drag events, dressed as male characters for cosplay, etc.) Yet I know that expressive activities are separate from identity and may have nothing to do with it. But I am having trouble teasing apart the external influences from the internal feelings. 

For example, I've definitely internalized our culture's body shaming and have a negative self-image, so how can I know if my occasional thoughts about being able to switch up my body (like having smaller breasts or none when I want that) is just another form of self loathing? I've read that many cis people long for body changes as well, so I feel like I can't know my motivation. These feelings are also not persistent and I'm generally able to go about my day without thinking about my body too much.

Another example is when I am dressing in a more masculine or androgynous way, I feel like I can't know if my motivation is to be read as a butch woman, a nonbinary person, or a man. I know I've felt a pang of something when I was dressed more masculine and I asked friends if anyone would think I'm a man and they said it's obvious I'm a woman. But that could be disappointment at outfit failure. I know how I want to dress on any given day, but I don't know why. 

I also can't seem to tease apart my avoidance of the male gaze from my deemphasis on femininity. I don't shave, I don't show off my breasts with padded bras and low cut tops, and I'm often uncomfortable when men are perceiving me as an object or in a sexual way (in high school this manifested as me identifying with ""ugly""). Is my dislike of being overly feminine reactionary to the male gaze or is it related to gender identity?

On the other hand, when I think about not identifying as a woman, I get nervous because I really love women! Saying ""I'm not a woman"" makes me feel like I'm expressing internalized misogyny. I've grown up around heterosexual cis women who prioritize male attention and deprioritize female friendship, so backing out of that identity feels like I'm betraying women. Another aspect of that is that, with my body, I'm always read as a woman and have experienced sexism based on that outward appearance, so I have some particularly formative experiences in common with women and I feel like shared hardships form social bonds.

Another complication is that I've seen cis people online asking some of the same questions I've been asking myself, like ""what is it like to feel female because I just feel like myself?"" And it's because they don't feel incongruity between their identity and appearance. So I feel like if I can't determine if I'm feeling female, it's because I'm cis.

My boss and I were discussing correcting coworkers about my pronouns and she said something that made me kind of uncomfortable. She said that maybe the reason why some people may have problems using my pronouns because they feel as though they're calling me an it. At the time I was kind of mortified so I just kind of nodded or something but I'm mad that I didn't say anything now. 

One of my friends at work whom I really love otherwise was having a hard time remembering in particular. I had a brief one on one conversation in which I explained I wasn't mad but please could she use my pronouns correctly. She apologized and agreed to try to remember.

I was explaining that part of the reason I took the job was because being misgendered over the phone all day was effecting my mental health. she was like..."" You know this is a problem you're going to have your whole life, right?"" And was talking about how I couldn't be hurt by things like that and how she wish she could learn more sensitivity from me and I could take on some of her toughness.

112,2018-12-06 19:22:59,a3r97d,4,1,"Hi all,

I was AMAB and I'm strongly considering starting HRT but as I'm not a binary trans woman, I feel like I probably wouldn't want such a high dose, and I'm curious what sort of effects I could see at a lower dose. My principle source of dysphoria is around my hair: I've got a lot of hair on my body and I'm starting to lose it on my scalp. It's crushing because while my ideal presentation is more andro, baldness and body hair is almost always clocked as male. 

On the other hand though, my junk doesn't really give me a lot of dysphoria and I'd like it to keep it's factory standard functionality, so to speak. I've had sex with a binary trans woman and that gave me some perspective on the phenomenon of girl dick. From that experience, and from what I've read from many trans women who have penises, the function of penises changes pretty significantly with HRT. 

So I guess my question is twofold: first, how does a lower dose of HRT effect body and scalp hair? If I take antiandrogens that should slow/stop the hair loss, but will my scalp hair regrow on a low dose of estrogen or do I need high doses to do that?

And second, will low doses of HRT change my penis's functionality? 

Obviously YMMV for everything but I'd like to hear other people's perspectives and experiences to come to informed decisions.

I see it all the time, I've done it, but it seems almost compulsory here and other nonbinary subs and forums to state your assigned gender at birth in almost any introduction or conversation. I looked at a lot of posts where it shows up and see some recurring reasons that break down into a few common categories:

&amp;#x200B;

**QUESTIONING**

* Questioning being trans/nb (""I'm \[AGAB\] but think I might be nb for these reasons..."")
* Not feeling ""enough"" of assigned gender, questioning whether that makes me trans/nb/agender, etc.
* Does being gender nonconforming mean someone is nonbinary? (stating AGAB and gender nonconforming traits)
* Previously identified as binary trans, maybe nb? (Sometimes state AGAB, sometimes binary trans gender or both)

**DYSPHORIA**

* Issues of presentation and expression (too much like AGAB stereotypes, not enough like nb stereotypes, etc.).
* Clothing questions (specifying body type/sizes/dress codes)
* Specific body dysphoria issues based on anatomy.
* Validation (""is it ok that I do this even though my AGAB is \_\_\_? Do I pass?"").
* Socialization (specific gender issues related to upbringing, change in context around old behaviors, etc.).

**MEDICAL**

* Types of medical transition/HRT/surgeries (seeking answers to specific questions about treatments or procedures).
* Diagnostic criteria for specific ailments by biological sex (disclosing AGAB to doctor, etc.).

**SEXUALITY**

* Conflicts with partner's orientation (""I'm \[AGAB\] and my partner is \[orientation\]"")
* Questions about orientation related to transition (""I'm \[AGAB\], can I label myself \[orientation\] even though I'm nb?"").

**SAFETY &amp; INCLUSION:**

* Looking for role models (""Where are all the \[AGAB\] nonbinary people like me??"")
* Exclusion/Inclusion (""I can't find any nonbinary oriented resources for this \[AGAB\] issue"", ""I'm nb, but take up this cause because I'm \[AGAB\]).
* Gender segregation (""There's no binary option and I'm being sorted by my AGAB"").
* Bathrooms (a million versions of this, forever and always)

&amp;#x200B;

All of these categories and examples have valid reasons for getting into someone's AGAB. I have done it myself for many of these reasons and I'm not saying it's never relevant to a conversation to disclose one's assigned gender at birth. Just that so many of these things don't really require us to disclose it and it could be inferred from context if it's actually necessary to understand what's being discussed. If someone is seeking validation, we can validate them without needing to know ANYTHING about them, because every one of us is valid and many of us know those insecurities and how to address them, regardless of AGAB. In other cases, like medical issues, just asking the question directly usually leads to being pointed to relevant and helpful info. If we're discussing issues related directly to someone's assigned gender and their specific issues that are springing from it, it makes sense to disclose it and discuss it (especially when it comes to discrimination, gender segregation, exclusion, etc.). If someone is asking specific questions about the effects or particular hormones or what the recovery time is for a specific surgery, it's usually implied and the relevant answers/experiences can be given without having to state our AGAB. Presentation and anatomy don't equal gender, so we can talk about fashion and anatomy issues without having to disclose every single time, most of us are going to get the context and be able to discuss the issues just fine.

&amp;#x200B;

When we get past these most typical reasons, it seems like it's just a compulsory disclosure. Something like ""Hi, I'm a 25 y/o (AGAB) nonbinary person from Ontario, what's up my enbies?"" and that just seems straight up like making a binary for nonbinary people. I get clocked as my AGAB every day (much to my displeasure and dysphoria), so I really don't want to always automatically put that into the head of someone who can't see it. Maybe other people feel differently about that, I certainly wouldn't begrudge them using gendered language (demi\_\_\_, binary pronouns, etc.) to describe themselves. I just don't like the automatic practice of stating our AGAB and creating a second tier binary, when I've already had that gender assigned to me and enforced on me my whole life. I don't find binary genders to be negative, I just find my experience with being labeled with the one I was assigned to be negative and I don't want to keep attaching it to myself, if at all possible. I understand we all have different backgrounds, issues and challenges, but that's true even within people who are the same assigned gender and nonbinary. We're going to have different experiences with dysphoria, goals for transition, social interactions, orientations, expressions and feelings about ourselves and others in any case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Have I missed something? Am I just plain wrong? I'd love to get some different points of view on this. More of an issue of trying to deprogram myself from automatically defaulting to binary language and concepts, not trying to scold anyone or make anyone feel bad for doing it.

171,2018-12-10 00:07:58,a4qbo2,2,1,"hi all!

thanks to this subreddit I've gotten a lot of good info and support here (posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/9ywtnm/did_other_folks_here_not_at_all_question_your/) earlier) and I'm in my phase of gender questioning where I'm starting to embrace the idea of having a Non-binary identity internally, and thinking about slowly starting to come out as either non-binary, non-binary/woman, or gender-questioning to my friends and family.

I'm an AFAB and I've presented as pretty feminine for the majority of my adult life, and having recently come out as bisexual I've started feeling more comfortable dressing a bit more masculine and I probably present as tomboy-esque or an athletic girl who loves Levi's but not necessarily looking obviously androgynous or masculine (although that's my goal internally).

I cut my long hair (was previously about boob length) into a short bob thats about an inch above my chin and my friends and family have been really supportive of my new look. I really love having shorter hair because it makes me feel more tomboyish and like I'm presenting less feminine, but not necessarily pushing the boundaries too boldly all at once, and I wanted to see in a more gradual way how it felt to have shorter hair.

Now that I know I feel really good having shorter hair, I am thinking about the idea of cutting it even shorter, I really love the look of 90's short ""curtains"" type hair style ([see Winona Ryder circa 1992](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/77/8b/a8/778ba82a4740e246ecc86b8856a9a2ae--short-hair-cuts-short-s-hair.jpg)and [Leonardo DiCaprio](https://90sthrowback.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/ldicaprio07_gl_17aug12_rex_b.jpg)) and I like that both men and women wore that hairstyle but it is more of a masculine look IMO.

I was chatting with my mom this morning about my new bob haircut and how she really likes it short, and she was telling me stories about how when she was part of the new wave scene in the 80s her and her friends all had short ""boyish"" hair. I half-jokingly said ""sometimes I think it'd be rad to go full Britney and shave all my hair off"" and she said ""please don't do that"" and that she'd be ""disappointed"" if I ever did because she said she thinks I look really cute and she likes my hair.

The comment hit me more than I expected. It made me feel that coming out as non-binary would be harder than coming out as bisexual to my parents. Even though they are relatively progressive and support the LGBT community at large, her comment made me feel that a lot of her conceptions of me are constructed around the idea that I am her ""daughter"" and all the gendered connotations that come with that, and that coming out as NB might really be a lot for her to handle. Her and my dad have been \*super\* supportive of me since coming out as bisexual, I didn't feel like I had to explain myself or that it changed their view of me at all, but after hearing this comment it made me feel like I would disappoint them if I came out as non-binary or wanted to present more masculine because it made me feel like their idea of me as NB as opposed to ""their girl"" would completely change their view, even though \*I\* know fundamentally I am the exact same person.

Being in my mid-20s with a career and having graduated college already, I normally might not care this much about how my parents might think, but I recently had to quit my job due to a toxic work environment, and I'm living with them right now while I look for new work, and I might be home for a few more months. I don't necessarily \*want\* to put off cutting my hair and other external ways of exploring my identity until I move out, but after hearing my mom's comment I feel like I might have to.

I guess I wanted to hear if other folx on this subreddit have experienced similar situations, where your parents aren't overtly shitty like kicking you out of the house or something, but maybe make passing micro-aggressive comments that make you feel uncomfortable or like you're disappointing them? How do you reconcile their feelings of disappointment with exploring and asserting your gender identity? Did anyone's parents change their mind or come around to being fully supportive after awhile?

I feel so bad not because I don‚Äôt like being non-binary or I wish I was cis or whatever, but because I hate creating awkward situations, as I‚Äôve always been socially anxious. I used to work retail and after I cut my hair short everyone would read me as a guy and then I‚Äôd speak and they‚Äôd immediately get all flustered and apologize and all this and I would just feel like crap.
Issue is, since society isn‚Äôt going to be changing any time soon, I either need to work through my social anxiety and present how I want, or transition to a ‚Äúmasculine presenting‚Äù appearance and live out the rest of my life presenting as a man, once I graduate college of course...and I‚Äôm not upset with that, I can see myself finding happiness in that future, even if it‚Äôs not what I truly want.

Although  many transgender / non-binary people say that being misgendered is a major source of  stress for them, there is very little research about misgendering. This  study is investigating the ways that people are  misgendered, how these events are similar to and different from one  another, and the impact they have on trans / non-binary people‚Äôs well-being.  Participating in this study may help researchers develop more effective  ways of reducing misgendering.

To be in this study you must:

* be at least 18 years old
* be a fluent in English
* be transgender (including non-binary or genderqueer people)
* have experienced misgendering at least once

Because  other scientists have not done very much research on this topic, no one  has developed multiple choice questionnaires about it. That means this  survey will ask you to give your responses to several questions by  typing your thoughts in sentences. **Most participants will find this is easier and more comfortable to do on a device that has a keyboard.**

This study is expected to take about 20 minutes to complete but this may vary depending on how much you choose to write.

For every complete, unique submission, I will donate $2.00 to TransLifeline, up to 100 participants.

194,2018-12-11 04:51:50,a53p1o,7,1,"Hi there,

I'm an elementary school teacher (cis female) in a fairly progressive district, and I would really appreciate some help in navigating a situation. I hope it's okay to post here. 

My school has always done a ""gender lunch"" (their words!) with the 5th graders, where they separate them into boy and girl groups to talk about social challenges. I do feel that it's been valuable for a lot of kids, but I also feel that it could potentially be harmful for any students who are questioning their identity, in any capacity. 

So I offered to lead an alternate group that was open to all students, so that they don't feel compelled to go with the group based on their assignment at birth. But I also want to phrase it in a way that doesn't make students feel like they have to make a statement about themselves before they are ready, and so that it is available to a larger group.

I guess the main issue here is that I both want to keep it vague enough for all students to feel comfortable, while also wording it in a way that subverts the binary language and recognizes a spectrum. Could I introduce it as a ""gender neutral"" group without making kids feel like if they come, they aren't singling themselves out? I don't want to say ""mixed group"" because that is exclusive of students who might not identify as either male or female.

I'm hoping to hear from anyone who is willing to share what would have been helpful for them as a 10-11 year old.

A year ago I came out as trans, started taking testosterone (afab) and changed my name/pronouns to masculine ones (in Portuguese we only have gendered language, yay) and went full on r/FTM, but then I started having anxiety attacks and stopped taking T and started to doubt myself.

226,2018-12-12 06:52:50,a5frh1,0,1,"Hey, I had made a post vaguely similar to this a while back but just wanted to follow up after some introspection.

So my gender expression is what most people would consider masculine. I wear men's clothing usually, I don't keep my face clean shaven, etc. And unavoidably, aspects of how I've been socialized lead to some of my traits or behaviors being what one might consider masculine as well.

However, I've always thought that's pretty restrictive. I mean, I also like dresses and nail polish and cute things, and I have a pretty nurturing &amp; empathetic approach toward others, which are traits traditionally lumped in with femininity. Right?

I think I stick with masculine presentation because, well, I'm AMAB so this is easier and usually more comfortable. And honestly if I could dress however I want I'd be wearing a cute dress one day and jeans and flannel the very next day, but I'm absolutely terrified of the social repercussions that would come from that.

To get to the main point, at some point I decided to self-identify as non-binary, but since I look so much like a man it was difficult and confusing for everyone, so I tried to force myself to be less ""male"" to offset it and it just stressed me out. Eventually I felt maybe it would be easier to just say I'm something like demimale so people can call me ""him"" if it's such a big deal to them &amp; I won't have to explain myself to them. But I keep just flip-flopping between thinking ""maybe I'm just a weird man &amp; I should just accept it"" and ""no, I don't think I'm a man or a woman and 'they/them' pronouns make me happy.""

So I guess I have to wonder, am I really non-binary, or am I just a cis man who doesn't like the *roles* or *expectations* associated with being a man? I'm not exactly consistent about it, so it almost makes me think I'm just some cis person who for some reason really wants to be treated as gender neutrally as possible or something?

In general, I think the best advice is to be kind and compassionate to yourself. Cut yourself some slack when things get you down, allow yourself to feel that this is you, that you get to define your feelings and that your feelings are valid. Because they are. Maybe you don't feel that you are reacting in a socially acceptable or 'correct' way, but they are your reactions and your feelings. Take the time to have them before you try to analyse and understand them. Otherwise they become bottled.

Maybe you already have coping strategies, maybe you already have an end-point in mind, maybe you don't. Whatever, research and learn - about the situations you can face and about yourself. Look into how others cope with it. Protect yourself if you have to - so don't do research at work or where others may track what you are doing. But do research. Seek out safe spaces to discuss your feelings on matters.

Maybe doing something that feels affirming will help you out as well. My friend and I created a short documentary film that asks some of these questions to a gender-non-conforming musician and how music and spirituality has played a vital role in their process of dealing with gender dysphoria.

235,2018-12-12 15:57:26,a5jdi0,0,1,"So today two people in a server I'm in, started a rant about transgender people.

One of the people claimed that trans people are trying to erase the term ""Tomboy"" without any source but one article with obvious trans misinformation.

The other person was upset that trans people asked others to RESPECT their pronouns, and they claimed that people are forcing their beliefs onto them. He continued to then mock and dismiss trans people...before being muted.

The pronoun boy got (only muted) for 24hrs...not banned or anything. And the reason he got muted was not because he was being transphobic...but because he was ""arguing"" 

The ""Tomboy"" person later got into my Dms, trying to explain their perspective, in which they provided an extremeist article and said ""in the liberal age, media is working overtime to kill the word 'tomboy'""

I said that one article doesnt represent a whole generation/media. And that ""I can name a number of people who support trans boys and tomboys who aren libral cucks""

They replied ""Lin, can you stop posting from your emotions. That's not how civil discourse works""
In which I said that nothing they've said has been an actual fact. (Which is true. They never said anything that was true at all especially on a statistical scale.) 

Me: You dont know what trans people want on a ""societal scale""

Have you spoken to more than one trans boy in your life? Have you seen any trans movements go ""Down with dam tomboys yer all evil!""

You do know there are tomboy trans girls right?

Them: you mean tomgirl? Jfc (In which he's assuming trans girls are boys who are femme...and not just girls)

Me: No. Tomboy.
Gender expression isnt gender?
Tomboy is a girl who likes predominantly male shit. Trans women aren't men. Wtf?

And this is where they blocked me. Though before they commited the action they said ""Okay Lin, I don't think you came here for a conversation. I think you came here for a monologue. If you want a monologue, you can have it. Goodbye.""

I had a conversation. 
You came to me.
You started this making baseless claims.
You basically called trans women male and
YOU went out of your way to paint me as insane despite aside from a few curse words, me being very reasonable and civil.

I‚Äôm a mostly-cis person (AMAB, masculine presenting) with little or no gender-related dysphoria. My only source of dysphoria relates to my genitalia. Specifically, my body has male genitalia, but my mind expects my body to have a vagina instead. (That's why I say mostly-cis; there's one thing that's definitely not cis.)

A few items: no, I‚Äôm not concerned I‚Äôm a trans woman in denial. I was open to that hypothesis, but I‚Äôve been through plenty of therapy and ruled that out. Also not concerned that this is misunderstood dysmorphia; it‚Äôs a case of genital dysphoria. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt like what I have, it‚Äôs that my mind expects one thing and there‚Äôs an entirely separate thing in its place. This leads to considerable anxiety, and on bad (dysphoria-related) days it‚Äôs unbearable. 

I have a supportive therapist who thinks that bottom surgery would be appropriate as a way to treat the dysphoria, and while I have some misgivings related to cost, risks, etc., I generally agree with her. As such, I‚Äôm strongly considering (currently seeking referral to a surgeon to do a consultation) bottom surgery. However, I‚Äôm in a relationship with a gay man.

&amp;#x200B;

In July my boyfriend asked me if I wanted to be a man because I looked like I was ""hiding my boobs"" and at this time I genuinely thought and explained to him that I just didn't feel like I'm a man nor a woman. He was confused about this, but he was accepting of it, nevertheless I really tried to sugarcoat it and told him that it is completely fine to still use feminine pronouns for me (since we are speaking a very heavily grammatically gendered language without practical options for genderneutral terms) because I was so worried about losing him. I mean I'm still not too picky about what people call me but lately I'm just feeling more and more dysphoria about not just having an amab body. I just look at other guys in my age and all I see is how much I wish I had their body shape and could just been born as one of them. On other days I'm more ok with how I look and feel like I should just accept myself and try to work with the things I have.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, I just feel more and more like I am lying to myself about how ok everything is and about how I'm fine with being the girlfriend and daughter. I can't relate at all to wlw content but I feel this strange connection to mlm couples. The worst thing about this is probably that I am terribly scared about this because my boyfriend, who I genuinely hope to marry in the future, is very much heterosexual and just can't see himself dating anyone beside a woman. He even asked me if I felt like I'm a man, because he would totally want to support me but he couldn't date me anymore because he's just not attracted to men. I mean that's fine. I can't tell him that he can't be straight just like you can't tell gay people to not be gay, because that's very rude and uncalled for. But it hurts so badly to think that I might never be able to completely deal with it because I will lose the man I genuinely am in love with for over 5 years now if I do so.

262,2018-12-13 16:15:29,a5uw7x,3,1,"Hey! I have lately been questioning to what extent I should identify as non-binary, and I figured it might help to discuss the relevant points here.

I go by she/her(s) and it/it(s) pronouns, and I have questions about my binarity along axes naturally associated with each. (Relevant background information: I am AMAB and out/hormonally-socially transitioning as a trans woman, though that is going worse than I would prefer.)

**Regarding ‚Äúit‚Äù pronouns:**

A lot of people I see explaining their preference for it/it(s) pronouns insist that they cannot give any interesting account of what they like about them: they are simply the pronouns that feel best. This is not the case with me. I very much enjoy being thought of as a sort of instrument or device or engine for producing my academic-intellectual work. My joke is that I am a machine for converting junk food into philosophy. This certainly is not a way of being binarily gendered, but neither is it really an expression of *gender* dysphoria; it‚Äôs something more like mode-of-being dysphoria. So I don‚Äôt know to what extent this warrants being called non-binary.

**Regarding ‚Äúshe‚Äù pronouns:**

I really, really like being a girl. I like being a girl (I think) as such: I do not think that I am euphoric about certain personal and psychological dimensions of mine having values that place me within the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù range; I have little notion as to what this would even involve. The desirability of girlhood is primitive‚Äîor at least so it seems. 

And yet... I consistently find that I am uncomfortable with a lot of even very basic aspects of fem presentation. The thought of wearing a bra or makeup makes me wince, and the thought of looking in the mirror to see someone indistinguishable from a Typical Cis Girl in bodily appearance and presentation, while preferable to that of seeing my current testosterone-fashioned reflection, still sounds like looking at myself in a costume. The one time I tried getting a fem-ish haircut, looking in the mirror became difficult. (More so than usual, that is.)

I also think I experience straightforward genital euphoria about my dick. The thought of waking up to find a surgeon had covertly given me free MTF SRS sounds horrifying: the body I would have would in some visceral sense be *not mine*.

There‚Äôs also the matter that my gender euphoria is specifically euphoria (I think) about *trans*femininity. I sometimes think, when I‚Äôm being consistently misgendered, that it might have been worth it if given the choice, Myth of Er-like, to be born a cis girl, just to avoid this intense dysphoria about masculinity. But I still seem to consider it a *cost*: being a cis woman would be, as such, a bad thing for me, a misfortune. And indeed, the moment of despair usually ends fairly quickly: it would *not* have been worth it to be born cis and AFAB. 

But on the other hand... I worry that I am conflating gender dysphoria with preferred manner of female presentation, or being female with having a vulva rather than a penis, or being a woman with being a cis woman. I don‚Äôt know that any of this indicates as such that I am not a binary woman.

****

Anyway, that is the long and short of my situation. It sounds nice to be an enby: androgyny is super cool and hot (ugh, horrible pun not intended but very much apologise for); I get happy thinking of showing off the non-binary flag; and I usually feel more political, cultural, and personal kinship with non-binary trans people than the sort of arch-binary ones one can find on certain mainstream trans subteddits.

I had to prove that I've gone through a sex change (even though I haven't) to get 'Male' on my ID, even though I'm not male. I showed them 5 different letters from my doctor until they said, ""Okay, I GUESS we'll accept this,"" and let me take the photo for my new ID. Then, I had to talk to someone else and they saw that I wrote 'trans and nonbinary' as my reason for my name change.

""That's great! You keep being you, sister!""

Wait, sister? But they saw that I'm trans... They must have.

""Hey, you don't have to mark male on the gender section. We know you're a woman. It's okay!""

Woman? Then, it hit me. They thought that I was a trans woman. 

""No, no, I'm not... I'm not a woman...""

""Honey, it's okay! No judgement here!""

""Look, I appreciate that you're so accepting, but I'm not a woman.""

Then, they just stared at me. This wasn't the first time someone had confused me for a trans woman.

Chee and Shoo are just two things I thought of off the top of my head, the words could be anything. I do, though, have a story for how I came up with chee and shou. 

By having unique words it would prevent problems regarding grammer. This could also assist in international adoption when being translated into other languages.

In brackets are my words I made up that could be used in a singular fashion and removes confusion when saying something like ""(chee)they went to the bathroom"".

Or ""have you seen them(shou)"" as it still implies multiple people when ""them"" is used. This would likely assist with adoption the into mainstream as more people would likely be inclined to accept a new word instead of redefining something that has long been accepted as a plural way of identifiying a group of persons.

so im fourteen year old person who feels like they have dysphoria (or dysmorphia), let me get specific skip over if any  
mention of vague amab trans related body discomfort (in italicize) might be a trigger of stress or other unneeded/unhealthy mental health issues;

*-hips; 24/7 i feel a huge discomfort in my size of my hips or lack there of*

*-face; 24/7 as well i get a huge discomfort in the way my face can be persevered as masculine when i want more androgynous way*

*-crotch; i feel that at my genitals at times are not mine, not as ""oh i feel like i need a bigger package"", but ""i dont want my genitals to be male, and sometimes no genitals for that matter,""*

*-hair; 24/7 on my dads side my family is known for very hairy bodies, i am dark haired so the hair on my arms, legs, chest, armpits, ect. stands out more predominantly then another persons hair might be. when i first shaved my arms one month ago my family all asked why and my mom said, quote ""dont do it agian its weird, do you want to be known as the one haired man?"" even though she knows my hair is a large discomfort.*

*-hands and feet- once every day i know this is weird but every day when i look at my hands (or feet when bare foot or in sandals) they feel like im looking at someone else doing what im thinking and is a traditional manly man with testosterone and car oil coarsening through his veins.*

*-adams apple; 24/483784 every day i look at my neck and see this bump a nonexistent bump that i cant see but feel when i run my hand up my throat to see if somehow it dispersed*

*-socialyl; 24/7 words like; sir, handsome, manly, boy, man, son, nephew ect and my birth pronouns; he/him give me great distress and discomfort when directed at me. and would prefer they/them pronouns and less gendered names and expressions to be used for me.*

OKAY for anyone who made it this far I say thank you, so now here is a couple of questions that have been in my head for a while and by no means do I want you to answer all of them at once, but to figure out who i am could you possible answer one of them?

1. how could an a.m.a.b nonbinary person start to transition to a more androgynous body type
2. any small ways to make myself feel feminine or androgynous while not outing myself to family and friends
3. possible people who are (or were) in my similar situation that i could research and use as a ""role model""
4. how to figure a name that is less gendered then my birth name
5. and how to slowly integrate hints that i might not be in the gender norm at all into my friends and family mind

a little more backstory.... sorry.

at this time i am out as gay to all others besides my dad (other family as well as friends)

has dressed in old giveaway clothes my sisters were giving away when no one was home (dresses, heels, and bras)

have been wanting to grow out and paint my nails

have wanted to wear makeup outside of theater and sometimes hallowen

have told 5 people i want to use they them pronouns and identifies as something outside of the label of male.

22 AFAB, come to realise that I relate to the nonbinary label due to meeting and dating some AFAB NB people and coming to some realisations, such as realising that I've been experiencing some dysphoria over my chest/general femininity for a long time.

Honestly being called she/her does not make me super uncomfortable, I'm used to it at this point and I'm more androgynous than masc, but I prefer they/them. So the right language is being used, and so people won't make assumptions about me. I'd also like to go by a more neutral name, quite similar to my birth name.

However, I don't want to 'cause a fuss' by doing this, because I don't feel like I'm uncomfortable enough to justify the issues it would cause. I have supportive friends, and my mum would be supportive, but I know for a fact a lot of people would think it was a ""snowflake"" attention type thing, and I don't want to deal with their reactions. :( My dad and stepmother don't believe in gender identities outside the binary.

I'm even worried about telling an AFAB NB person I'm dating that I prefer they/them pronouns, in case they felt like I was appropriating their identity (even thought they obviously won't). I feel like I must not be NB enough for it to be worth it or for people to believe me and that I'm not just attention-seeking, if that makes sense.

I've identified as non-binary for about a year (I'm afab) and have been going by a different name and using they/them pronouns but I'm not sure if I want to transition medically. I don't think I want to go on hormones and idk about top surgery, I wish I knew I didn't want it but I'm not sure and I'm so wishy washy I figure I just won't ever do it just in case I regret it, so I guess I end up thinking what's the point of my identity? I try to present androgynously because of my dysphoria, but I'm always going to be seen as a woman and treated like a woman so I wonder why bother with having a non-binary gender identity if it doesn't ""change"" anything? Idk I found some terf and gender critical subs that really got to me and I haven't been in a great headspace because of it.

367,2018-12-18 19:05:20,a7e2sp,7,1,"So...lately I've been feeling more on the non-binary side of things. What started triggering these feelings was by picking up a book with two people who had backgrounds in living and being taken as women who were often confused for men and who began to feel, through their own experiences and conclusions, felt that they didn't identify with either male or female and were most comfortable as identifying as they/them (Gender Failure by Ivan Coyote and Rae Spoon, in case anyone was wondering). 

That resonated with me a lot, particularly in their stories of growing up. I'm...a pretty masculine woman. 6""3, gender-neutral birth name, built like a rugby player, and because of my size I wear a lot of unisex clothes. And because of all of the above, I have often been confused for a man, or simply gotten the question ""are you a boy or girl"" a LOT. I used to be hurt by it and correct the person, but eventually I gave up and started answering by shrugging and walking away. 

But here's the thing, though. There's a part of me that can't help but wonder if I'm being pushed towards the middle because of experiences like this and not because of a strong relation to the non-binary identity. It almost feels like that because people see a big question mark when they see me that I'm wondering if I should just, you know, say fuck it and embrace it, become essentially what they say I am. 

Another factor I'm wondering about is mental health. I gots depression, anxiety, and PTSD and, without getting into huge details about it, a lot of self-hate stemming from bullying and lifelong emotional abuse. As a result I sabotage myself constantly and try to minimize my presence as much as possible. So I can't help but feel if identifying as non-binary might be a bad-lizard-brain subconscious desire to erase any distinctive attributes to my existence, which is TOTALLY wrong and not good in the slightest, both in terms of my self-hate and of what being non-binary actually is.

I don't know...I don't know what I'm asking here. I've just been internalizing this battle in my head and I just needed to get it out into the void. Thanks for reading, anyone who did.

And to be clear, I'm working on me to figure this out. In therapy for mental stuff and working on various presentations to see how the hell I feel. I have a lot to work out.

But yea, is it possible to ... get these results from a super low dose? And if so... is any healthcare/doc/therapist going to OK me if it's not toward eventual full transition?

So I think the vast majority of us on this sub would agree that sex and gender are completely separate entities, right?  I personally also think that a person could identify as nonbinary and be completely comfortable with their birth genitals.  Further adding separation to gender and sex.  So if that person is completely fine with their body and how it is seen, can there also be nonbinary people who their gender is nonbinary but they feel their sex is not correct?  

For example, an AFAB nonbinary identifying person feeling their gender is, say, agender, but feeling that their sex should have been male?  So they medically transition to have male genitals but still feel they are a nonbinary person gender-wise?

Sorry if this is confusing, it's hard to figure out how to articulate my question. Also I'm kind of old so I apologize if some of my terminology may be outdated.  Feel free to correct me to more appropriate language in comments.

412,2018-12-21 01:34:22,a850fa,2,1,"In two weeks, I will be seeing an endocrinologist about possibly starting hormones.  My hope is to start on anti-androgen and see how that feels, and then decide whether I want to start estrogen later.  The doctor I am going to see is in a big medical practice with a lot of different kinds of specialists.  I actually already go there to see a different endocrinologist for my thyroids, as well as a general practitioner (but I go somewhere else to see a psychiatrist).

&amp;#x200B;

I am somewhat concerned that I might run in to some sort of gatekeeping before I can start hormones.  I don't know anything about the doctor I am going to see beyond what is on her public profile, so my worry may be completely baseless, but that doesn't stop me from worrying.  I have known there were some things I really disliked about my body for a long time.  However, it didn't really occur to me until about a year ago that it might be gender related.  I'm 24, and I can easily imagine some people saying that that is too old for me to ""suddenly"" realize that I am trans.

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time, I've known that I really hate having hair on my face, or chest, or in my crotch.  Also, I hate erections, and I'm not fond of balls.  On the other hand, I'm really not sure how I would feel about having breasts.  That's part of why I want to start anti-androgens but am still unsure about estrogen.  

&amp;#x200B;

Between 5th and 7th grade, I had very long and very thick hair.  I started puberty late, so during that time I was also very short, had a high pitched voice, and no facial hair.  People my age who I met for the first time usually viewed me as a boy, but people my parents' age usually assumed I was a girl.  At the time it didn't really bother me one way or the other, but it agitated my parents to no end.  Nowadays I don't think I could pass as a woman or even really androgynous, due to my voice and the shape of my body.

&amp;#x200B;

Though I don't really feel comfortable with gender roles, there is one male stereotype that I have completely embraced: I do not like thinking about clothes.  I don't like shopping for clothes, or trying them on and having them not fit, or picking out which clothes I am going to wear in the morning, or making sure the clothes I am going to wear are washed and dry.  I want clothes that keep me warm, but aren't too hot, don't itch, cover up the parts of my body that I hate, don't restrict my movement too much, and have pockets.  And I don't like thinking about having to find clothes that do all of those things.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also frustrated by the fact that ""men's"" shorts and occasionally ""men's"" long pants are the only pants that have big pockets.  Even skorts that I've tried after hearing they supposedly had ""big pockets"" have small pockets in comparison to ""men's"" shorts.  I am somewhat afraid that my decision to continue wearing men's clothing could lead someone to say that I'm ""not trans enough"" to get hormones.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried wearing false breasts both at home and outside (but not at work), and I feel fairly neutral about them.  But, then, I need to wear them with a bra, which is an extra article of clothing that I have to think about.  With my body shape and size, I have been unable to find any strap bras that actually fit.  I have found a few sports bras that sort-of kind-of fit me, though.  

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow, as I said at the beginning of this post, my fears may be completely baseless.  I may walk away from my appointment in two weeks with a prescription for anti-androgen without any fuss.  And even if I don't, I have the means to go to another doctor's practice, albeit it will involve more unpleasant delays.  I really just wanted to vent right now.

That\'s part of why I want to start anti-androgens but am still unsure about estrogen.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBetween 5th and 7th grade, I had very long and very thick hair.  I started puberty late, so during that time I was also very short, had a high pitched voice, and no facial hair.  People my age who I met for the first time usually viewed me as a boy, but people my parents\' age usually assumed I was a girl.  At the time it didn\'t really bother me one way or the other, but it agitated my parents to no end.  Nowadays I don\'t think I could pass as a woman or even really androgynous, due to my voice and the shape of my body.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThough I don\'t really feel comfortable with gender roles, there is one male stereotype that I have completely embraced: I do not like thinking about clothes.  I don\'t like shopping for clothes, or trying them on and having them not fit, or picking out which clothes I am going to wear in the morning, or making sure the clothes I am going to wear are washed and dry.  I want clothes that keep me warm, but aren\'t too hot, don\'t itch, cover up the parts of my body that I hate, don\'t restrict my movement too much, and have pockets.  And I don\'t like thinking about having to find clothes that do all of those things.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI\'m also frustrated by the fact that ""men\'s"" shorts and occasionally ""men\'s"" long pants are the only pants that have big pockets.  Even skorts that I\'ve tried after hearing they supposedly had ""big pockets"" have small pockets in comparison to ""men\'s"" shorts.  I am somewhat afraid that my decision to continue wearing men\'s clothing could lead someone to say that I\'m ""not trans enough"" to get hormones.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have tried wearing false breasts both at home and outside (but not at work), and I feel fairly neutral about them.  But, then, I need to wear them with a bra, which is an extra article of clothing that I have to think about.  With my body shape and size, I have been unable to find any strap bras that actually fit.  I have found a few sports bras that sort-of kind-of fit me, though.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyhow, as I said at the beginning of this post, my fears may be completely baseless.  I may walk away from my appointment in two weeks with a prescription for anti-androgen without any fuss.  And even if I don\'t, I have the means to go to another doctor\'s practice, albeit it will involve more unpleasant delays.  I really just wanted to vent right now.

The past year or so we've lived in different cities so my (already light) social life basically disappeared. Luckily, through the people I knew (again through friend one) I've been able to get regularly booked for shows and other art stuff in town (i'm a musician). 

A friend of a friend had been following me through shows and posts about my shows and explicitly stated she wanted to be my friend bc she liked my vibe. It was great on so many levels. 

Firstly, she was so upfront about wanting to be my friend and know me more. No guesswork! üòÉ And since she knew me through my special interests (music, performance, fashion, art in general) she would always engage me based on that! 

Secondly, I've been struggling with gender identity and my almost exclusively VERY video-game-dude-bro str8 guy friends were causing me a lot of dysphoria. Not because of anything they do or say to me - they're actually great &amp; part of our larger social circle which is largely LGBT - but when I'm with them I'm seen as a dude just like them and I end up acting that way because of involuntary masking. 

This new friend - Ill call her Sunny - immediately acknowledged me as someone who is NB and very femme. One of our first long text conversations was just us trading looks from The Met Gala and talking about what we think of them. She invited me to a party and there she introduced me to some more of her girl friends and included me in planning a girls night! 

Since then we've been dropping compliments on each other's selfies and we've had another outing to THE LIBRARY!! (nice n quiet!) and a park (doGS!) and she was into it when I wanted to just watch a turtle for a bit. 

And she also has anxiety so we've been able to connect over that! 

I'm so used to feeling excluded (often unintentionally) by the people I want to be around due to either my low social energy and awkwardness or because I'm not seen as ""one of the girls"" (usually it's not the girls who don't want me around; it's the guys not wanting to be around the girls and wanting/expecting me to come with them) and I'm just feeling so valid right now as both a non binary individual and as an autistic adult and I'm excited for the future!

I made/am maintaining a friendship by myself for the first time in my adult life. It's a scary adventure and I don't know how people do it and it's great.

Quietly in the past year I've started to identify as non binary sometimes. I'm biological female, and I don't want to be a man, but I've always felt somewhere in between.

I've never been keen on wearing a bra and I don't think I've worn one in over eighteen months. However, right now I am feeling particularly dysphoric and couldn't stand the idea of wearing a bra.

However I feel like it might be sending a wrong message with men in my community. Recently one propositioned me. I set him right but today I caught him staring at my bust, and realised later that the shape of my nipples were showing through.

Argh i wish I'd never been through puberty. But yea, any suggestions? I need to appear decent enough to not seem suggestive, but I can't handle a bar or even a training bra i don't think. And it's summer here right now so layers not an option.",NonBinary,Need to Appear 'Decent',1545471456.0,"{'created_utc': 1545446256, 'id': 'a8h23e', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Hi there\n\nQuietly in the past year I've started to identify as non binary sometimes.

458,2018-12-22 03:41:15,a8hidr,3,1,"I don't know what my body is supposed to look like, but it's not this.

Right now, that's all I know. I look at page after page of pictures under the ""androgyny"" tag, and I see what I wish my body looked like. They are all white, they are all thin, they are all delicate and fragile. Their tits are small, their hips are narrow, their faces have jaws and cheekbones that could cut glass. Their eyes are huge and deep, ageless. They look like elves or angels, and I want to look like them, and I never, ever will.

That's not self-loathing, that's not pessimism, that's straight-up fucking biology. I am five-ten and burly - not six-two and willowy, not five-four and curvy. I am 190 pounds of soft muscle and hard fat. I have never broken a bone because my bones are as thick as tree limbs, my wrists too large to grip in one hand. My ass is big and firm but not shapely. My thighs are horselike with no gap in between, my arms are strong but too soft for any muscle definition. My tits are big but partly because my chest is thick, barrel-like - it gives me a deep voice and makes me pop buttons on shirts when I breathe, in a way that is not sexy and scandalous but just embarrassing and expensive.

Looking at these pictures makes me feel exactly how I've felt all my life - slow, clumsy, misshapen, as if I'm interacting with the world through a spacesuit. Most days it feels like I can't truly touch anything, like every motion is a fumbling approximation of what I intended, like every sense is dull and muffled. When I look in the mirror I can see myself in the eyes - well, not in them, but behind them. The eyes aren't shaped right, they're not the right color, they're not mine, but behind the face I don't recognize I see my own fear looking out. That's been the same all my life. I can't ever remember seeing a face in the mirror that looked like mine.

Right now, it feels like it's the having of a face at all that I resent. I spent today looking up local ordinances on the wearing of masks in public. I'd like to assemble a collection of beautiful masks, all different, that I could choose from when I go out and wear all day. I hate the feeling that participating in daily life requires taking a stand on who I am as a person. I would like to go out in a voluminous robe and a mask, so that what I say and do is just what I say and do, not what a WOMAN says and does, not what a MAN says and does... I do not want to be assigned a category and I don't want to prop one up by existing. But it seems that I don't have a choice. There is no way to opt out of people looking at you and assigning you a role based on the first fucking characteristic they see.

Thirty years of first-person gaming and silent protagonists have taught me that the essential ME is in my hands. They're the only part of myself I like. They're the only parts of me that look exactly like they should, the only parts I enjoy watching do what they do. They're neither masculine nor feminine, and they're not pretty - I bite my nails and chew my fingertips until they bleed. But none of that matters when they're writing, or cooking, or drawing. All that matters is that they're sure and strong and they've never failed to do as I asked.

I've always talked to people best when we walk side-by-side, not looking at each other. I've always done best online, in text, where my voice doesn't interfere with what I have to say. I don't want to have a face. I don't want to have a voice. I just want to bring the quest item and turn it in, and be judged on the basis of how well I did the thing.

It's hard to see a way out of dysphoria right now. I can't think of any shape within my physical capacities that I would like better than the one I have. I love having long hair and I love having tits, but I could take or leave the bottom system if I'm honest. I want to have a baby and do mom things. I want to be a knight, too, but I'm not sure if it's for the sense of purpose or the armor.

460,2018-12-22 08:32:33,a8j9im,7,1,"I'm AMAB and currently identifying as non-binary. I'm 19, and since I was 14/15, have been on-off identifying as NB. 

To list the reasons I feel NB:  


I get social dysphoria. I hate being called a ""man"". I get extremely uncomfortable being grouped in with men.I hate having male gender roles pushed upon me. I hate being called ""handsome"". I love, on the flip side, being called ""beautiful"", ""cute"", ""pretty"", ect. The social dysphoria can get to the point it makes me depressed enough to cry or very irate. This is the only way to instantly ruin my mood and make me extremely upset.

I get what I assume is physical dysphoria. I absolutely loathe my body and facial hair. I'm slender, but I know if I started bulking up and developing a more masculine frame, I'd hate it.

I looooove having long hair. (Not that men can't have long hair! I just know with me it's partially because it adds to making me look androgynous/less so masculine.) I hate having short hair.

I know gender expression and identity are two separate things, but it's worth mentioning I'm a very feminine person. 

I hate masculine clothes. The only clothes I've ever felt comfortable in are androgynous styles. Men's clothes often accentuate the masculinity in my frame and make me hate my body.

I'm at my happiest presentation wise when I'm androgynous. I love the idea of people not knowing my gender from a glance. There were times in my life that I was confused for female even, and that made me happy. I felt androgynous because of it.

I like to do drag, and it goes beyond performance art for me. It feels AMAZING, euphoric, even. to look in the mirror and see myself, in feminine/androgynous clothes, makeup that feminizes my face/makes it androgynous. 

Lastly, I just don't feel male. When I think of myself I often see myself as not belonging to any gender wholly. When I see men, I just... don't feel like I'm the same as them? I'm not ""one of the guys"", nor do I want to be.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons I don't feel valid:

&amp;#x200B;

I still find that despite belonging to either category, that, if you drew a line, and put male on the left end, and female on the right end, then put your finger in the direct middle, and moved slightly to the left, that'd be where I'm at. 

I like he/him pronouns.

I'm more comfortable in a male body (ideally an androgynous one, but whatever)

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like, because I'm a bit closer to male on the spectrum (even though it's really not by a lot), and the that that means a part of me is still male, that I'll never be a valid NB person.

 I feel like, at the same time, I am not male, nor female, and experience a mixture of both, neither, and something completely different.

So that bit of background aside, my birth name is Gwyneth. I always thought this name was so pretty and also uncommon to the point that it almost feels as though this name was destined to be mine in a sense lol. It means ""happiness"" in Welsh and I really like to internalize that meaning. 

I like the idea of shortening it to Gwyn because that's a boy name in its country of origin, Wales (at least, according to baby name sites, since I'm an American and don't know any better otherwise). 

But in the interests of having my gender validated, I'm willing to part with my name. So I ask, has this happened to you? If so, what did you decide to do in the end? To any Welsh enbies -- have you heard of any boys named Gwyn?

1. Ironically, my first introduction to the NB gender was a DoseOfBuckley video(I was at a horrible genderist anti SJW phase back then), in it he argues, ""why can't you just be a guy who's into makeup, nail polish and sports"" or something like that. I think he's saying why can't you just be a dude who's into masculine, feminine, and/or in-between and still be called a guy/gal. What is your counter argument to this?

2. While watching NB videos, I saw this one about a person who claims they were AFAB and then a trans male and then as a NB. They then said, ""If I was born male, I would be happy"". Being AMAB, I displayed often feminine traits but I also did things society has accepted to be male oriented. Sometimes, if I was born female, I would've been NB at some point(funny enough, I did had dysphoria about being female when I was 13). But I also noticed some trans people talking about potential in successful surgery of a man getting vaginal parts(or the other way around). Which gives me the question, if hormone therapy(or surgery) could advance to the point where people can successfully identify as a new gender and sex(ones that fall under male and female), would NB as well as the other genders be considered of no use anymore(not saying that out of hate against the multiple genders, I'm just curious)?

3. Since I'm AMAB, a lot of my family and peers has used he pronouns to identify me. I haven't told them I'm NB yet, and I don't want to, because I feel like it could cause a lot of confusion and chaos amongst them since they accepted this genderist idea of only 2 binary genders. It doesn't help either that most of them are likely transphobic. Despite this, I want any newcomer I come across with to use they pronouns instead. Are you in a situation similar to this?

I don't expect much, but I want to give them a chance. And most importantly I want them to find out on my terms.



&gt;Dear Mom and Dad,
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I have to explain something to you about myself, because it is very important to me and I am going through changes that have distinctly improved my life, happiness, and sense of self. ¬†¬†I know you care about and love me, and I want to be authentic and honest with you and all the other people I care most about. 
&gt;
&gt;For several years now I have been quietly questioning my identity and reflecting on the ways I view myself and how I would most like to interact with the world. ¬†I have come to the conclusion that I am gender non-binary, which means that I don't fit into fixed male/female definitions of gender. I also am transfeminine, meaning that although my personal sense of gender is not entirely female, overall my identity is more feminine than the male gender I was assigned to at birth.
&gt;
&gt;My gender does not inherently change anything about who I was or am, apart from the name, pronouns, and terms used to describe me and talk about me. In being honest and open about my gender I am not changing anything about who I am, but only trying to be more authentically myself in all my relationships. What clothes I choose to wear or how I present my body is an expression of fashion and personal taste and not an indication of my gender.
&gt;
&gt;This year I have started taking hormone replacement medication and this has done more good for me in a few months than any changes I have tried to make in the past several years. ¬†I feel much more in touch with myself and who I‚Äôm meant to be. And I have chosen a name for myself that better reflects who I am. However both of these parts of my transition have not changed who I am, because this is who I always was, even if no one could see it with their eyes.
&gt;
&gt;Here are things I need you to know: ¬†I do not feel comfortable being referred to by traditionally male pronouns (he/him/his/himself), but ask that others refer to me as they/them/their/themself. ¬†I also ask that you use gender neutral terms for me whenever applicable, such as ‚Äúchild‚Äù instead of ‚Äúson‚Äù and so on. If you‚Äôre unsure about what terms to use, you can ask me and I am happy to help. ¬†I understand that these changes for how to talk about me may be confusing at first and it will take some time to adjust, especially when it comes to my chosen name; but what matters most to me is the willingness and effort to learn and use them.
&gt;
&gt;I would love and appreciate your support, however I know what the LDS faith tells you about gender. ¬†I will neither go out of my way to persuade you of what you should believe nor will I argue with you about my validity. ¬†I am aware there are narratives your church has for how I ‚Äúbecame‚Äù this way; I unequivocally reject all of them. I sincerely hope that you will come to look past what others have told you your child should conform to so that you may see me as I truly am. Transitioning is not something I started lightly, nor is it something I was tricked or deceived into doing; it has taken me over four years to reach this point, and I have talked to multiple therapists and doctors about it. ¬†Again, this is not a matter for debate. I will not tolerate abusive behavior, bad faith, or contentiousness about my identity. I am not telling you what you have to believe, but I am telling you where my boundaries are. The choice to transgress those boundaries is yours alone. How I respond to breaches of my boundaries is mine.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I know this all may sound strange and uncertain; it‚Äôs completely normal to experience strong emotions when a loved one transitions, but this is important and necessary to me. ¬†Therefore I ask that you take some time to carefully consider what I've written and how you would like to respond, and to first respond back via letter or email before we talk directly. ¬†I am not expecting this to be easy for either you or me. But if you are willing to act in good faith towards me, I am willing to hear what you have to say.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Love,
&gt;Your oldest child

I've only dated one person, pretty briefly, in the past year and a half (about the same length of time I've been coming to terms with my gender dysphoria). Lately I've been feeling suuuper ready to jump back out there and flirt, cuddle, and slut my way all over town, gender be damned, just be my honest weird self and let my confidence intoxicate, only... in real time I have no confidence. I basically can't be attracted to someone without feeling intimidated by and inferior to them. As much as I've gained in self-acceptance and embracing uncertainty, I still don't think I deserve to be wanted, at least not by anyone I also want. This weekend I skipped a party where I knew a crush would be, delayed inviting a cute neighbor to my own party so they'd be less likely to be available, and made myself too anxious by doing those two things to be open or playful in conversation with anybody new.

Gender shouldn't be an obstacle for me on paper, since once upon a time I used to be with people of many genders and orientations. And I'm not sure it's *the* obstacle per se, so much as thinking about gender amplifies my general self-doubt, and self-doubt looks uglier on me than a wrinkled sweater on a naked mole rat.

525,2018-12-24 06:41:36,a92ndw,6,1,"Hi, 

I am masculine nonbinary. I identify as something that is not really a man or a woman (androgynous), but tend a little towards the masculine side I think because I am more comfortable with 'he' and more of the secondary male sexual characteristics(still not all of them) than female. 

I started transitioning to male by taking testosterone, and for the first few years this went pretty nice, as there was still a good deal of androgyny retained while I could still pass as 'he'. After about 3 years on it, I started feeling dysphoria the other way, such as feeling my face is too masculine, and having women hit on me, which I discovered I really don't like at all (I'm asexual/but this possibly has something to do with my gender, too?) Also my hair is falling out, which, if in a male pattern would completely obliterate any possibility of ambiguity and my hair is one of the main ways I express this ambiguity, so I really don't feel like I could feel ok without it. Also I was abused by someone with male pattern baldness, so I would really like to not be reminded of that every time I look in the mirror. It's pretty much not an option for me, I've realized. To complicate things further, having more estrogen than testosterone in my system makes me drastically more vulnerable to severe states of depression, even if you don't factor in bodily dysphoria and the social aspect of it. I've tried lowering my dose of t; it still tends to rapidly cause depression, even if it's lowered slightly, and I really don't think lowering the dose would stop the changes I would like to stop, only slow them down. For these reasons, I am considering going off T entirely. I can probably find ways to deal with depression or increase my masculinity, such as working out my upper body and keeping my body fat percentage low,  but I can't get my androgynous hairstyle back if it is lost. I also can't deal with other things that cause the masculine side of the dysphoria....its a bit harder for me to pin point than the feminine side of it but its very real. So...

I'm thinking of stopping T. I know it's going to be hell, but I already have a beard and top surgery and naturally have very small hips. I also am a very small person, usually perceived as 'delicate' and 'extra feminine' somehow purely due to my size when not on T. I don't know how well I will still pass, but I would figure I would still be viewed as at least androgynous. The main thing that really freaks me out is the depression, body fat redistribution if I put on weight (seems to be fairly manageable if I stay very thin - like not emaciated anorexia thin but pretty damn thin - don't know how maintainable this is my whole life ) Anyone have any insight or possible alternatives? I've tried certain products to prevent mpb but it either irritates my scalp and makes my hair fall out, or is more feminizing in certain ways (like at the hips) than my endogenous estrogen even is, so it's pretty intolerable. I feel like if I could stop T and at least be seen as ambiguous most of the time and not purely feminine, then I could be ok and find some way to deal with the depression. I feel so frustrated trying to feel comfortable in my body and I feel like there will never be a time when it will just be ok. ",NonBinary,Stopping T?

I'd prefer the scars to be placed elsewhere, depending on what I end up being eligible for either peri (which I'm probably not a candidate for), fish mouth (the scars are higher than DI), or ideally lollipop (small vertical scar). I'm struggling to find people who actually do anything other than peri and DI, apart form Dr. Scott Mosser in California. Problem is I live in Ireland - it would be easiest if I could get someone in Europe who does the surgery, while I wouldn't mind traveling to Canada as I have friends there,  I'd prefer not to travel to the US for it. I'm expecting to pay out of pocket regardless of what I do, as for several reasons I do not want to go to the one person who does it in the country I live in. I probably wont be able to get the surgery done for a few months to a year, but I want to know who to go to so I know how much I need to save and what kind of preparations I'll have to make. I've been looking around for hours without finding much useful info.

Have any other non-binary humans done top-surgery that isnt peri/DI? If so, I'd much appreciate hearing about all the details of who/what it was like/how it worked/costs/results/etc. Or even if there are resources to help that I've missed out on.

I'm non-binary and want top-surgery, but I don't really want the standard double incision method. I'd prefer the scars to be placed elsewhere, depending on what I end up being eligible for either peri (which I'm probably not a candidate for), fish mouth (the scars are higher than DI), or ideally lollipop (small vertical scar). I'm struggling to find people who actually do anything other than peri and DI, apart form Dr. Scott Mosser in California. Problem is I live in Ireland - it would be easiest if I could get someone in Europe who does the surgery, while I wouldn't mind traveling to Canada as I have friends there,  I'd prefer not to travel to the US for it. I'm expecting to pay out of pocket regardless of what I do, as for several reasons I do not want to go to the one person who does it in the country I live in. I probably wont be able to get the surgery done for a few months to a year, but I want to know who to go to so I know how much I need to save and what kind of preparations I'll have to make. I've been looking around for hours without finding much useful info.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHave any other non-binary humans done top-surgery that isnt peri/DI?

616,2018-12-27 01:50:08,a9up8v,5,1,"Hi, long time lerker. On mobile. TL;DR at the bottom.
I wanted to share my little victory today because i can really use some nb support right now.

I've identified as nonbinary for a year now, and recently my dysphoria has been off-the-charts bad. Like, to a point where even leaving my room is difficult (bc strangers and even my own parents dont see or accept me as nb). I dont have any nb people around me, so I've been trying to handle the dysphoria on my own, which has been a huge struggle (there's only so much self-care you can do, bc strangers will still misgender me anyways).

My dysphoria triggers anxiety/depression as well, which doesnt help.

But today, i finally got the courage to make phone calls to get help. I got my health care straigtened out so I'll still be with the same primary care doctor (Im over 26, so i had to find my own health care and my job doesnt provide me one bc thats the nature of the job), and they gave me a phone number i can call to get hooked up with a psychologist/therapist/etc.

(Since im a highly sensitive person and an introvert, this hour of calling several places is all i can muster up the energy to do today, but) i took the first step into getting help with my dysphoria/possible transition (HRT, etc).

I still don't know if/when i want to do HRT or surgery, but getting my foot in the door has relieved my stress a lot.

After saying that, though, I have some questions for nonbinarys who have started transitioning: what steps did you take to get on T and get breast removal surgery? I've been struggling to find info on how to get going with these, so if you could offer me insights, i would appreciate it! 

TL;DR my dysphoria has been super bad; i finally made some phone calls to get started on getting help with it. Questions: what did you have to do to get started on T and/or breast removal surgery?

637,2018-12-27 20:01:57,aa2mel,10,1,"Hi lovely people,

I thought I'd make my first proper post on this subreddit because gender concerns have been taking up so much of my headspace lately and I'd really like to get some of it off my chest. I'm an AFAB who came to the realisation about four years ago that I have never identified as a woman. I would describe myself as transmasculine nonbinary --- I feel an immense sense of freedom when I lean way more into the masculine side of things; when I first got my hair cut short, it was such a spectacular relief.

However, recently I've started questioning again, and constantly drilling myself on what I want to do in the future. For the most part, I'm reasonably okay with my body as it is now --- my chest is very small and not really noticeable thank goodness, and apparently I'm naturally androgynous and a lot of the time pass as a man. However, whenever I speak I feel like my voice gives me away, and makes me feel distanced from myself, like I'm spectating in my own life. Lately I've also been messing around with FaceApp and realised (despite the shame and embarrassment that has been so ingrained in me) that I would really like a beard. As it is, I naturally have the ability to grow a small bit of chin scruff (again, I've been trained to feel deeply ashamed of that) and I really like that. I seem to want to look very masculine but without being fully called a transgender man, for some reason --- and I'm afraid of that. 

I guess my question really is, where do I go from here? I've been toying in my head with the possibility of transitioning in the future, but I'm worried that transitioning would push me too far in the masculine direction. I'm also worried that it would remove any romantic prospects (my dad told me immediately upon coming out that no one would love me). I'm scared of being transgender because I know that I will probably have to deal with a ton of discrimination. But on the flip side, if I don't transition, I'm scared of my body becoming more feminine with age --- or missing the opportunity to be freely myself. Maybe testosterone and/or surgery, as terrifying as it could be to take that leap (I've never had surgery in my life), could make me feel happier. Life is short, and all; I don't want to get older and regret not doing something sooner. I would certainly like to broaden out my shoulders, deepen my voice a bit, and maybe get that bit of a beard.

I don't have any trans friends, so I'm unsure of who to talk to about how I feel. It's hard not to feel a dreadful sense of imposter syndrome whenever I realise that I am actually part of the LGBT community. I'm scared too, of all that I could have to deal with if I'm more open. Right now, I'm toeing the line where I'm pretty androgynous but can still safely pretend to be cisgender if I don't feel safe --- I'm only out to my immediate family, a handful of friends and a therapist who I don't get to see often. If I was able to try testosterone out, that social safety stealth blanket might be taken away. Would it be worth it?

652,2018-12-28 19:13:04,aada34,4,1,"I've come out to my coworkers, my partner, and some of my close friends. I have not come out to my parents, my brother, or my SIL. My parents are fairly supportive, though I don't think they know much about trans &amp; non-binary identities. My brother might be more challenging, and I'm really unsure about my SIL. I'm planning on sending them all roughly the same letter. Here it is: 

Dear (Family),

I want to share some news with you, and I‚Äôve been thinking for a while about the best way to tell you, so I‚Äôve written this letter. I‚Äôm non-binary. You probably don‚Äôt know what that means, so I‚Äôll explain. Non-binary describes people that do not fit neatly into the gender binary of man or woman. I am not a woman, I am non-binary. The reason I‚Äôm sharing this with you is because up until now, it has felt like something I need to hide. But I am not ashamed of who I am, and I want to be open with you. I‚Äôm sure that you have a lot of questions running through your head, so I‚Äôll try to answer some of them.

Non-binary falls under the transgender umbrella, as transgender describes people who do not identify as the gender they were assigned at birth. Gender identity is separate from biological sex, and many trans people will go through a social transition and/or a medical transition. I‚Äôm not planning on going through hormone replacement therapy or surgery, as I‚Äôm hopeful that exercise and clothing will be enough to address my discomfort with certain aspects of my body. However, I am going through a social transition, which means I am telling others about my gender identity and I am telling others how I want to be addressed. I am not comfortable with she/her pronouns or being called a woman/lady/girl. When someone uses these to describe me, it feels like they‚Äôre talking about someone else. I ask that you use they/them pronouns for me. For example, ‚Äú(Name) left their mail here. I‚Äôll send them a text so they can pick it up‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave you seen (Name)?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes, they‚Äôre in the kitchen peeling potatoes,‚Äù. This is really important to me. The most common objection that people have about they/them pronouns is that it refers to a group of people, not one person. But the singular they has been in use for many years to describe someone of unknown gender. For example, ‚Äúsomeone left their keys here,‚Äù or ‚Äúthey hung up without saying anything‚Äù. 

I‚Äôve come out at work, and asked everyone to use they/them pronouns for me. People have been accepting, and they‚Äôre doing well for the most part. But to help you understand why this is important for me, I‚Äôll explain how it feels when someone doesn‚Äôt use the right pronouns. Last week, a few people came to tour the shelter. My boss introduced me to our visitors and used she/her pronouns. I immediately felt my anxiety rise, my heart was pounding, and I felt awful - like who I am is shameful or inconvenient. It affected me for the rest of the day, and I lost sleep because I was trying to think of how to address it with her. When someone uses she/her to refer to me, it doesn‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs similar to when someone uses the wrong pronouns for you, it‚Äôs glaringly obvious and maybe a little uncomfortable. But when someone gets them right, it feels amazing. Recently, I overheard a co-worker‚Äôs phone conversation where he used they/them when speaking about me and I couldn‚Äôt stop grinning. I felt so happy and light for the rest of the day. In addition to they/them pronouns, I would like you to use gender-neutral terms like child or our youngest instead of daughter and sibling instead of sister. I expect an adjustment period but I would really appreciate your effort. These changes go a long way toward making me feel seen, accepted, and comfortable in my body and surroundings. 

This discovery and this process has been difficult for me. It‚Äôs tough to come to the realization that something‚Äôs not right and the only way you can move through life is by making yourself vulnerable and telling other people. Jason has been really supportive, and he has helped me more than he‚Äôll ever know. I‚Äôve also been seeing a therapist for a while to process these feelings. Even though it hasn‚Äôt been easy, it feels great to be true to myself and honor myself by being honest with others. But this is all still very fresh for me, and I‚Äôm feeling pretty raw so there may be some questions I‚Äôm not able to answer. I‚Äôve linked some resources at the bottom, and I would really like you to read through them before we talk. Please reach out to me when you feel ready. 
 
Love always,

670,2018-12-29 07:23:18,aaj766,18,1,"Tl;dr: I want to hear other's experiences of their nonbinary identities and why it is important for them to identify as nonbinary.

I grew up in the midwest, in a fairly purple area, but not very progressive. I've lived in a very liberal part of Washington state for the past 4 years and have gotten really used to that environment. I really came to understand my identity in that sort of progressive environment that welcomed nontraditional identities. Being home for the holidays has been a slightly painful reminder that not everywhere is so welcoming to people like me.

I had a long talk with someone very close to me who doesn't really understand nonbinary or trans identities. Basically his position is that humans are extremely varied, but he sees nonbinary identities as variations on the two binary sexes, and I don't think he understands the trans experience at all. E.g. as a masc/andro presenting afab person, I am just a particular variation on being a woman. He thinks trans and nonbinary experiences are valid, but doesn't really get why there ""needs to be all these different labels"". I don't think he really agrees with there being a difference between sex and gender. When I told him that sex is biology, but gender is about how we relate to ourselves and our society, his response was something along the lines of ""well who comes up with these definitions?"".

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, hello friends, I've been trying to write this post for like an hour because I can't find the right way to phrase this so we're just gonna go and see what happens.

I spend a lot of my time validating my identity because  I'm an agender, afab person who is comfortable in (and actually like) my afab body; I don't want surgery, I don't want hormones. The only things I'd change about my body is my junk &amp; my voice: I'd love some bottom-growth &amp; a lower/huskier voice. However, I don't want everything else that typically comes with those changes; to my knowledge there's no effective way to achieve bottom growth without hormones, and hormones come with other things like facial hair, male pattern baldness, bone growth, etc.

Overall I'm comfortable being in both masc &amp; femme clothes/appearances (either way I get read as 'she' so whatever, ugh) but I always feel like a """"""better"""""" agender person when I dress masc, than when I dress femme. *WHY?* It doesn't even make sense--being agender is literally *not having* a gender! It's the community that makes me feel like that though. Whenever I tell someone that I'm agender, there always seems to be this assumption that I'm going to get top surgery, or that--IDK, just lots of subtle things that make me feel like I'm less valid for not wanting to modify my body.

One of my partners is in a similar boat (though they like to dress primarily butch/masc), mostly being fine with their body but wanting to change little things that either require many more changes elsewhere, or that are actually impossible, so what do you do when that happens? You just learn to be comfortable with--or god forbid actually like--your body. It takes a lot of work though, especially in a society/community that still seems to prefer/privilege masc-aligned  appearances. 

&amp;#x200B;

***SO!*** I would love to have a conversation about why (in my experience) so many/most gq afab people gravitate toward a trans-masc presentation--or like, specifically, I guess about the 'androgynous ideal' that is basically just soft/effeminate masculinity.

Hi so as of this month I am just starting to identify as nonbinary and get more comfortable after questioning my gender identity especially these past six months and off and on over the past many years!

 I work as a private companion to a woman in her 90s who lives in a care facility and I'm regularly communicating with the other elderly residents and staff. I identified mostly as a butch lesbian up until now and had some issues with some residents talking about me behind my back and asking a lot questions as older people do. I've been called he, she, and it in a single conversation and have laughed at lots of jokes about myself. All the facility staff knew I was a girl and most of the residents knew I was too but they just thought I was really weird cause I looked like a 12 year old boy. Every time I told someone my name there was a lot of explaining to do....

 Fast forward to this week and my client has just moved to a new facility and I am super trans. I am experimenting with a new name while still using my nickname i've had since birth and was considering using it at work because I would be in a new place but I ended up not doing that because all of the other companions of my client are still working with her and they use my old name and i'm not ready to tackle this with all of them yet. 

With the staff at this new place I've been introducing myself and they automatically use she/her bc my name is feminine but with the residents I introduce myself and they usually mishear it/correct it to a masculine name and use he/him. Today I kept getting asked if I was a boy or girl by lots of them and I kept avoiding the question and let them assume that I was a young boy. I decided to introduce myself to a big group with the nickname I'm trying out because they already were assuming I was a boy and didn't want to complicate things. One of the younger facility staff who I had just introduced myself to (with my original nickname) heard what was going and came up and said ""Hey just so I don't get confused what are your pronouns?"" and I said that I use they/them and I felt really cool that someone asked me that outside an LGBT space. 

But yeah I ended up forcing myself to pass as a dude for 8 hours today and I thought it was fine because ""at least it's not a girl!"" but now I am realizing how emotionally exhausted I am after letting myself get misgendered multiple ways and making myself do that all day and i'm like ???? I don't really know what I want to do about this?? I don't know if I could come out as nonbinary at work because these are 70-100 year olds I am dealing with here and I don't even know where I would begin? I'm not even sure I would have the confidence and emotional energy to come out to the staff here and my coworkers because I know almost all of them would not know what nonbinary is and might even reject it&gt;&gt;??? (i'm not out to my family yet too) Is it even worth it to try?

Anyways I guess I am just looking for support here and thoughts on this whole situation? If I were to come out do is there any advice on doing this with very old people? I feel kind of overwhelmed thinking about this because I've kind of tangled myself up with two different names and three sets of pronouns these past few days.

hopefully this make sense!!

I really flip fop on my desire for top surgery. (I also flip flop on whether I'm a trans guy or AFAB nonbinary, but that's I'm sure partially due to obsessive tendencies I've got going on.) Lots of times I'm like ""omg I don't NEED these and they don't LOOK GOOD, they should just go now"" and other times I'll think ""meh. they're fine. why fix something that isn't broken."" (they're proportional to my body, as in I've stopped wearing bras and it doesn't hinder my daily activities, although we'll see how it goes in the summer when I gotta move from 100% hoodies 100% of the time to t-shirts forever). 

I used to love my breasts, and now i'm really ambiviliant about them. I completely understand that top surgery is a permanant choice and costs a lot of money and time and is not a decision to be taken lightly, but sometimes I'm really like ""meh"" about either option. And during the times I do want top surgery, I feel almost like ""if I don't want it all day every day then do I really want it at all? am I allowed to want it rn if I don't crave it two weeks from now?""

--------

I could never cry past the age of 8 or so. Even when I had those terrible mood swings in middle school from hormones and bad meds. 

Instead I would fall into an emotional process that took almost an entire day to complete, and often exhausted my entire family. It would start hours of seething irritation, and a feeling of confidence and power that slowly grew as I became less and less attached to reality. Then sudden, violent rage. My mom has told me that she was legitimately scared of me sometimes. Scared of _me_, the shy, quiet boy who stayed in and read and stayed calm when others got angry and never got into a fight at school in his life.

As the testosterone high dropped off, the rage would disappear, leaving behind exhaustion and a terrible aching pit. I felt spent. I could barely stand, barely speak, but the tears _just wouldn't come_. Then finally, blissful, awful emptiness, disattachment, mild concern, casualness and agreeability, my brain ten feet above my head. 

I never want to be like that again. But I am so, so afraid of dropping the shell, of losing the security that the rage and dissasociation gave, of falling into horrible vulnerability.

I need to let go but I. 

Just.

Can't.

I hate how difficult I've made it for me to feel my own emotions, but I'm terrified of breaking my internal view of myself as somebody cool and stern.

6,2018-12-01 14:39:22,a23i6r,23,1,"ok, please bare with me, my typing may go a bit wild because my thoughts are running wild, but here we go:  


I am a 14 year old male, and recently i am starting to think i am trans. I've always been a bit feminine (like i was always extremely sensitive and in-touch with my feelings, or i used to hide and play dress up games or romance games on my phone). But 8 days ago i was at family wedding and saw one of my female cousins (who everyone is saying i look like a male version of if that means anything?) wearing this dress and i thought to myself ""damn, that is nice, i wish i wore something like that"". But then i had to catch myself like ""wait, what? I'm a boy, i don't wear dresses?!' But the thought kept nagging at me all night, and i really liked it.  


So we get home, and i immediately hop on my laptop, pull up discord, and spam my 2 transgender friends (they're both ftm. We'll call them Friend and D. Also Friend is pan and D is ace if that also means anything?) I don't give anything away, but i ask them some questions, and the questions are basically all somewhere along the lines of ""do you do boy stuff a lot, and didn't realise it was boy stuff, like u just thought u were weird"" and then hit them with the big ""before you knew u were trans, did u ever see a boy wearing specific clothing and been like ""jesus i would love to wear that"" and then be like ""wait wot, hol up"". Both of them gave a big fat YES to every questions, so i hit them with the ""I think i might be trans""  


So they've been guiding me a lot recently, explaining how the whole thing works (psychologist, surgery, etc) and have been really good at answering my questions and just helping me understand wtf is going on. Anyways, i have a friend (we'll call him N). N is a 27 year old gaming streamer who lives on the other side of the globe, but i was his first follower that wasn't an irl friend, his first mod that wasn't an irl friend, i do the graphic design side of his stream, and i set up his discord. He sees me as a little brother, and we have a great connection, so since i don't have to see him face to face on a daily basis, N seemed like the perfect person to talk to about this. So i questioned him, and he gave me 2 very good pieces of advice. 1. You are 14, everyone else you know is most likely asking themselves the exact same questions (Am i a boy? A girl? Do i like boys? Girls? Both? Neither? Does this make me weird? Do they know what i'm thinking?), so don't do anything rash, make sure you are sure, and 2. A good way for you to find out would be to go shopping with a girl and just have a browse, try it.  


So i don't have a gf, or any girls that i hang out with outside of school really, so that would be difficult, but i thought ""Hey, i could use the online shops"". So i decided to just pull up 2 shopping websites. Rebel (sports), and Target (Department). Just jackets/jumpers, tops, and bottoms from these to shops made up 33 screenshots (and no screenshots of the same style of clothing e.g. hoodies, jeans, leggings etc). Basically, i love it.   


Every day has been coming with new realisations of stuff i've been doing that i just thought was either normal or me being weird. Things such as fantasising about being female in many scenarios, or using 2 towels, or hugging everyone, tying up my hair, and many more little things that i can't think of at the moment, that can easily be dismissed as not important, but when piling up, and combined with everything else, they don't seem so easy to dismiss.  


And that brings us to me making this post. So here is where we stand:  


**REASONS TO BELIEVE I AM TRANS:**

\- The vast majority of my fantasies are about or involve me being female  
\- I am constantly sneaking looks at women wearing makeup and envying it  
\- I love the female clothing selection so much more than the men's section  
\- I do a lot of minor feminine things by instinct, not by instillment such as many of my masculine actions  
\- I feel like i would be a lot more comfortable being female than male  
\- If i could choose to just magically wake up one day and be female, I would  


**REASONS TO BELIEVE I AM NOT TRANS:**  
\- I am much more comfortable talking to and being friends with boys than girls  
\- If i look in the mirror and see myself, i do not feel like a girl trapped in a boy's body, nor do i hate my appearance. I   
  would just be much more comfortable in a girl's body  
\- I act like a male (rough and sporty, swearing a lot, gaming, i love stereotypical male activities)  


I think that sums it up more or less. I've probably missed a few details here and there, but this should be good enough to go by. Thank you for bearing with me, i love you all.

I have just started transition officially (ftm) currently waiting for homonotherapy in february, But for now I was prescribed ""Depo-Provera"" which is apparently used to stop that time of the month. My question here is this;

(multiple after all)

I have been getting a little bit confused over the medication, I do know that it is a birth control (Never felt that dysphoric thinking about a word) And that it is not supposed to make you gain weight where you wouldnt usually want to as ftm (chest particulary) So i have been doing some research and can weirdly see that this medication is apparently used for people transitioning from mtf..??

-Hey- good- how are you? 
-Doing alright, just getting ready for finals week, and thinking about what to do during the break before we leave for the cruise. I really want to reconnect with some people that I went to school with, especially the ones in the LGBTQ community, but I don‚Äôt know how.
-Just reach out! Say hi. Invite them to coffee or something 
Keep it simple :)
-I also just wanted to thank you and [other sister] for reminding me that I don‚Äôt have to be exactly what other people want me to be, and that I shouldn‚Äôt make decisions based on what I think will gain other people‚Äôs approval. I was able to tell Dad that I wanted to do the normal BS program in pharmacy and take things slower rather than doing the BS/MS program, and I don‚Äôt think I could have done that without your help. I‚Äôm also learning how to assert myself in other ways, such as how I dress/look, which I know seems minor but even cutting my hair really short in high school and again very recently was something I had to sort of fight with mom about. Even now, I had to be quite firm in telling her I didn‚Äôt want to wear a dress on the formal night for the cruise. But for once I‚Äôm starting to feel more comfortable in my own skin, and I‚Äôm really thankful that you and [other sister] have been there to help me. I love you guys.
-Good for you. We love you too. Anyone who really loves you should not have any contingencies and mom should have 0 say in what the heck you want to do with your hair or wear to formal night (or any time). Being [mom‚Äôs name] is already taken, so be [my name]. It sounds WAY better that way 
And also good for you on school. Pursue something that pays the bills but also interests you. Don‚Äôt let a fear of disappointing others stop you. Like [other sister] said, they spent a lot for her to be a teacher. They‚Äôll get over it. Dad wasn‚Äôt happy about me being a food scientist either, but hey, it‚Äôs ok and I make a good living doing it. They‚Äôll move on, and again, they‚Äôre already taken so be [my name]. 
Also, [other sister] and I love getting to know [my name]. The [my name] with likes and interests and things that make her unique. Not the mold that mom and dad try to create. The things that make you you are special. Don‚Äôt let anybody take that away. 
-Yeah, my resolution for this coming year is to become a more authentic version of myself. I want to try exploring some new hobbies, and hopefully working to get over some of my insecurities. I really want to thank you for introducing me to fitness when I was younger. I really enjoyed going to the gym with you, but I just felt really insecure being surrounded by all these really strong and muscular people and feeling kind of bad about my own body and how comparatively small I was, which was entirely my problem and had nothing to do with you or anyone else at the gym. 
-Yeah, the gym can be a good place but also a tough one. Everybody is built differently and has different natural strengths and weaknesses. We are both on the small side, and sometimes it can be hard even for me to watch how easily some people put on muscle. I think what has helped me a lot is to be process oriented and also to find a hobby that brings me a lot of joy (triathlon), because I enjoy what I‚Äôm doing while staying healthy, but don‚Äôt worry about what everyone else is doing since it‚Äôs for me. Also, remember that that girl with the bigger muscles might be looking at you wishing she was smaller. Everyone feels that way sometimes, but the key is to find joy in the way you are and to take care of the body you‚Äôve been given the best that you can 
-Yeah, I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôve gained enough weight to find clothes that fit my body right. But it‚Äôs weird that most of the girls I grew up around wanted to be skinny whereas I wanted to be tall and muscular. I felt really weird about it, and I still do. 
-I know it can sometimes feel weird to want something that isn‚Äôt pushed by society, but again, these things make you you. Do your thing! Can‚Äôt get much taller unfortunately, but you can find ways to express yourself 
-That‚Äôs true. 
Thankfully there are other people I know who are also finding new ways to be themselves which I find really encouraging. Not that I need to go along with what everyone else is doing, but it helps to feel less alone.

The problem is I didn‚Äôt realize what my ‚Äòissue‚Äô was, then; and further that getting jacked (slight overstatement) wasn‚Äôt actually any help... it just made things 10x worse.

Based on my knowledge of myself and dieting, I COULD get away with eating 750-1,250 calories daily, if I stick with a low-fat high-protein (120+ grams) low carb (&lt;20 grams) diet, and could end up losing the amount of mass I would like by sometime early next year.

I‚Äôve only ever cut by 500-600 calories daily... is this a bad idea, even if I make sure I get the micros/macros I need AND continue staying active?

I want do justice to the experiences and issues within the trans community, not only during the 60s/70s but also just in general!  \nIf anyone out there has any information, stories, experiences that you think could in any way help me write my story, whether you have transitioned or was around in the 60s/70s, or both/neither... please just share what you have to say!  Even better, if you think you would be comfortable having me ask a few questions please pm me!  Thank you in advance!!! \n(if I said anything inaccurate or offensive please forgive me I am not (yet)  fully familiar with all of the terms)  much love :)"", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'please share experiences!!!', 'created': 1543927083.0}"

I'm transitioning for 1 year now. Obviously there haven't been any issues coming up with my transition on work. No one said something negative, no one laughed or such things.

But under the hood, there have been enormous changes in how I've been seen.

I am working as a software engineer. And coworkers didn't help me, when I said I need help. Coworkers said things like ""I doesn't want her to work on this topic."". Or when I recognized an error in the software, which was currently written by an coworker, it took me a hard fight of 4 weeks to get heard, and we could talk about that error. 4 weeks ! - the result was, it was an error, and he fixed it easily.

I never had such issues before my transition.

And my supervisor did nothing. He simply did nothing. So the last chance was, to escalate this to HR. So HR spoke to the other coworkers, and they are very, very angry about me. 2 of them wanted to consult a lawyer, cause I insinuate transphobia. I never said this, but I said, that this started the last year, in my opinion.

So today there was an consultation with the supervisor of my supervisor, our head of HR and me. To take a long story short: They want to fire me.

Luckily I live and work in Germany, and they cannot fire me as easy as you can in the US, but they can make my life a hell. And in the end they can fire me, it only takes a little more time.

I'm so sad.

Tuning out of starlight
The innocent lifetime flickers and flashes
Onto a canvas
No, nobody seems worth it
And while the feeling's sophisticated
The view is so restrained
The past is nearing closer and closer I fear

So let's just cut the bullshit
And tell me who's independent
Thumbs twiddling and your life's escaping your mind
Keep in mind
Well the air ain't free as it used to be
But that's quite alright when you're still eighteen
It seems to be
And I'll tell you who's overrated
What's a beautiful person with some hideous dreams?
And while the lining isn't silver
We're verging on the side of the road that'll take us home

The edge of us is getting weighed
Read about your life in your local papers
Realize the end of us is getting near
You're just a droplet of paint trickled off your canvas

Delirious illusions flowing backwards through the river of color
While we analyze it to try see it clearer
Secretly appealing to a lonely prisoner
Now what's your vision?

Initiate your shading, blend the universe together in time
It only gets a little easier
Suddenly piece yourself back together now
What's your vision?

And I don't wanna have to give a damn about you
Or your inhibitions
After all, you're the one who taught me love
Was not for everybody
However, I'm starting to see this world in the right light
Yet it still gets darker
You see, it's just a simple symphony
Or a painting
Whatever

This unnatural path
It spans infinitely
But my world is crumbling
Let it collapse into the abyss
In the midst of summer it won't exist
This emptiness
It's just a blank slate
Waiting for a painter to interfere
It's quite complex
But what do I know?.",trans,"This song is so fitting, I think I relate almost too well, I felt it needed to be shared",1543973090.0,"{'created_utc': 1543947890, 'id': 'a33b33', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""Canvas by Rezonate\n\nTuning out of starlight\nThe innocent lifetime flickers and flashes\nOnto a canvas\nNo, nobody seems worth it\nAnd while the feeling's sophisticated\nThe view is so restrained\nThe past is nearing closer and closer I fear\n\nSo let's just cut the bullshit\nAnd tell me who's independent\nThumbs twiddling and your life's escaping your mind\nKeep in mind\nWell the air ain't free as it used to be\nBut that's quite alright when you're still eighteen\nIt seems to be\nAnd I'll tell you who's overrated\nWhat's a beautiful person with some hideous dreams?\nAnd while the lining isn't silver\nWe're verging on the side of the road that'll take us home\n\nThe edge of us is getting weighed\nRead about your life in your local papers\nRealize the end of us is getting near\nYou're just a droplet of paint trickled off your canvas\n\nDelirious illusions flowing backwards through the river of color\nWhile we analyze it to try see it clearer\nSecretly appealing to a lonely prisoner\nNow what's your vision?\n\nInitiate your shading, blend the universe together in time\nIt only gets a little easier\nSuddenly piece yourself back together now\nWhat's your vision?\n\nAnd I don't wanna have to give a damn about you\nOr your inhibitions\nAfter all, you're the one who taught me love\nWas not for everybody\nHowever, I'm starting to see this world in the right light\nYet it still gets darker\nYou see, it's just a simple symphony\nOr a painting\nWhatever\n\nThis unnatural path\nIt spans infinitely\nBut my world is crumbling\nLet it collapse into the abyss\nIn the midst of summer it won't exist\nThis emptiness\nIt's just a blank slate\nWaiting for a painter to interfere\nIt's quite complex\nBut what do I know?."", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'This song is so fitting, I think I relate almost too well, I felt it needed to be shared', 'created': 1543973090.0}"

66,2018-12-04 23:30:20,a369j7,4,1,"There is an actual question in this, but I'm going to vent about my childhood a bit first.

So, I'm basically a textbook case of gender dysphoria. Knew from as young as three, had the ""boy stuck in a girl's body"" mentality, strong opposition to traditionally feminine stuff and strong preference for traditionally masculine stuff, etc.. But my question is in regards to the sense of self and personality.

I realized from as young as three that my idea of who I was conflicted with the way others saw me, not just as far as gender, but also personality. I didn't pay it much attention because, well, I was three. I only started to really think about it once I was around nine or ten. It felt like I couldn't be myself around my family the way I could at school around my friends. My family didn't like it when I was a rambunctious, happy, fun-loving little boy. I felt like I had to be completely silent and emotionless around them to live up to their pre-created ideal of me as their ""shy, quiet little girl."" And even if I was myself around them, it didn't feel right to know that they were still seeing me as that girl. Plus, my mom made it very clear to me that she would only love me if I was a girl. The only affection she showed me was super gendered, and although she didn't refuse to buy me boy clothes, she made sure to make me feel guilty about it the whole time.

I was excited for middle school because I was convinced that I would go through male puberty due to having a male brain. I thought that my body would finally catch up with my brain and everything would fall into place; my family would finally learn that I was a boy, I could go to middle school as a boy, I could finally express myself and my personality without hesitation or fear. But of course that didn't happen. Once I learned that it wasn't going to happen and I'd have to go to middle school as a girl, I sort of fell into a depression. I figured, ""I have to grow up and be a girl now,"" but all I knew about being a girl was being silent, not saying anything, not forming opinions or having beliefs. Basically just existing as little as possible. I assumed that that was who I was, because that made the adults happy, and obviously they knew more about everything than I did because they were adults and I was just a kid.

I stayed like that for the rest of middle school and through all of high school as well, though I think I did get a few more aspects of my old personality back once I started living as a guy junior year. But I still feel like I'm not allowed to have a personality or beliefs or anything. I'm trying to go back to being the outgoing, fun-loving little dude I was in fifth grade because that really felt like it was me. But it's really hard. I'm so used to being this emotionless, voiceless person that everyone wanted me to be that it's hard to shake that off of me.

So my question is, does anybody else feel this way? Like they had to abandon their real personality at a certain age just to please the role their family forced them into because of their birth sex? If so, how did you go about finding yourself afterwards? I'm not just talking about gender identity here, as we've obviously all had to hide that before. I mean personality. I figure gender identity and personality are linked, and it seems like so many trans people are totally able to embrace their personalities just after coming out and starting transition.

I thought that my body would finally catch up with my brain and everything would fall into place; my family would finally learn that I was a boy, I could go to middle school as a boy, I could finally express myself and my personality without hesitation or fear. But of course that didn\'t happen. Once I learned that it wasn\'t going to happen and I\'d have to go to middle school as a girl, I sort of fell into a depression. I figured, ""I have to grow up and be a girl now,"" but all I knew about being a girl was being silent, not saying anything, not forming opinions or having beliefs. Basically just existing as little as possible. I assumed that that was who I was, because that made the adults happy, and obviously they knew more about everything than I did because they were adults and I was just a kid.\n\nI stayed like that for the rest of middle school and through all of high school as well, though I think I did get a few more aspects of my old personality back once I started living as a guy junior year. But I still feel like I\'m not allowed to have a personality or beliefs or anything. I\'m trying to go back to being the outgoing, fun-loving little dude I was in fifth grade because that really felt like it was me. But it\'s really hard. I\'m so used to being this emotionless, voiceless person that everyone wanted me to be that it\'s hard to shake that off of me.\n\nSo my question is, does anybody else feel this way? Like they had to abandon their real personality at a certain age just to please the role their family forced them into because of their birth sex? If so, how did you go about finding yourself afterwards? I\'m not just talking about gender identity here, as we\'ve obviously all had to hide that before. I mean personality. I figure gender identity and personality are linked, and it seems like so many trans people are totally able to embrace their personalities just after coming out and starting transition. I\'ve been living as a guy for two years now, but I still feel stuck in this regard and am looking to change. Any help or advice would be thoroughly appreciated.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Anyone else feel like this?', 'created': 1543991420.0}"

So, I am not on hormones yet, but I am partly asian and therefore, I don't really look that masculine. Luckily, this lets me pass (with some help from my dear friend makeup :&gt;)
I am 22 and share a flat with a girl (25) and a dude (25ish). The girl is the only person who knows about me being trans. So, when the dudes not in the city (which happens quite frequently), I am able to dress up and roam around the city. So far so good.. however, as I was getting ready, the girl told me that a friend of hers would come over and she'd be very accepting. 2 minutes later the door bell rang and we greeted each other. She was indeed very lovely! They even lent me a scarf! They also complimented me which boosted my confidence. As I went out, I even bought some groceries and makeup (although the store had some self scanning checkout, so I was able to avoid any contact). After that I went for a short walk and didn't get any weird looks (going out when it's dark definitely helps!). 

After getting home I went back into my room. As I went for a smoke, the other two girls were on the balcony as well, so we talked a bit (haven't mastered my voice which makes me rather anxious when talking in my 'girl voice'). They saw a friend on the streets and invited her. So, there was a new person to meet while being all dressed up. Both times I was very nervous but in hindsight, I am very happy that I got to meet them. It really helped my confidence that there are suuuper supportive people out there. Also the fact that I (unintentionally) pushed my boundaries made me happy (some sort of adrenaline kick haha).

Yep, that was the story. Nothing special but IMO it's the little things and successes that count! :)

TL;DR: Unintentionally met new people while being dressed up made me happy as they were really supportive!

As I went out, I even bought some groceries and makeup (although the store had some self scanning checkout, so I was able to avoid any contact). After that I went for a short walk and didn't get any weird looks (going out when it's dark definitely helps!). \n\nAfter getting home I went back into my room. As I went for a smoke, the other two girls were on the balcony as well, so we talked a bit (haven't mastered my voice which makes me rather anxious when talking in my 'girl voice'). They saw a friend on the streets and invited her. So, there was a new person to meet while being all dressed up. Both times I was very nervous but in hindsight, I am very happy that I got to meet them. It really helped my confidence that there are suuuper supportive people out there. Also the fact that I (unintentionally) pushed my boundaries made me happy (some sort of adrenaline kick haha).\n\nYep, that was the story. Nothing special but IMO it's the little things and successes that count! :)\n\nTL;DR: Unintentionally met new people while being dressed up made me happy as they were really supportive! \n\nPS: Sorry for any incorrect use of the english language, it's not my first language :-o\n\nPPS: I am really sorry if this is the wrong sub :^("", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Pushing Boundaries made me happy!', 'created': 1544073316.0}"

i keep seeing posts/news articles about the high attempted suicide rate of trans people, and it just makes me scared and so, so sad, and makes the hurt worse. and there was a post recently on /r/MtF about the things trans women have to deal with on a day-to-day basis and that makes me so scared as well.

\- How old do you have to be for certain surgeries?  
\- Do you get period, can you become pregnant, etc after getting a vagina  
\- What do they do about, intercourse? like, will you feel anything, can you, umm, y'know... orgasm?  
\- Is it normal to be chill with pronouns before transitioning (before i transition i am cool with people still calling me a boy? does this make me not trans?)

I‚Äôve been learning to feel comfortable swaying my hips, and standing contrapposto, with my hips slanted one side above the other supporting my weight on one leg.

I‚Äôve started crossing my legs with one knee over the other, and starting to feel embarrassed about unconsciously man spreading my legs.

I‚Äôve started flipping my wrist, touching my hair and my lips when I‚Äôm feeling flirtatious and aroused.

When I juggle my soccer ball I feel more comfortable exploring the relationship I have with my ball as I chase it and keep it from the ground. I‚Äôm light on my feet and almost dancing, deciding in each split second how slowly or quickly I should attack the ball in a way I can not even predict. If I drop my ball I can freely express my emotions of joy and frustration by spinning or bounding with my body.

My lover even picked me up yesterday, and I held on to her by wrapping my legs around her waist as she spun me around. Right then I was overwhelmed with gender euphoria, and felt so authentic and feminine.

There is even an aspect to masculinity that many men feel uncomfortable being touched, physically comforted and nurtured, but they are comfortable being the ones touching their partners. Imagine a loved one just holding you while stroking your hair or cheek.

I feel a lot more confident speaking up about my feelings, and I don‚Äôt care about appearing strong and stoic anymore, I can be silly and that has changed the basic relationship I have when I inhabit my body. 

I have a much larger emotional range I am comfortable feeling inside myself and expressing. Sometimes it feels good to feel weak and helpless till tears start running down my cheeks.

I think most men are afraid of inhabiting their bodies in that way because they are afraid of being seen as gay. It takes a lot of work to actively overcome that fear, and I doubt many men would do that unless they felt they had to, because it is very scaring knowing people see you as something different.

If you want to see how scared you are try painting your fingernails and then go to the supermarket.

His reasoning is that he finds it disgusting and just doesn't want to be aware that he bleeds. And i get that, even if i personally do not get dysphoric over my period. But i find not showering for a week to be just as disgusting.

Any ideas and/or tips what I could do to maintain basic bodily hygiene during that time of the month?

So, hi, I'm Lilly! Mtf, obviously.

I just wanted to put my thoughts somewhere to maybe get a few in return. Here we go.

If you ask me, I'm not trans. I'm a woman. That's just it. Although there's that nagging voice in my head trying to question my validity, I have had conversations with girls about ""typical girl things"" and they totally knew what I was talking about, to the point of even blushing when the topics got a bit, erm, _oolala_. I hold onto that, because it proves to me that I don't have to learn how to be a woman because I'm trans, I already am. The more comfortable/happy I feel, the more happens automatically, including movement (move dem hips), gestures, voice modulation and so on.
Being trans is just the term to unite all the different aspects of my position for people who aren't in my shoes, which are a lot of course. Not the shoes, the people I mean. I'm too broke to buy shoes yet.

And sure, I look in the mirror and some boyish lad stares back at me, but in the end that's hopefully temporary. I've got my first contact appointment in about a month. Let's hope I get my tiddyskittles quickly, because considering my body hair growth I'm either very slowly becoming a werewolf who doesn't care about moonphases or the last sorry bits of puberty are trying to finish the job, fss. 

Anyway, for that exact reason I want to go full time stealth except maybe for some close friends that I might make in my new home town. When I've got my hormones and wardrobe sorted out, I'm _done_. Just fucking _done_. Maybe I'm mistaken in saying this, but as soon as I start passing, it'll be irrelevant for people to know I'm trans. Not that it is now, but I can't help people making a doubletake when looking at me right now.

I hear a lot something along the lines of ""I can't do this now, I've got too much at stake in career and this and that"" Well, I haven't got a career and I desperately need to start getting a job so I can stay with my girlfriend and combat my depression, but I'd rather jump into the fire and flame on than sit everything out and keep decaying. Other problems be damned, I'm taking them on all at once!

I think I'm done here. Hope I didn't offend or destroy someone's morale with the last bit, but I had to put it out there somewhere just to have said it once.
So yea, if you're sure about who you are and you're hesitant to transition, then I'd say: Just do it. You deserve and owe it to yourself. I stalled an entire year and I fucking hate that I did; I could have had so much hormonal progress in that one year. Instead I tucked it away and dissociated until I nearly fell apart completely.
So yea do it, in a safe way, as best as you can.
Go gettit!

I was hoping that someone could point me in the right directions for different resources on the hormones in Hormone Therapy, and what kind of effects they'll have on my body. I'm supposed to hear about more info for my intake at my local LGBT center.   


I'm obviously aware of what Estrodial will do, and I'm also aware of finasteride and it's effects as I take it already for hair loss. I'm essentially trying to have all my information correct so that when my parents start trying to talk down to me about ""the dangers and permanency of HRT"" that I can assure them that I know what I'm doing and aware of what will happen/take place in my body, as well as mental state.   


I know that results may vary depending on person to person so I want to make sure that there is some kind of standard or base standard that I can use when trying to talk to them about this, so that I don't seem to them like a confused child.   


Effects that I'm hoping to look more into are:  


Slowing down baldness/thickening of hair  
Better fat distribution in hips and breast area   
Thinning and slowing down growth of body hair  
Facial fat changing/reshaping (however you refer to it as)  


Sorry if my question or request doesn't fit the rules of the subreddit, but I just want help in getting my point across, as well as find a way to do some research that I can take back to my mentor, who is helping me plan a way to get this across to my parents that this is what I want and need to be happy, and that this is most certainly not a phase of my existence.

My dad seems to be trying but also seems to still (after nearly nine years of living full time as male) be hoping its a phase.
With him, he brought a few ornaments from when I was a kid. I didn't say anything about it when he found one that was a picture of my older brother and I at like, 2 &amp;4 years old, because we lost all our photos of when I was a kid in a house fire and I knew how much it meant to my mom.

201,2018-12-11 16:49:53,a58ier,8,1,"Okay, so I‚Äôve been on hormones for about 4.5 months and I‚Äôve always had big feet to match my big size (6‚Äô3‚Äù, 303 lbs, and size 15 women‚Äôs shoes at the start of my transition). Well, I‚Äôve been busting my ass in the gym since August, dieted, and spent a week in the hospital with appendicitis and I‚Äôm now down to 271 pounds.

I was invited to a holiday party/potluck coming up in a couple weeks and I needed to get a new outfit. I‚Äôve been struggling finding a cute pair of flats online to wear, so I decided to go to Payless to see if somehow by the grace of God they had some larger sizes. Well, I immediately got discouraged when I saw they only went up to a 13. I don‚Äôt know what caused it, but I grabbed a shoe and slid it on my foot and HOLY SHIT it fit! It actually was a little big to be honest. So I decided to press my luck. I grabbed a 12 and slid it on. My foot fit inside although it was a little too tight to wear all night at a party. I found one of the old school metal foot sizer things and measured my foot. I have a ladies‚Äô size 12.5 foot!!!!!

I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been in my entire life and i love this man with my entire heart.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to him about wether he wants to transition or not because I‚Äôm afraid of saying the wrong thing. But I‚Äôve been recently tearing myself up over wether I would still be attracted to him physically if he begins to transition.

**TW: mild to a bit spicy transphobia** and me being a frustrated ball of anger. 

Like holy shit i told her yo im trans I'm still in closet pls don't tell anyone.

And then she calls me to talk ot through and she was like i always thought you were bisexual didn't know you were into men........

Then called me sis but then continued everything else with male pronouns (even worse my native language is super gendered)

Then i was like yo girl im into women and she was like but how can you be trans and into women.....

Asked me how long I've known and i was like a few years but denied it and she was like WOAH THAT WAS BEFORE TRANS PEOPLE WERE FASHIONABLE


And then even though i told her to keep a secret, a secret secret she decided to YELL AT A ROOM FULL OF PEOPLE THROUGH THE PHONE that her brother is now her sister.


And like at this point i got really really mad i mean mild transphobia is expected of uneducated peeps BUT in no fucking way does she have the authority to come out for me. And i told her that. That's overstepping my boundaries that's part of my personal space and has to do only with me, and i told her to keep a secret.

Anyway i told her she's acting like a piece of shit and i regret telling her im trans. I know, harsh, but i got really really mad at this

So, anyway, she called 10 mins latwr to apologise and i told her that I'm alright with the whole thing. I just wanna be respected, and the rest is basically up to her to get educated on what trans people are and so on.

I would love to hear a little about how your journey has been so far to get to here.

Me:

I'm a odd kind of guy that never really fit in to most norms.
About 10 years ago I found out that I did have a bi curious side to me that I needed to figure out. I had a few meetings with men over the years and it was a slow journey for me.
The last couple of years I have journeyed a bit further I to this whole thing. I am bisexual but to my great great surprise I am also quite fond of the feminine.
Basically I was called a gender when younger and never really understood it. Now I get it. I'm a man but I don't fit into the manly man mold in any way.
I wanted to try on a pair of thongs a few months ago. Oh boy. I shouldn't have. It was as if it talked to my soul in some way. As if something hidden or withheld all of a sudden emerged.

It just felt so comforting and satisfying. Not even in a sexual way. Something just clicked.

I am still only at a place where I only have a few pieces of underwear but every day I can't wait to wear it. I have a wife and 3 kids that I still live with for now (we are separated and waiting to move).

Yesterday I bought some everyday hipsters that's very comfortable and a bra. I figure those panties will start to be worn every day.

My wife or rather my gf (which we are now instead of man and wife) knows little about it. She knows I'm bi and am with men from time to time.
She also found me with laced panties one night (I let her find me really), and she found it prettttty odd. I'm sure she found my stash of nylons and panties. Not yet seen the bra üòÇ. 

For me I can't wait to proceed further into this whole crossdressing. I want to get my nails done, do more hair removal, buy clothes shoes, try makeup on. I want to see a full transformation of myself. 
I have a feeling when I move into my own flat I will have some fun!

348,2018-12-19 00:12:35,a7gyvt,9,1,"Hey all, 

I'm a girl in a girls body, growing up I was a massive tomboy etc. I remember when I was 12 being outside the girls changing rooms in line for p.e. with the boys while we waited for the girls to hurry up, and I turned round to my friends and said I think I'm a boy for being ready so quick haha, while having that first question to myself of ""am I actually a boy with girl parts"", this was a thought I had before I even know anything about transgender. I always picked boys to play in video games, in kiss chase I always wanted to be the kisser rather than the kissee because I thought it was too girly, I was always king because I don't like being called queen and I never wanted to be the mum when playing families.

Fast forward through high school I was still one of the lads, everyone assumed I had no boobs because I wore baggy clothes and just had no interest to show my body off, if anything I was embarrassed of it. I always put myself down because of it. I didn't really question myself in high school as I was comfortable with my friends, but ""girly"" things would make me freak out, I only ever went bra shopping once and it caused me to have a meltdown in the shop. I was 15üòÇ

Then college came, still happy being myself, college was chill and everyone was more open/accepting/not bothered about what anyone was. I met my now boyfriend and we've been together for almost 4 years. He has always told me how beautiful I am and how much he loves my body and I shouldn't be ashamed of it since day 1, he still does it and is always trying to help me see that I am. 

But the problem is, I don't feel it. Over the past year or so my gender has been popping up in my mind every now and then, especially as I start to think about myself getting older and what I kinda see for myself. For example I'm terrified of giving birth and I don't like the idea of being pregnant, it's too ""gross"" to me, so I always say I don't want kids, when in reality I do, I love kids, I just don't want one from being a girl nor does the idea of being called mum appealing to me. 
Anyway these past few weeks these feelings have been a lot more present in my head, I don't know if it's been influenced by People on YouTube, the media etc but they are there and some things they say I relate to. Admittedly there are very rare times I feel confident in my body, but even then I can't refer to my boobs as boobs, they are things. My down there is worse, I literally call it my down there. The thing that triggers me the most is bras, once I've got one I'm like going to wear that every day for fucking ages, until it rips and falls apart, I had never shopped for my own, my mum always dealt with it for me and handed me the plainest ones she found. What really got to me was that my bf brought me a bra, but it was the wrong size... So we went to exchange it and I ended up going in the measuring room, and my god I've never felt so uncomfortable in my life with myself. Honestly I was shaking, back to mirror constantly and to the lady measuring she was so helpful and sweet bless her but I probably came across like right weirdo! Once that whole ordeal was over I freaked out and it put me on edge, I had a proper breakdown once I was alone and I just cried confused at everything. 

I don't know. Just the idea of me maybe not being a girl is scary. I still can't stand being called a lady, or woman or mum (to my pet). I am really uncomfortable with my body about 96% of the time. I just try not to think about any of it and tell myself it's me being silly or I'm just having a blip with my head and stuff. The more I think about it the more it starts to make sense, but it might be cos I'm thinking about it so much that I'm tricking myself into thinking I'm a boy?! Or what if it's just I really have no body confidence?? It's such a big thing to think about and it scares the shit out of me, these thoughts could just be temporary but what if they're not? Like I'm scared of how I'd go about it, how it would effect my relationship and how my family would react (I know how they each would already though)

It's just a scary thing and sorry I think I needed to type and release this to someone. Thanks for reading, if you have any advice for my confused self then I'm all ears! 

Oh and just a note, I spoke to my bf about it after my major bra store freakout, he was really supportive and was absolutely devastatingly sorry over how I felt, he felt like it was his fault when it really wasn't.

357,2018-12-19 08:51:14,a7kplp,1,1,"Okay so I apologize if I offend anyone with anything I say because ill admit I don't know much about this sort of stuff. Also I'm not even sure this is the right sub for this so I also apologize if it's not.

A little bit of background, my baby brother is 17 and I am a 25 y/ o female. 

We have been playing lots of online video games together recently and have gotten much closer in the last few months. (We live across the country from each other.)

He's painfully shy around people he doesn't know well and he had terrible anxiety in school so he is now homeschooled. He doesn't open up to many people but he seems to be starting to open up to me. 

I love him no matter what, whether he wants to be my sister or brother, and I want him to know that but I also don't want to upset him if I'm completely off the mark.

My mom told me that a few months ago she went school shopping for him and came home with about 100 dollars worth of stuff (she doesn't have much money, so to them that is quite a bit) which was some things like jeans and t shirts and boxers. He wanted to take all of it back and find something else, which at the time hurt her feelings but he went with her to the store, which is actually a big feat for him because he rarely leaves the house and bought a coat out of the women's section. He LOVES that coat a lot, enough to where he was so proud of it he sent me a picture of himself wearing it which he never does. And it's a super cute coat too. 

He watches tons of anime and not long ago he started sending me pictures of girls that are called traps, which I didn't at the time know what they were so he explained them to me. I didn't know at the time what his fascination with them was and I don't still I guess, but he talks about weird stuff off and on so I didn't really question it that much. Basically he played a game where he sent me pictures of traps and wanted me to guess whether they were girl or guy. 

Most recently he ended up buying for himself a cosplay of a certain female anime character and he is super excited for it. And he just bought it for himself, no other rhyme or reason. He told me he'd send me a picture when he gets it, which he hasn't yet.

And maybe I'm just completely wrong here, or maybe he just has an interest in women's fashion, I truly don't know.

I guess what I'm asking here is, how do I approach the fact that I will love him no matter who or what he wants to be without possibly upsetting him or alienating him? I just want him to know he is accepted and loved. I know my mom feels the same way but also doesn't know how to approach him on the subject. Or should I just let him be and let him decide if he wants to talk to me about anything? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you

374,2018-12-20 05:26:05,a7uqtd,2,1,"So. I honestly don‚Äôt know what to call myself, since, well. Here it is. 

I‚Äôm a trans man (female to male) who is post-transition, but I dress like a girl half the time, because, well, all of my dysphoria was body related issues. (Voice and chest, mostly). 
I do not regret my transition at all. I just think girls fashion is cuter, and I feel good when I wear it.
I‚Äôve considered calling myself genderfluid, but most people I know think that‚Äôs bullshit, plus I feel like a man all the time, but I just consider myself a man who wears feminine things. 

Which would be fine, if they thought genderfluid was a valid option. Which they don‚Äôt.
I‚Äôm a senior in high school. High schoolers aren‚Äôt nice.

I have called myself a crossdresser, which also made people upset. Some people I know said ‚Äútrans men can‚Äôt be crossdressers, or else they‚Äôre just cis.‚Äù



I have recently discovered the term ‚Äútrap‚Äù as referring to men who wear feminine things and could also look feminine in general,

Preferred pronouns

I always wince when I hear people talking about preferred pronouns. I'm sure there are exceptions (e.g. ""I prefer zie, but I'm OK with they"" or something), but I'm confident most people don't have preferred pronouns, they just have pronouns, period. Why suggest to other people that it's OK to use anything other than your pronouns if you don't actually want to go by more than one (set)?

I identify as \[sex or gender\]

Cis people don't typically go around saying ""I identify as"" a man, a woman, male, or female. I think the whole ""I identify as"" just helps encourage people to believe that we're not really who we say and know ourselves to be.

I've always liked \[color\], played with \[toys\], and gone straight to the \[gender\] section in \[store\]

I especially see this in videos when people are asked how they knew they were trans. We know this is more about gender roles than gender identity and that it was mostly a clue to our gender identity, but this confuses cis people into thinking were just gender non-conforming and deluded unless we explicitly clarify that this stuff doesn't make us trans, it was just a tip-off that helped us (or those around us) recognize our identity.",trans,Ways I think we make our lives unnecessarily confusing and difficult,1545457993.0,"{'created_utc': 1545432793, 'id': 'a8fc4b', 'num_comments': 5, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'These have been percolating in my mind for a while, but especially after watching a bunch of trans-related videos recently, I thought I would bring these up for discussion.

My Answer- I believe the biggest issue that today's society faces is the misunderstanding of mental illnesses that cause people to damage their physical body. The problem with this issue is that it is socially acceptable, and if people stand against the current ideas of this issue you can be labelled, offensive and socially unaware. The issue I am referring to is the way humanity deals with people with problems identifying their gender and therefore damaging their physical persona. In present times the 'cure' to people that are diagnosed with gender dysphoria is surgery to change their genitalia and modify their hormones. These procedures are near irreversible and can be highly damaging and have great risk involved, and people can come out of this 'cure' feeling more dissatisfied about the body that they were before, and they would become mentally unstable and this could lead to even greater issues like suicide, or self-harm. My ideas toward this problem is that this health condition should be acknowledged as a mental illness, the reason I believe is if for example if you have a mental illness that makes you want to commit self-harm on yourself, professionals would send them to a psychologist, to protect yourself to damage to your own body. Now if we apply this to gender dysphoria, if you think you are a different gender and want to damage your body by giving yourself hormones and having dangerous surgery on your genitalia, surely the doctors would send you to a psychologist, this is like letting a person cut themselves because it's what they want. We are teaching people who believe they are transsexual that they have to change their body in order to feel right, however why don't we teach them that they have to change their brain in order to feel right in their body, sure this takes more time and requires the diagnosed to help themselves, but its reduces their physical risk. A statistic I found is the percentage of transsexuals that have reportedly attempted suicide, this is just under 50%, which absolutely horrific, even after the operation the statistic stays constant, so with psychotherapy we could aim to reduce this. My final point is that what if the patient turns out not to have gender dysphoria, only they are going through a temporary phase of gender confusion, and after a year, or shorter they decide they made a mistake and want to go back to being cisgendered. This would be very difficult to perform in a surgery and would put the patients in even more danger and risk, not to mention this would cost the NHS thousands per patient, which could be significantly lower than if these people undergo psychotherapy. I also just want to say I wrote this not to offend and discriminate against people dealing with this illness, only to present different ideas regarding this topic, they may be right or wrong it is only my personal opinion, and that is what the question asked me for.

so here goes a bunch of experiences i‚Äôve had that i need help deciphering. 

- when i was younger, a kid at my school came out as trans (ftm). i went out of my way to cover up his birthname on his locker with his name. i always really wanted to be friends with him even though he was a pretty shitty person. i talked about him way too much and got extremely upset the one time he was mad at me. 
- in middle school once i started dressing myself i mostly wore jeans/leggings graphic tees, never anything feminine
- i have one clear memory from 4th or 5th grade when i put my hair into a hat at a fair and wanted people to mistake me for a boy
- in 6th grade i asked a kid in my class to be an ‚Äúhonorary boy‚Äù 
- always cared about being accepted by boys i knew, even today 
- when i got my period, i was extremely upset and in denial instead of being excited to become a woman 
- in middle, i followed a bunch of trans guys on instagram and knew way too much about hormones and surgeries and binding, etc 
- in middle + early highschool, i wore the same sports bra every day
- when my mom tried to take me bra shopping a few months ago i refused to go into the store, freaked out (even though subconsciously i knew there was nothing to freak out about) and almost cried
- freshman + sophomore year especially i had horrible social anxiety and found myself going home early from school and isolating myself, and i always felt like everyone was staring and laughing at me
- i still can‚Äôt picture myself as an adult or even out of high school. i feel like i don‚Äôt have a future and i‚Äôm reading my life off a script 
- i was really jealous last month when my friend told me he was going on testosterone
- i hate being called girl or she especially in public by strangers. i feel disappointed they didn‚Äôt see me as anything else
- someone called me ‚Äúit‚Äù a few weeks ago. she‚Äôs in three of my classes and i still feel sick when i look at her 
- despite having been extremely politically active (especially for feminism) in the past i feel myself straying from that. i don‚Äôt have as strong emotions about issues in the media and i don‚Äôt even attend my school‚Äôs feminist club anymore 
- sometimes i feel trapped in my body, like when i‚Äôm in public wearing a tighter shirt 
- some days more than others, i find myself wanting traditionally male childhood experiences, like playing baseball or playing video games with male friends 
- right now everyone sees me as a lesbian, but i cant picture myself as an older lesbian or even an adult. 
- sometimes i feel homesick or nostalgic for experiences that aren‚Äôt mine? that‚Äôs the best way i can describe it

my problem is that sometimes i say or do feminine things that make me doubt myself. one big one has been crossing my legs. i don‚Äôt know any straight dudes who cross their legs. i could be bisexual but i think i confuse attraction for jealousy with guys sometimes? i‚Äôm really just stuck in a spiral of confusion.

428,2018-12-23 05:40:39,a8s9zo,1,1,"Hi all,

I'm wondering if you can help me with a little conundrum I have...

So I was born with a male body, I'm early 30s, and am exploring my gender identity as I'm really not certain what it is at this point. I'm thinking/daydreaming about what it would be like to live as a female pretty much a large portion of every day, so this is something I need to explore. I've created a list of all the possible things that could mean I identify as female. I'd like to find out if I'm exaggerating or obsessive, as I really have no frame of reference to judge that by. If you could have a look and give me your feedback, it'd be much appreciated!

(And yes, I realise the irony of having a female-name avatar, don't let that sway you!)

Here's a list of all traits/notes from as far back as I can remember...

Age 4 - 9
- Liked long hair
- Looked feminine, mistaken for girl
- Friends mostly girls
- Connected to girls better, both peers and adults/teachers, enjoyed hanging out with them more
- developed extreme pelvic floor tension that lasted well into adulthood (possibly related to a dislike of my male genitals? I have no recollection).

Age 9-11
- Fantasised about sex as a girl
- Would experiment dressing up in female clothes
- Disliked traditionally masculine clothes
- Felt uncomfortable going through puberty
- Hid the fact that my voice broke from my parents for months, really wanted to keep my high voice (yep, I went through puberty young).
- Sat down on the toilet to pee...

Age 11-13
- Pretended to be a girl in online chat rooms regularly
- Didn't like stubble growing

Age 13-18
- Occasionally tried wearing makeup
- Favoured female teachers, didn't connect to male ones
- Occasional to frequent dysphoria when looking in mirror or at photos, ongoing through adulthood, mainly about facial bone structure

Age 18+
- Tried wearing makeup on numerous occassions
- Love and connect way way more to literature and film/tv where a female is the protagonist instead of a man

Age 25+
- Used almost exclusively female avatars in all video games
- I don't relate to the stereotypical adult masculine traits, interests, or ways of life much at all.
- Used female avatars on social media before changing to neutral after starting a company, as public profiles became high visibility
- Some people think I'm female before knowing my birth gender when speaking online, they say based on how I communicate.
- I discovered, read, and became obsessed with all the twilight books in a week flat (before realising they obviously set a terrible example for young people and renouncing my 'fandom').
- Love lgbt and gender-exploratory programs like steven universe, especially relating to certain genderfluid and female characters
- love body-swap film/anime
- Continuous strong desire (or longing) to experiment dressing and acting like a woman - to the extent of watching tons of trans stories/videos, making trans female shopping lists, and learning and 'imaginary planning' if I were to undergo the process of transition in great detail
- Whenever I close my eyes and imagine my body as female, I feel a surge of relaxation and warmth, and my mind goes calm and tranquil
- When fantasising/daydreaming about 'magical/fantasy/sci-fi futures and scenarios', I'm.exclusively female in those fantasies

Other random notes that may (or may not) be useful:
- I prioritise emotional connection and empathy above all else in a relationship and friendships
- I've just experimented with waxing my chest/abs, and it feels goddamn fantastic. To clarify my sexuality here, I believe I'm pansexual, leaning strongly towards attraction to females.
- I've had some trauma as a child (nothing physical)
- I've had mental health issues most of my life, including strong anxiety, ocd, depression, (95% healed after years of work now. Never give up folks. Woop!)
- I don't have extreme gender dysphoria, but then again I don't have a strong connection to my body at all, especially with the aformentioned pelvic floor tension (working on it!)
- For those that know or care about mbti - and this is probably irrelevant - I'm INFJ.
- I don't hate my body, I just don't connect to it well.
- There's a lot about being a man that's enjoyable, but something just doesn't feel complete.
- I'm a 'problem solver' when trying to help people, so sometimes I come across as less empathetic (or stereotypically 'female') than I feel. I just value helping people in conjunction with listening, as opposed to just listening and doing nothing. Life's precious, and I believe problems should be solved and not left to stagnate.
- I find it hard to understand my true gender as I see myself as different from most of both genders. Society's full of toxic masculinity and femininity, so finding 'balanced' people to view as archetypes of their gender (or even understanding what that looks like) is a little challenging.
- People I relate to in fiction (I'm scraping the barrel, but the more info to help you help me, the better): Sabrina Spellman, Daenerys, Jon Snow, Mitsuha (the Your Name girl), Neo (yes, I know the trans allegory).



So... penny for your thoughts?
I'm only looking for opinions here as I'm just at the stage of consciously exploring my gender identity, I have no firm beliefs or plans or ideas, but I feel it's important to speak about this and get feedback from others who may be able to help piece things together.

Thanks in advance!

433,2018-12-23 18:59:20,a8x9ml,0,1,"Hello. Hope the day finds you well.

I've had several traumatic experiences with men along with a general lack of attraction to men and a strong attraction to women that leads me to believe I'm a lesbian. I use this identity and it feels right to me after a while of thinking I was bi or using these specialized labels to try and describe my complicated relationship with men. I've come to terms with being a lesbian quite recently after realizing that I'd never be with a man with a full peace of mind.

That being said I'm definitely attracted to penises. I hope this won't stir debate and I hope you all can respect how I identify. To me having a penis doesn't exactly mean being a man. I may have been raised with values like that but I've come to understand that gender is more complicated than ""Man Penis Woman Vagina"". I'm admittedly a very sexual person, probably another affect of the trauma I've endured, so satisfaction is very important to me.

Logically - simply in describing the feelings I experience - a pre-op trans woman would be ideal for me. I don't experience any lack of attraction to vaginas and I actually do enjoy sex with cis women. I just...really like dicks. Of course you have the whole strapon/dildo thing but somehow it wouldn't be the same.

I'm not here to debate the validity of my sexuality once again so please do not remark on that. This is nothing more than a physical thing. 

My question is: is the way I feel disrespectful to trans women? I don't want to be seen as a chaser. Admittedly back when Tumblr wasn't banning nsfw shit I was seeking trans women on Tumblr to speak to and occasionally sext with to fulfill myself.

I don't think I see trans women as sexual objects. If I do end up with a trans girl it won't merely be because she has a penis it'll be because I love her, but I'll be sexually satisfied as well. This doesn't mean that this is the end all be all for my relationships, it's just a preference. However I won't try and justify myself too much, as I'm open to criticism and I realise that me being cis does make my opinion on what is/isn't transphobic a little less valuable. 

Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading, if you made it. I hope I can get some insight from some of the trans folks (women in particular) on here.

440,2018-12-24 02:12:01,a90ros,1,1,"Hey, my name's Ryan and I'm ftm. I only came out a few months ago and so I understand that it's completely reasonable that my parents are going to need a lot more time to adapt and really come to terms with the fact that this is who I am. The thing that kind of sucks though, is that everyone else has been so unbelievably amazing. I came out to a few aunties, uncles and cousins (Ones I picked out, knowing they would be supportive and help) and they have been nothing but kind, supportive, and giving me advice whenever I've needed it. 

I even came out to my nan, who is pretty oldschool, and I really didn't expect it to go well. I was fully under the impression that she would never speak to me again, but as we're so close, I bit the bullet. She came down to see me in uni, we went out for food and talked. She even does her best to call me Ryan and he/him and will apologise if she forgets, which is so sweet because I'm well aware that it takes time. Once we discussed how much I've been hurting and how bad I feel in my body, she instantly understood and said she wants to do anything she can to make sure I'm happy. I cried when she introduced me one of her friends as her grandson. I don't know what I would do without her, honestly.

Also my housemates at uni have been great, there's even another trans guy in my house who's had a bit more experience so he's always there to talk if I need to and that helps a bunch. The rest of the house have to so accommodating and make me feel so right and good about myself.

My parents are the complete opposite, though. I came out to my mum on 3 separate occasions and she won't even acknowledge it, and neither will my dad. I'm also not really close enough with my siblings to discuss it with them but I know they'd be cool with it. I know it can be harder for parents than anyone, but the contract between the people who have been so supportive and helpful, and my parents, makes it all the more hard to swallow. As they haven't acknowledged it at all, it feels like they're never going to begin the process of thinking it over, as they just consistently deny it and change the subject whenever I try to talk. One thing my mum did say is that she will never be a part of any of it, and that no matter what she will always call me by my birth name. I'm hoping that isn't true and she does eventually come to terms with it, but it's a daunting idea nonetheless. She also will tell me that I'm ruining her life and that she just wishes I could be normal, which makes me feel super guilty for just existing. Having had her tell me that all my life, it feels like being trans is just added disappointed to her. 

I also have extremely bad anxiety, and so the idea of having to go alone to appointments and things related to something so big, is going to be hard. I have a doctor's appointment in the new year to discuss it and I won't lie I'm absolutely terrified. Someone without anxiety would probably even be scared, but I actually get heart palpitations and struggle to breathe just from thinking about it. I'm kind of scared that I won't be able to start off the medical side of my transition if I struggle to even go to the doctors to discuss being put on a long ass 2+ year waiting list. It almost feels like I'm never going to get anywhere and should just give up and be unhappy, save myself the disappointment later on down the line.

Having been at uni and living with people who have made me feel so comfortable and made me feel like a man, and then coming home to parents that refuse to even acknowledge my being trans, and will joke when calling me she/her and my birth name, is really taking it out of me. I feel so much more depressed since I came home, and have barely even been getting out of bed because of it. I know I can't expect them to accept it this early on, so the only thing that stops me from wanting to slice my throat is to just stay in my room away from all of it. 

Is there anything that I can do? You know to make myself feel better, more valid, more masculine? Because I am really missing that confident feeling I was having, and now I just feel so feminine and.. exposed.

This is a stressful time for all.

Whether you're alone or surrounded by people who think you're straight, refuse to accept you as gay, non-binary, pan, trans and so on, being alone and/or lonely can be really difficult if you haven't voiced your concerns and feelings.

I may not be able to describe that well but will give some key details cause I really want to watch it again. So I believe the plot was about this trans woman being transgender in high school and she lived in a trailer with her dad and mom that were kind of abusive to each other. Also they were very poor and buried the mom and dog in the backyard. Well she got bullied in high school I think and had nowhere safe to express herself.

1) Picking a name
   I've known I'm trans for nearly half my life now, the closest I've come to a name I'd be comfortable living with was a name my mom told me I would've been given had I been born female, I've always gravitated towards it since I found out although I was talking to one of my closest friends who I've recently came out to and he said the name didn't sound too fitting for me and that I should explore different names before committing to one. I think that's a great point and even though I have tried different names in the past it was at a time where I was still thinking about not transitioning altogether, which I do now and for the past year or so. My current name starts with an A as well as my middle name starting with a M, my family has always made it a huge thing that we share initials so finding something fitting with those initials has been hard. I just want to find something that I'd be comfortable with. 

2) Clothing
   Today I received many hyper-masculine clothing pieces to no surprise. I'm not out to my family but I don't know what I was expecting.

I've sort of realized that I've basically not done any to care for myself, maybe ever. I have a chronic, physical and mental illness on top of being trans and a disability. sometimes I wonder if people think I'm just a ""basket case"" who somehow fakes being all these things for points. Also sometimes I wonder if I pissed someone off in a past life or something. 

Anyway I was supposed to have the top surgery I've been needing all my life next month. But I could not drop to the weight the surgeon wanted in time. So that sucks.

Also I'm out to and temporarily living with immediate family, who call me her, she and a woman. I've just kind of given up on correcting it because it's exhausting. My mom tried to get it but was like ""ooh you want to be one of those women who pretend to be men"". She still thinks that way I guess.

I dunno how to life right now, I haven't been in touch with friends for over a month. I've been so low. And my doctor took me off T ""until my surgery"" but basically I think she's bought into terfy health scare stuff.

Sorry this is long and rambling but I just needed to spill my guts somewhere and ask for help and hope. If someone could share their positive outlooks, or find one in my story im overlooking, or just help me snap out of it, id be endlessly grateful. All the best

521,2018-12-28 01:57:47,aa5qv7,2,1,"Right, so I've been suffering with what I believe is almost \*definitely\* gender dysphoria for around a year and a half or so, but only realised it is probably that and the overwhelming severity of it fairly recently, as soon as a few months ago. I know I have memories that actually alluded to this in my childhood, such as wanting to do girly things, disliking boy-like things, etc and the changes I'm going through right now in my later stages of puberty are making me sick to the stomach because they're masculine changes. I hate it. I want my physical masculinity aesthetically gone now.

The issue here is that I'm pretty certain my family won't be very accepting of this, or might not even understand and this potential disapproval might hinder me from getting any sort of help, and on top of that my girlfriend will probably have to leave me due to her sexuality as she has mentioned to me before when I have brought this topic up.

As with most people, my biggest worry is that I won't come out of the transition feeling as if my body is that of a female and that I won't be able to shape myself up to be the ideal self I've always wanted to be.

For the record, I'm 17 and from the UK. Whilst I can legally just go see my GP myself, I'm not exactly free from the whole parental jazz just yet. Plus I've never actually gone to see my GP myself and I've never really been to my GP in a loooooooong time (we're literally talking years here, I don't even know who my GP is).

My main question really is how should I go about starting the long, looooong transition process, right from the first GP appointment? I would ask if it's worth me even doing this but at this point I can't take it anymore, it's really painful. I attached a picture of myself just in case anyone wants to see what I look like as a male, and judge whether I can eventually look like the gender I feel like I should've been born as (obviously with lots of exercise and actually good sleep along with the therapy and what not because fuuuuuuuuuck me I don't like how fat I am either and my eyebags are horrific).

This is one of the arguments I don't have a good answer for: he said that trans people don't accept reality. I said they're not accepting a social construct of the gender binary being framed as an objective/biological truth. My friend rebutted that, if a trans person wants to get sex reassignment surgery, then it means that it's their sex that they want to change and not their gender. I couldn't think of a good response to that. 

His overall point seems to be: if gender is just a social construct, then why do trans people want to change their physical genitalia instead of only their gender presentation?

In retrospect, a good rebuttal might have been to say that trans people who want surgery want it because the genitalia they have is a part of their gender presentation that is important to them. I guess I don't know if that's actually why trans people want the surgery, though.

I'm an 18yr old girl, I'm very happy with dressing female and having my face look female etc, but I'm not happy with my physical body.

I have an extremely flat chest which I do love. But I'm not happy at all with my genitals. I've wished for so many years now that I had a penis.

I don't know what to do, as I dont always want to look Male when it comes to my looks and face ect. I'm actually quite happy with all of that.

It's just my genitals. I feel like I am missing what I should have.

Anyone who can help? I feel so conflicted.

This is mostly just for self confirmation/Getting it all down in one place.

So let's get to it, chronologically.

‚Ä¢ Had very girly tendencies in my first few years of elementary, quickly learned to stop because of the way people responded (The hardest of these was raising one of my back legs anytime I hugged my ""girlfriend"").

‚Ä¢ Was much better at being friends with girls mid-elementary all the way through Jr. High. Again faded out due to the oddness of it.

‚Ä¢ Wanted my hair to be long. Longer. Father would always make me cut it short.

‚Ä¢ Came out as Bi in Jr High, would feel amazing to swoon at boys with the two girls in my percussion section. Thought it was just sexuality confirmation.

‚Ä¢ Became extremely jealous of girls hair and clothing. Thought every male just felt this way.

‚Ä¢ Played the points game almost every night I could on Omegle. A really gross game that made me feel femenine, shrugged this off as my sexuality as well.

‚Ä¢ Was gender non-conforming for a good part of the beginning of high school. Wore this unicorn hoodie religiously until I decided I needed to fit in better.

‚Ä¢ Took thousands of shirtless selfies at a super upward angle because of the curves of my tummy, again decide it's just my gayness.

‚Ä¢ Puberty starts. Weird feelings when looking in the mirror commence, also feel that this is normal and everyone has this.

‚Ä¢ Self care totally non existent.

‚Ä¢ Hated shopping for my own clothes. Loved it when my Mom asked my opinion on clothes she wanted to buy.

‚Ä¢ Dressed the same from Jr. High all the way to end of High School. Never mixed it up, why would I it all sucks anyway?

‚Ä¢ Basically feel that the female sex is better in every way and daydream about being born a girl.

‚Ä¢ As I lose my femanine figure become jealous of females bodies. Think every male feels this way.

‚Ä¢ Begin envisioning myself as the female in any type of explicit content I watch.

‚Ä¢ Junior year begin disassociating for full days at least a few times a week. Didn't know what to make of this but didn't mind it either?

‚Ä¢ Also begin crying endlessly after work at the empty mall parking lot in my car at least three times a week. My only explanation was ""I just need to do this."" Did not know why. No reason to be sad?

‚Ä¢ Never let any of my exes do my makeup from the terror of knowing I'll love it.

‚Ä¢ Never cross dress in any situation from fear I'd love it.

‚Ä¢ Off to college, Mirror thing keeps getting worse. Decide I'm not manly enough and start working out fervently as well as eating an insane amount to build muscle.

‚Ä¢ Basically have the perfect male body and it's even worse. Quit. Don't analyze it at all.

‚Ä¢ Move in with current fiance, talk about their trans bro and become more open to the topic.

‚Ä¢ Research Research. Oh normal people don't feel that mirror thing and it's called dysphoria? Maybe there's another explanation ...

‚Ä¢ Finally try on girls clothes for the first time at 19. Euphoria off the fucken charts.

^ And that's the straw that broke the T-Girls back.
I decided I needed to do something now and was on HRT within a Month and Half.

Over a year HRT, 9 months presenting and 7 months out to everyone including family.

548,2018-12-29 20:43:25,aaosyk,1,1,"Hello, I am a 20 year old heterosexual cis woman who was up until a month ago dating a heterosexual cis man. The day before Thanksgiving I was talking with my partner and our mutual friends on our discord, when all of the sudden they say that they do not feel like they are 100% a man anymore, that they don't quite know what they are or who they want to be but it is not what they are now, physically. 

I panicked and freaked out. Where my other friends were very kind and supportive, I felt like I was in shock. I didn't know what to do or how to feel and ended up questioning our relationship that up until that point I had never done. This was the person I was with for almost 4 years, and someone who has been in my life for over 10 years, a person who up until that point without a doubt I could say I wanted to marry and be with forever. We haven't broken up or anything but it's been really difficult. I'm a very easy crier and I have just been having breakdowns on a weekly basis since that point, and going through phases of either not caring if my partner wants to be my partner and not my boyfriend, and other phases where I just want to leave them and crawl in a whole and die. It seemed as though as soon I was starting to accept something a new change would happen which would kind of cause a stress cycle that I cannot get out of. (Ex. going from shaving entire body to want to be called by new pronouns to want to be called by a new name ect ect...)

Since that point they have had some time to think about it, and have realized that they were not gender-less or non binary as they had originally said, but more like a woman.

I'm visiting my parents for the holidays and my brother decided he wanted to clean out a closet with things from the kids' childhoods. So I spent an hour reading through papers and digging up memories that I didn't know I still had from elementary school (about 10 years old). The thing is, in these papers I show every indication of being a stereotypical boy interested in stereotypical boy things. My notebook was full of crude drawings of planes shooting each other and blowing up, stick figure armies at war with poorly drawn guns and trails of dots and dashes to represent the paths of bullets. Hey, don't judge the macabre topics. I was 10 and it was 1990s USA where things like G.I. Joe were marketed straight at me.

(tangentially, i'm also increasingly convinced from reading these papers that I had some level of attention deficit as a child, something I've suspected for a while)

But sitting here now in a dress, having realized suddenly in my 30s that I want to be a woman and that I have wanted that for a very very long time, it really hurts to see how 'boy' I was back then. It hurts to see how neatly I used to fit into a stereotypical mold that I'm actively rejecting today.

I know intellectually that not 'knowing I was trans since I was 4' is fine, that the standard trans narrative was mostly created for cis people, and that the narrative is quite harmful to anyone who didn't have that experience.

It seems almost silly to be upset by not finding signs of gender issues in a 4th grade scratch-pad. But somehow it still hurts, like intellectual arguments can only get you so far.

I have one or two other gender non-conforming memories or stories from pre-puberty childhood that I cling to. 'Evidence' that I'm trans that I intellectually don't think I should need, but secretly still bring me some small comfort and so I still cling to.

However, now I have a new issue: guys that I befriend. \nI\'ve always had a problem not figuring out when someone is interested in me until it\'s too late but since accepting that I\'m a guy and presenting masculine, I figured it wouldn\'t be a problem anymore. \nSo now that I am fully and truly one of the guys, I just befriend anyone because I feel like I\'m safe to do that without someone getting confused or feelings hurt. I laugh at their jokes and talk with them openly and I\'m overall a very chill dude but I think that\'s still translating as interest for some. Like it\'s getting to the point where one of the guys I befriended just wants to be around me all the time and goes out of his was to talk to me and be creepy. \nSo my question is this: when will the creepy guys that don\'t know the difference between platonic and romantic stop being interested in me? After I start T? After surgery? Also what do I do to avoid situations like this in the furture? ', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'When will the creepy men go away???', 'created': 1546205223.0}"

I'm renegotiating my salary next week, and I'm pulling up data from a few different sources online. PoCs, LGBTQIA, those with mental and physical disabilities and other minority groups are paid less than cis white men. So, in part, this poll will help me provide some backing for my negotiations-but I'd also like to see those of us that represent oppressed groups have an open discussion about this stuff and hopefully gain a few tools to fight this. 

You do NOT have to tell me how much you make, or even what you do. I'm just looking for how accurate these figures are compared to what you're currently making. These are also (possibly) helpful free tools if you're planning on negotiating too. Just let me know which sites you check out, and give poll responses like this:

L=much lower (lower by 5k)

R=round about ballpark to what you're making now (within 5k)

H=Much higher (higher than 5k)

\-US Department of Labor Statistics : [https://www.bls.gov/](https://www.bls.gov/) 

\-ERI's [salaryexpert.com](https://salaryexpert.com/) search engine (This is the easiest one to get a figure from.) 

\-Payscale: [https://www.payscale.com/](https://www.payscale.com/) 

\-GlassDoor: [https://www.glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/) 

Side note: I did a similar survey with pals on Facebook, about 60 responses. From what I was able to gather, those of us in tech in larger cities were getting paid a bit more than the salaryexpert figures, while those in rural/smaller areas were paid less.

8,2018-12-03 10:38:37,a2nj4m,3,1,"Hi all!

Long post incoming, but there‚Äôs a summary at the end ;)

I‚Äôm a 33 yr old genderfluid person, something I‚Äôve started to realize about 1.5yr ago. I‚Äôm AMAB but have always been quite feminine in my mannerisms, communication style, etc etc, something I‚Äôve been bullied with or have tried to change to conform to expectations for most of my life. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm married to a straight girl from a small-town conservative family. She‚Äôs still getting used to the fact that I‚Äôm expressing myself more femme when I feel like it, but she‚Äôs trying to be supportive. Actually, almost everyone I know had been super awesome about it, and apparently my coming out wasn‚Äôt much of a surprise to many people (often heard; ‚Äúit kinda makes sense‚Äù).

The exception: my wife‚Äôs parents. They live in a small village in a part of the country that‚Äôs very homogenous in terms of culture and ethnicity; they even speak a different local language. (Frisian, a minority language in the Netherlands. Fun fact: it‚Äôs the language that‚Äôs most closely related to English).

So, when I came out last year, they were very concerned about their daughter, and asked her questions and made assumptions like:

-How could she be happy like this?
-I would never be able to find a new job.
-Obviously this meant I didn‚Äôt want children.
-Men wearing makeup is disgusting.
-I probably waited until after my dad had passed away because they figured he would‚Äôve had difficulty accepting it. (Actually I know he was secretly into crossdressing, and I would‚Äôve loved to share it with him).

Yeah. Luckily my wife was also like: wtf!? We had some talks with them, and they now see that, while they still don‚Äôt understand it, at least I‚Äôm still the same person, and my wife is (mostly) happy with me. 

But, of course, the holidays meant visiting them.  Usually I kinda dress in a way that makes me feel confident- whether it‚Äôs more masc or femme depends on the situation and my mood, although I prefer looking cute with some makeup, leaning towards feminine. Especially for an occasion such as the holidays I want to feel okay and not dysphoric or anything... 

So, whilst planning stuff for the visit, my wife asked me if I would please present masculine, just wearing trousers and a shirt or jumper, maybe only light makeup -at most-. When I asked why, she explained that she didn‚Äôt want her parents to feel awkward, which would also make her feel awkward as a result. She felt quite anxious about it... which I totally get, as I also often struggle with what I feel comfortable with in which situation; and it can be scary to face people who might react negatively to your appearance.

This lead to a discussion and quite an argument in the end though: I explained that, of course, I would dress in a way that I would feel would be okay, but that I wanted to also be able to do what feels okay for me. If I always dress in a way to not make people uncomfortable or confused or whatever, I‚Äôd never be able to do what I want (I‚Äôve done that for about 30yrs already- conforming to gender expectations). She countered by saying that everyone plays roles sometimes and dresses appropriately according to a situation- and that it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal to just wear something I often wear. 

To me, it wasn‚Äôt so much the actual wearing something more masculine, but in the end, I guess it comes down to acceptance and being able to be myself. In the end I just wore some jeans and a random (masc) T-shirt that I felt okay in, but it did leave a sour taste...

I was wondering if/how others deal with this. It feels kinda shitty that my wife basically asked me to pretend I‚Äôm not genderfluid, but I do get where she‚Äôs coming from, as she just wanted a fun night with her family without any fuss or awkwardness. Yet, this did mean it made it more difficult for me. I teach classes on gender and sexuality to teens, and I‚Äôm aware of the importance of exposure in changing people‚Äôs ideas. So if I‚Äôm always hiding that part when I‚Äôm with them, they‚Äôll never learn and be okay with it...

I'm a very shy person, so I wait for someone to approach me when I meet people.

I'm wondering if anyone else here has experienced something similar? Is there some kind of explanation? So far, all I've come up with is that they have no idea how to approach me because they don't know what ""gender script"" to follow.

Also please excuse or be understanding of any non pc terminology I might use, I feel like I don‚Äôt know all the nuances of it or what terms mean what exactly.

-I was identified male at birth.
-I have been diagnosed as being on the extreme upper end of the gifted spectrum (i.e. profoundly gifted) and gifted people tend to be more ‚Äúandrogynous‚Äù (so I discovered and found to be validating), and I am and have been.
-Because I grew up in a religious environment my sexuality has been fairly suppressed throughout my life but as I‚Äôve come out of religion I find clues about it through my turn on‚Äôs.
-In general I‚Äôve found the whole ‚Äúsissy‚Äù genre to really resonate, though the term itself does not. I am submissive sexually and I guess sissy stuff would be a fetish, but I am unsure of how that squares with my gender identity on a more holistic level.
-I‚Äôve called myself ‚Äúbi-flexible,‚Äù but I‚Äôve only dated cis women.
-So far the only term that I‚Äôve found that I resonated with was ‚Äútwo spirit‚Äù but then I found out that you can only be that if you‚Äôre Native American and I‚Äôm not sure if I have any of that in my genes.
-I think I resonated with ‚Äútwo spirit‚Äù because I am a very spiritual person (to provide some labels/terms: mysticism, non-duality) and feel like the complexity of my sexuality and gender expression and identity stems from my inner wholeness and Self which is actually more ‚Äúyin‚Äù than yang.
-My ideal partner would probably be a more dominant yang energy woman who would appreciate and celebrate me in my more yin/feminine expression and, at times, appearance.
-I can somewhat pass as being both male and female depending on the clothes I wear and how I present.
-Though I‚Äôm fairly new to exploring and questioning more about all this, I really relate to everything I‚Äôve seen from Joseph Harwood in terms of expression, energy and appearance.
-I inhabit aspects of both traditional gender stereotypes - e.g. playing sports but being very sensitive and tuned into relationships, being fairly cerebral and intellectual but also heart centered, enjoying video games and art, music etc. These are the things I mean by being androgynous.

I was assigned female at birth and growing up I was always considered a tomboy, and in my teens I started going for a more androgynous/masc look.

Now a days I feel comfortable with my feminine side and express it more when I'm in the mood.

I've gone through some traumatic experiences that put me in therapy and at first my therapist assumed I may hate feminity because of them, but later she discovered and straight up told me that I am genderfluid.

Gender and sexuality weren't things that were really discussed in my home, I was assumed cis and am expected to be straight.

Now I'm taking the time to figure out who I am, so most of the time I feel ambigous genderwise, but I have more masc leaning days and more fem leaning days. 

So if I want people to understand me better should I just say I'm nonbinary? Or should I say I'm genderfluid? Can I say both??

As an introduction: I'm a white male in the age of 31, and always identified myself as heterosexual, and never thought, that something even close would hit me.

The thing is, I never agreed about anything with so called ""genderist"", nor do I now, but accidentally I crashed into Riley J. Dennis on the internet. One of his videos was posted on a ""hate"" thread, and I wanted to know what is she talking about. She talks too fast, barely one or two things can be understood by me, but at one point, I got a rather strange turn on. Some seconds later, I noticed my cock was diamonds like never before.... OMG WHAT THE HELL???

At the end of her video, I just sat on my chair before the laptop with an almost exploding boner, and all I wanted was her, to destroy my narrow minded cock with her beauty, and make me lost in her astonishing, brilliant eyes. As I'm writing these rows of text, still feel crazy...

I wish I knew more about her, somehow get in deep contact or relationship, but this has little chance, since I am not in the U.S.

41,2018-12-08 19:29:17,a4dozv,10,1,"Hi, I hope this is the right place to post this. I've realized a few months ago that I'm probably gender queer, gender-fluid or nonbinary. I'm 23 and AFAB. I'm somehow worried (I think a lot of people are) of using the concept wrongly or appropriating it unlegitimately. I don't know if the feeling of discomfort that I feel towards femininity can actually be considered dysphoria. People around me are pretty open minded (I hang out around the polyam community a lot), so I can tell them about my questionning but I don't know many people I could talk to who actually relate. 

As a kid I've had some very feminine (barbie dolls and princesses) phases, and some phases where all my friends were boys and I wanted to be ""one of the boys"" really bad. I've always been more of an intellectual type, and way too bad at sports to be a tomboy in the usual sense. I'm also very small. My parents did not really discourage me from playing with either ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" toys even though they took for granted that I would like feminine things. (They did not disapprove me when I would wear boy's clothes that I borrowed from my friends occasionally). My mother works in a male dominated field and generaly has positions that are pretty much second-wave feminism. She used to be a bit transphobic (she understood that people might want to dress/behave like any gender they want but did not understand that people would want to modify their body to match that), but she has become more open minded now.

As a teenager, I had a looooot of internalized sexism. I would say that I was not like ""the other girls"" because girls are superficial or cause too much drama (which, as we know, is simply false). I simultaneously wanted boys to consider me one of their own while at the same time wanting them to be sexually/romantically interested in me, which could only happen if I looked feminine enough. So I dressed and looked relatively feminine. I sometime told myself "" I wish I were a man, but I could not become one with this body because I would be way too small and weak to be a man"".

As a young adult (or would that be ""late teens"" in English? like 17 to 20 yo), I've been in a long term abusive relationship with an extremely misogynistic guy. It was very hard to get over all the sexist ideas he had put in my head. I'm also a philosophy student, and philosophy has this tradition of being very male-centered, and I somehow related with that tradition. 

Then I started being interested in feminism, questioning gender roles and identifiying my own internalized sexism. I also became conscious that I was pansexual. I stopped trying to look interesting/attractive to men, because I grew more confident and was able to tell myself that people I was interested in had to be able to deal with who I am. I cut my hair short, I stopped shaving body hair, I started dressing more comfortable. 

Then I started questioning my gender identity. I feel uncomfortable (and maybe dysphoric) when people adress me too feminine compliments (such as telling me I'm pretty), when male partners (esp if they're straight) compliment my body. I feel most of the time uncomfortable about my breasts (I wear undersized sports bras to hide them) and very thankfull that they are not naturally too big. I feel a lot of height dysphoria. I feel small, weak and I feel that if I were to transition to masculinity, I would never pass. I compare myself to my male partners/friends a lot. When I talk to men (esp a group of men), I'm always very aware of how tall they are compared to me. I mostly wear men's clothes but they're always a bit too big and look ""borrowed"". I like when my girlfriend says I'm handsome or uses masculine pronouns (neutral pronouns are hard to use in French, I do use them but she doesn't know how to, and they definitely are not convenient). I don't think I actually want to be a man. I'm very aware that my socialization as a woman is a big part of who I am and I feel like I can't erase that (and don't really want to). I mostly want to be perceived as androgynous I think. Which is hard because I'm tiny. Some days I look at pictures of trans men and I wish I had a beard and a flat chest and other days I feel comfortable considering myself a queer woman and using she/her pronouns. I'm generally always uncomfortable about doing things that are perceived as girly, and I wonder if that's internalized sexism too (I do like these things on other people though). 

TL;DR (and conclusion): I'm worried that by calling myself genderqueer or gender-fluid, or wanting to use neutral pronouns, I'm just appropriating the struggles of people who struggle more than me, or that it's just a new ""post-feminist"" type of internalized sexism. I also don't know if my use of the word ""dysphoria"" is legitimate.

53,2018-12-10 16:54:39,a4xdef,3,1,"Hi everyone, I just wanted to vent

I'm lying in bed on this Monday morning after having a horrible episode of panic at work earlier that caused me to go home. I feel like a complete and utter failure that I let it effect me in this way.

My pants fit wonderfully but are too baggy, my shoes are hand me downs and too big for my feet. At this sub's suggestions, I'm going to try to go thrifting tonight with the help of my roommate, but at this moment I feel hopeless. All that's going through my head is my former friend laughing and telling me I'm butch even on days where I felt femme and beautiful. Am I trying to be something I'm not?

I don't want to be stuck feeling ""between"" two genders, I want to pick one and be happy with it. I want my hair to cooperate and not stick up at wild angles just because it's short.

In general, I think the best advice is to be kind and compassionate to yourself. Cut yourself some slack when things get you down, allow yourself to feel that this is you, that you get to define your feelings and that your feelings are valid. Because they are. Maybe you don't feel that you are reacting in a socially acceptable or 'correct' way, but they are your reactions and your feelings. Take the time to have them before you try to analyse and understand them. Otherwise they become bottled.

Maybe you already have coping strategies, maybe you already have an end-point in mind, maybe you don't. Whatever, research and learn - about the situations you can face and about yourself. Look into how others cope with it. Protect yourself if you have to - so don't do research at work or where others may track what you are doing. But do research. Seek out safe spaces to discuss your feelings on matters.

Maybe doing something that feels affirming will help you out as well. My friend and I created a short documentary film that asks some of these questions to a gender-non-conforming musician and how music and spirituality has played a vital role in their process of dealing with gender dysphoria.

And only AFTER the fact has it started to occur to me that maybe some of these things I've felt, like not feeling confortable being called a man or prefering to be grouped with women, could in fact be part of a gender dysphoria that has gone unnoticed until now.

In addition to that, I've had a talk with a friend who also identifies as genderqueer and we shared our experiences about being uncomfortable with our male anatomy. Now, I'm already very uncomfortable with my body because of my looks in general, so I thought it was just regular body dysphoria over being overweight and what not, but in that moment it kind of clicked that if my average weight friend who also identifies as genderqueer experiences the exact same kind of discomfort, it could very well be part of gender dysphoria. And ever since that realization I've started to notice these things even more.

Even though I didn't grow much facial hair and despite having had breast growth (even though I was relatively skinny), I hated my body and knew sometime in college that I was trans. I thought that because I was amab, that this meant that I had to transition to female. I was privileged to have access to hormones and therapy, but now that I'm nearly 2 and a half years into transition I can't ignore the fact that I hate stereotypically ""womanly"" self presentation. I would really stress out about makeup, even though I was good at it. I also hated heels, dresses, and even long hair (but kept it long because I was afraid of being visibly trans). I would normally wear sweaters and jean, and I was lucky that I passed really well as a cis woman, but that's just it, I don't feel like a woman at all. But I feel right in this new body, I'm okay with my breasts and I want to have bottom and facial feminization surgeries in the future.

For me I realised that the majority of the time I was ""meh"" towrads gender, I didnt really care, I just felt I had stereotypically male persionality traits and and then a few more stereotypically female personality traits. Depending on occasion I would express one more than the other and the rest of the time just be quite andro. 

However I'm coming to realise that whilst at times I like expressing male and others female I am becoming more uncomfortable with being physically male. Its not to do with having dysphoria about sexual organs, but more - I never think I'll look feminine enough, but equally its more than that? I don't really know how to explain. 

Basically if I had it my way I wish I could have been born female but then present my Genderqueer identity through presenting masculinish most of them time but still be feminine enough to pull off miniskirts, crop tops, dresses ect. without looking like a 6'3 somewhat masculine man in drag (which unless Im doing drag I don't want). Basically think Bex Taylor-Klaus, I wish I could be her. So yeah, mostly this was just to put things into words but if anyone has any help I'd love to know what you say.

Comparably, when society was fighting for equal gay marriage right, I had already had several gay friends, so I already had an idea if concepts such as they didn't just one day choose to be gay, nobody can force them to be straight, and trying to do so has proven in the past to be incredibly damaging. I saw that older generations had to hide it, while newer generations were becoming more accepting.

In addition, when the transgender movement was getting more media attention, I saw examples of individuals who knew from an early age that their inside gender identity didn't match their assigned gender at birth.  I saw again that the older generations had to hide it, while newer generations were becoming more accepting. 

Gender fluid is new to me.  

1. Has there always been a subset of individuals experiencing gender fluidity that they had to hide, such as to just go with the flow in society? 

2. Is it likely to always stick around for the rest of her life, such as with gay and trans, they don't outgrow it, it just always sticks around? 

3. How do you navigate the reality that society simply doesn't want to keep up with one individual feeling/presenting masculine or feminine one day to the next?  I promise I don't want to say this offensively but what I know about society in general is that people often just want a fixed explanation and some might be willing to say ""ok i used to know this person as a woman but now he's a man so I'll get used to saying him and he"" but if someone is changing their identity on a whim then most of society is going to get frustrated with expecting to keep up or being blamed for using the wrong pronoun on any given day.

But they still get really frustrated that some detail they think should be fixed is still continually changing and unpredictable.  How do I help my daughter accept that society will want some fixed idea of her, such as as a girl,  even on days she doesn't feel like a girl? 

4. Is it damaging to her psyche to suggest just keeping it to herself for the most part?

I've been wanting to start a conversation about gender, and possibly coming out to them as genderqueer. I know that they'd all be very accepting, especially considering almost none of them are straight and a handful aren't cis either. It just seems like before they came out, the few I knew back then, they were kind of similar to me in some aspects of personality - just quiet, reserved people who never talked much. And when they came out, it's like the dam burst and their real personalities came out of the closet with them. Over the years that we've all been friends, I know and they know that I've grown a lot as a person, getting more comfortable being around them and talking to them. I know I still come off as quiet and reserved though.

But I keep noticing that they'll all hangout together and go places together, get drunk together, go to pride and drag shows together, etc, but never invite me to join. I usually have to be the one to initiate events that include me, or push my way into an event or hangout. Last night, a few of us went out for a late dinner, just hanging out and being friends and all. The conversation got to the topic of love lives and sex lives. It was something the me from 5 years ago would've run out the door for, and it seems like they still see me as that person. I just want to be able to hangout and laugh and joke with them without them thinking they have to censor the conversation. As we left the place, they were all apologizing to me for the conversation, as well as making plans to hangout later to continue the conversation. I talked to another friend about this later that night (she graduated last year and moved away), and she said that most people view me as the ""innocent, quiet friend"", the ""too pure for this world"" friend.

I kind of understand if they think I'm uncomfortable with the conversation because I rarely contribute to the more love and sex life topics, but I honestly don't have anything to contribute because I've felt so uncomfortable with myself for years, only to discover that I'm uncomfortable because I'm not straight or cis. And I feel like sometimes they exclude me from these hangouts and conversation because they think of me as too innocent, too pure, too straight/cis, to feel comfortable with the conversation. But I also shouldn't have to come out to everyone as a sort of pass to become closer friends. And part of that is on me for being so reserved, but I guess I've been so reserved all my life out of fear of being myself.

I love my friends, and I want them to know the real me, and I want to be able to get closer to them. But I don't know how to do that when they can't see me as anything but innocent and pure. And I'm afraid that if I do come out to them, it'll be seen as me trying to get into a fad and faking it all. They already try to not assume gender or sexuality when new people join our friend group, but I feel like I was an exception to that rule and seen as nothing but straight/cis. I'm starting to think that maybe I'll just deal with this until graduation in the spring, and then ""transition"" into my real self over the summer so that I can be more of myself in grad school.

It was something the me from 5 years ago would\'ve run out the door for, and it seems like they still see me as that person. I just want to be able to hangout and laugh and joke with them without them thinking they have to censor the conversation. As we left the place, they were all apologizing to me for the conversation, as well as making plans to hangout later to continue the conversation. I talked to another friend about this later that night (she graduated last year and moved away), and she said that most people view me as the ""innocent, quiet friend"", the ""too pure for this world"" friend.\n\nI kind of understand if they think I\'m uncomfortable with the conversation because I rarely contribute to the more love and sex life topics, but I honestly don\'t have anything to contribute because I\'ve felt so uncomfortable with myself for years, only to discover that I\'m uncomfortable because I\'m not straight or cis. And I feel like sometimes they exclude me from these hangouts and conversation because they think of me as too innocent, too pure, too straight/cis, to feel comfortable with the conversation. But I also shouldn\'t have to come out to everyone as a sort of pass to become closer friends. And part of that is on me for being so reserved, but I guess I\'ve been so reserved all my life out of fear of being myself.\n\nI love my friends, and I want them to know the real me, and I want to be able to get closer to them. But I don\'t know how to do that when they can\'t see me as anything but innocent and pure. And I\'m afraid that if I do come out to them, it\'ll be seen as me trying to get into a fad and faking it all. They already try to not assume gender or sexuality when new people join our friend group, but I feel like I was an exception to that rule and seen as nothing but straight/cis. I\'m starting to think that maybe I\'ll just deal with this until graduation in the spring, and then ""transition"" into my real self over the summer so that I can be more of myself in grad school.

Somehow I wish I could have a chest that LOOKS masculine but FEELS the way it does now, with sensitivity to the nipples and at least some volume (could be muscle + fat in a typically male chest?) but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs achievable and I‚Äôm afraid how top surgery would affect the feeling (depending on what kind of surgery they would go with would in worst case scenario reduce feeling to almost none, from what I‚Äôve heard). And I wonder if testosterone can make certain parts of your body less sensitive? Or like centre the feeling to down there during sex?

And I still haven‚Äôt figured out what I am. Transmasculine? Gender fluid? Nonbinary? Bigender? Socially I say I‚Äôm a gender nonconforming (and/or nonbinary) transman, I‚Äôve used a masc coded name and he/they pronouns for a few months. I started getting dysphoric about things like lack of some bottom parts, voice, chest back in 2016, before that I had unexplained anxiety since I became a teenager. I‚Äôm 26 now. I was deep in the closet both with gender and sexuality. I‚Äôm pan but statistically more into a certain kind of masculine ppl, sometimes I relate heavily to the male gay community (which has it‚Äôs own problematics).

I have my femme side when presenting, but I see it not that much related to gender but general expression of self. More along the lines of men dressing cute and doing makeup to look good, or doing drag, not to really present a female identity. And I do want to look &amp; feel flat chested in EVERY other situation but sex. It‚Äôs really strange... I mean I wish I could go topless to the beach, not bind but still be flat etc, but somehow I don‚Äôt always feel like this in sexual situations?

I‚Äôm starting to think this is some next level splitting between body and mind shit, or trying to hang on to aspects of my ‚Äùlost‚Äù femininity... I have borderline personality disorder and feel like I haven‚Äôt had a coherent identity or personality all my life (I didn‚Äôt question my gender before 2015, my ‚Äùegg‚Äù cracked when I came into touch with a trans guy through work). 

But at the same time, I don‚Äôt doubt being transgender because I definitely don‚Äôt feel like a woman, or female, in any other way than when it comes to sex. I (still) enjoy very stereotypical ‚Äùfemale‚Äù ways of being pleased. (And I‚Äôm pretty much a bottom). I‚Äôve tried other things (like strapping on) but since I‚Äôm ‚Äùwired‚Äù this way some things just feel natural...while others feel good as a fantasy but don‚Äôt work irl. 

TL;DR; I mostly want to feel &amp; look flat, I get annoyed by my chest sometimes if I‚Äôm not binding, the feeling of it sensory wise and sometimes more dysphoric, and try to ‚Äùmould‚Äù it with my hands to see what it would look like as flat, fantasize about it even, but then during sex (including masturbation..) it becomes a very central part that I want to have touched, and I fear I would miss it if I were to alter my body through medical transitioning. 

So idk ;__; I also want to have long hair, not that keen about body hair, and want to go for a low-key goth androgynous style, some days makeup and some days not. I know I can do and be like anything, as nonbinary/gnc, but still these things confuse me as I don‚Äôt know whether to settle or to go for changes. Not deciding to transition with hormones and top surgery feels like it‚Äôs invalidating my masculine side, and would make it impossible to correct my papers, name etc. Where I live, one needs to have gone through the evaluation process, get the ‚Äùbinary‚Äù transgender diagnosis and be on hormones for 1 y or otherwise sterile to correct the identity information.

26,2018-12-06 18:15:46,a3qk8o,1,1,"Hi, my name is JubJub and I just wanted to introduce myself and discuss my experiences/thoughts/stuff while getting your thoughts/experiences/stuff on being gender fluid. I am AMAB but identity as gender fluid going between male/female/agender.

tldr will be at the bottom.

So basic background info, history of mental health issues, depression in remission due to meds, anxiety getting better due to new meds and CBT

So now that's out the way. After the change of meds and starting CBT I started exploring my gender identity again now that I was jumping at my own shadow due to bad meds. 

So in the past I have had days that I would get easier frustrated, annoyed and tetchy for no apparent reason (would happen maybe once or twice a week), and I being encouraged to be introspective I thought about why this would be happening. Didn't work at first.

Then I did something I did before the mad meds and get rid of the body hair on my upper half. And oh did it give me gender euphoria, my partner even commented on my improved mood. Had none of the days I mentioned above for a week, and then, like the tide, the hair starts growing back in earnest and I get hit by a really bad day.

At the end on of the day I think about what could have caused it. And then it clicks into place, I was not comfortable in my body as it was and I hated people calling me by my male name at work. So I do a little research and talked to partner and come up with the idea that it could be gender dysphoria?

After this I made a post on Facebook coming out to my friends as a whole that I am gender fluid, not family, they are mildly transphobic and telling them currently is a nope. I go into details about that I'm open  to friends but not the public due to the industry I work in and the likelihood I would run into a regular customer and so on. This went really well with people being supportive. 

Then come to last Wednesday at work, hating it and having one of those days. Then I get a really bad intrusive thought, I have had intrusive thoughts before but nothing this intense or graphic and this one gender based. This scared me, while I would never and have never acted upon intrusive thoughts, that it was that intense, graphic or specific before. Thankfully I had a meeting with a mental health nurse the next day.

So from that they have referred me on to a psychiatrist who deals with this kind of thing for my area, though I am still waiting for a call to arrange an appointment. And this gets down to the crux of it all, what do I want? I know what I want(ish). I want to be able to express my gender identity in public/at work without discrimination/prejudice/hate or judgement by other people, I assume this is want most if not all people want. But that isn't something I can change. So changing myself, I want to know what options I have as gender fluid person in the UK dealing with the NHS?

tldr; I'm an AMAB gender fluid individual going between male/female/agender and I'm looking for advice about options available for where I am?

I'm AMAB and have really felt like bigender is right after working through various other points and identifications (crossdress, TS, trans, etc.) I really enjoy my male life. I spend 95 percent of my time that way, but I've felt bits of femme creeping in and wanting to express more often and more regularly. My nails are painted a pretty neutral color right now, and I love the feel of having polish on them. I started using they/them pronouns more publicly. I'm feeling more comofrtable to wear whatever underwear i feel like on a given day.

102,2018-12-19 09:32:09,a7kxnf,1,1,"Disclaimer: Long, venty, and rambly. I'll be honest I'm mostly trying to work through my feelings and stress right now.

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part, I mostly just lurk Reddit and participate rarely in just a couple of subreddits (this one included). But since I lurk more subreddits than I post in, I sometimes see posts in the vein of ""nonbinary/agender/genderfluid is stupid and made up,"" or ""so many people claiming to be trans/nonbinary/etc. these days are just trying to get attention,"" and every time it sends me into another series of self-doubting thoughts.

Trying to decide that maybe I was genderfluid was tricky for me, and admittedly I mostly only decided ""yeah I'm going to try this and commit,"" when I talked with a few old friends (one cis and one genderfluid) and they were both assuring and supportive and helped me try to understand what it was I was  feeling. One of my biggest problems was worrying I was trying to enter a space I didn't really belong in just for some sort of ""special points"" or something. One told me that they didn't think I was trying to be ""super special"" while the other told me that every non-cis person they've known have had some of the thoughts and worries I was having, while none of the cis people they knew did (including themself.)

But every time I see a ""lol transtrenders!"" type post or rant, I'm right back to that place of, ""oh god I'm just trying to be extra special, I'm totally wrong about this. Im AFAB and mostly present femme/semi androgynous, I'm just lying, I'm not genderfluid, maybe cis people really do feel like this and I'm just cis trying to be extra special."" And basically I beat myself down about it, and question myself over and over again.

""I don't think I have dysphoria, so I'm clearly wrong."" Though at other times I've been trying to figure out if I *might* have dysphoria that manifests as anxiety. (hard to say because I have depression and anxiety that I never thought could be dysphoria related.) But then think, ""Well, getting insomia from anxiety because my hair feels too long isn't necessarily dysphoria"" (yes that has happened recently. I hadn't gotten my hair cut in six months and one night I realized it and was struggling with sleep for two nights after.)

""Well I don't have a problem being called 'she' and I don't hate being a woman."" Except the times where I've internally cringed at the word ""woman"" being applied to me that set off ""odd"" feelings that I can't say I could describe beyond just ""odd."" I don't know if this kind of comes with being genderfluid though, if sometimes I'm perfectly fine and can even think, ""maybe I'm just cis,"" only for x amount of time later my mind shifts on that and goes, ""NOPE not cis, I don't want to be seen as just female."" But I also don't know what that ""not female"" part is yet.

""I didn't have dysphoria or anything when I was younger, so I'm only thinking I'm this because I know a lot more. I'm just trying to be special."" Honestly, this I have no idea how to argue against or defend. When I was a young teen, I adamantly rejected overly feminine clothes like skirts, and exclusively wore pants so much so that even to nice events I wore dress pants instead of dresses. But during that time I was also dealing with a moderately abusive family life and I didn't discover a lot about myself until after I moved out and whatever ""survival mode"" my brain was in was able to shut off. (Hell I didn't realize how abusive my family life was until that point)

So overall I just feel anxious, frustrated, and stressed out again. All because of a, ""people who identify as anything other than binary trans are just making it up for attention,"" post that I happened to run across several hours ago. I wish those posts wouldn't bother me, because it's not like I'm trying to identify genderfluid for other people, or something I would really parade around to strangers beyond how I choose to present. It's not something I want strangers to outright know because, yeah, I'm afraid (yay anxiety). I'm mostly just doing it for myself, to understand myself and be comfortable with myself. So other people's opinions shouldn't bother me in theory. But nope, my brain doesn't work that way with this.
