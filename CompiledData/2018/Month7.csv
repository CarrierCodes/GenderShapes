Anyway, I have been thinking of how I identify lately and attempting to determine where I lie on the trans\* spectrum. Namely with regards to how I describe myself to others and to myself. You see I am undergoing HRT and my goal is to eventually undergo full genital reconstruction, hair removal except for head, et cetera. That is to say that I desire to, as much as is possible, transition to a place where I would be if I were AFAB as I have found that thus far the limited steps in that direction have made me feel far, far less dysphoric. While I at the same time do not intend to change my clothing style much, or become more stereotypically feminine in my interests. Basically I absolutely adore suits, hiking, and computer science.

In general I am of the opinion that the purpose of labels is to compress data and that the goal of a good label is to maximize compression while still being accurate and comprehensible to who you are talking to. So from this perspective it would indeed be accurate to describe myself as a woman assuming that definition is of the generally accepted inclusive variety and not one of the more exclusionary definitions supported by transphobes, etc. However, clearly simply having interests that may by cultural gender roles be defined as masculine does not make a person a man, just as feminine interests do not make a person a woman. While stereotypical actions may be gender affirming, I suspect it is very much a culturally related and not related to gender identity. Thus again, clearly by a modern, efficient definition of womanhood I would be a woman.

But at the same time I do not entirely feel that it is accurate to describe myself as a woman. I feel like I would be in a place where I have no particular reason to be in and would not really fit in.

I'm afab bi-gender (binary male/masc and binary female/femme with no neutral middle), and all my life I've always known I'm bi-sexual (consciously repressed and closeted), but my sexuality has always puzzled me. I'm far more attracted to men (androsexual) than women (gynosexual), in that I'm strongly attracted to the idea of sex with a woman and always have, including some childhood experimentation with a friend, but I've yet to meet a woman in person whom I actually want to be intimate with.

But I totally missed a huge piece of my sexuality by concentrating on who I am attracted *to*.

I never thought about who I am attracted *as*.

This week I finally figured it out. Whether I am on a full fem swing, or a full masc swing, I am usually a gay guy with bi-interest. Even when I'm totally a girl in every other way, sexually I am having sex from the male POV. Occasionally I take on the girl role, but generally I have to imagine I have a penis (easier after a year on T, :D ), and I desire sex with men (and women) as a man.

Before I ""came out to myself"" as non-binary transgender, it was perhaps 70F/30M (which I really didn't want to admit to myself, but knew anyway), but once I acknowledged my guy side, my interest in receiving PIV sex as a woman waned, I'm sexually more 90M/10F now.

I hadn't yet told them my pronouns and name I wanted to use, as I was closeted again. After that, I believed what they said and started presenting feminine to make them, and hopefully me, happy.

A month or two ago, I decided screw it. I got out my binder and started binding again, thinking I'd go by they pronouns after I move out. Name changing didn't cross my mind until recently. I have a very feminine name, and kind of decided to just accept it and keep it. A few weeks passed, and I got sick of it being so gendered, and started considering a genderless name change.

And then I remembered: my mom has my name tattooed on her.

If I were to change my name, I think I'd be A) Shunned by my family, B) Ignored and dead named, C) Disowned, or D) all of the above. 

So, my question is: should I keep my name, or change it?
I'm all for changing my name. I have several names picked out, but I'm not sure how I'd explain it to family. I've thought about changing my also gendered middle name and going by that, or just using a genderless nickname.
At the same time, my name has been used as far as I know by one male fictional character. This was partially why I had decided to start IDing as nb again. I could use my legal name, but I lie awake at night realizing that I'm addressed as she because of my name.

Thanks for reading my rant. Any advice is welcome.

But my presentation is not and will never be very masculine as it's not my thing.  I'm still strongly questioning who I am. I think I do experience gender dysphoria (both social and body dysphoria). I don't have diagnosis though. But I think I can deal with it without medical intervention at least for now.

Right now I'm wondering whether I'm (feminine) binary trans guy, nonbinary trans guy or even just a transvestite (with some extra issues). My main doubt about my identity revolves around dysphoria, because of 1. it doesn't seem to be as intense as the case is with some binary trans guys whose stories I've heard 2. it doesn't seem to be as coherent as the case with some binary trans guys (for example, quite weak bottom dysphoria, some secondary sex characteristics like facial hair doesn't seem necessary to me, but dysphoria around my feminine body shape and feminine face is noticeable). So I feel like I had no right to call myself binary trans guy. Especially without diagnosis and acute need for transitioning. 

So my question for nonbinary folks, how do you experience dysphoria? Have you had or do you wish to have medical transitioning? And are you binary trans only, if you wish to have ""the whole male packet""?

34,2018-07-03 23:30:25,8vwwmj,5,11,"AMAB, with gynecomastia. I sometimes feels like a boy and sometimes feels like a girl.   Like when I was a kid, I got bored and said to my mum ""mum, today I want to be a girl!"" My mum would give me some of her clothes, and then I would play like a girl.   

Later I sometimes also took my mum's clothes myself without asking her. But at puberty I found when I wore her clothes thinking I was a beautiful girl I got erections. I knew girls don't have erections and was confused and afraid. I was scared that my mum would find out. If she found out, what would she say to me?! I could not imagine. Probably she would see me as a pervert? It seemed to me that if I wanted to be a girl, I could not have my male part, and otherwise I could not be a girl. So I stopped playing the ""mum, today I want to be a girl"" game.   

I feel it's like losing some great fun, kind of a regret, but I do not have dysphoria and I'm OK with being a guy. Each time I want to play the ""mum today I want to be a girl"" game, I would go online search for sex-change information. It could be fantasy, practical information, or porn. I have learnt a lot and am still gaining more and more knowledge about sex change. Besides, I will fantasise that I have a flat crotch and a vagina, and was being taken care of, dominated, loved and penetrated by a tall and muscular guy. Or I was playing scissoring with a girl. Just by fantasising and playing with my boobs (remember, I have gynecomastia) I could achieve multiple small orgasms. Like sudden electricity flows from the tip of my penis, only lasting 1 second, but could come many times in a row. I don't even need to touch my penis. It's far less intense than a full blown male orgasm, but it still feels really good.

I used to have a room mate. I think I was in love with him and he was also in love with me. We use to do a lot things together and before we slept we used to talk with each until one of us felt into sleep. We even took showers together sometime, and he used to comment on my boobs and nipples. Like ""Wow, they are so big!"" In front of him, I think I exhibited my feminine side a lot more than usual. We kind of accepted each other the way we were. We didn't need to hide. But I couldn't physically get closer to him. I felt if I were a girl I would definitely want to have sex with him. I felt if I were to have sex with him, I was gonna offer him a vagina not a penis or anus. So we never had sex.   

Sometimes when I read success stories of post-op woman, or seeing their post-op bodies, not only the vagina folds, but also boobs, curvy hips and smooth skin, I am a bit jealous, because I couldn't have those. I am also jealous of those who have female voices. I've tried some ""voice therapy"" to sound more like a girl, so that it feels more real when I want to be a girl. My effort has not been successful. But anyway, I am happy for those transwomen, for they've got what they've been wanting so much. I think in the future if sex-change could be reversible, then I would definitely give it a try.   

For the rest of the time, I am just a guy. It's like 80&amp;#37; of the time I feel like a guy and 20&amp;#37; of the time I wish I were a girl. I had a girlfriend. When having sex, I was totally OK with being a guy. When I felt like being a girl, we would watch post-op transwoman porn and I would imagine I was the post-op transwoman. It's like they are my proxy, living a fantasy of mine. My ex-gf was fine with it and would sometimes tease me of being a girl. We broke up for other reasons.  

I think that's my story. I used to have another account with a lot of down votes from those mtf people. It turned out that those mtf people didn't think I qualified to be one of them.

Firstly: This person expressed that she was fine with all pronouns and doesn't mind gender-aligned descriptions, so me using female pronouns and calling her a ""girl"" isn't out of disrespect for her identity.

Secondly: I'm not trying to gatekeep or invalidate her. I just really need to get this off my chest.

So I'm AFAB nonbinary, have been for a long time. But I am not comfortable with being femme at all and I don't really enjoy androgyny. I'm on T and bind, planning on top surgery eventually. I don't use the term demiboy but for a quick explanation that's probably the closest estimation.

And one of my friends mentioned in facebook that she was non binary. And I don't want to sound like a gatekeeper but the way she has been handling it makes me very uncomfortable.

She explained to me that she basically doesn't believe gender exists, it's all social conditioning, and basically invoked the whole ""nothing's real and nothing matters"". She presents exclusively fem and is fine with any and all pronouns, because ""gender is a lie anyway"".

Which.....idk but I find the ""gender is fake"" stance to be really invalidating towards trans people in general, actually? Like by saying gender isn't real, you're saying that my identity isn't real and transwomen aren't women and etc. etc......it really rubs me the wrong way. My gender is an expensive exhausting pain in my ass I don't want you telling me it's not real.

Meanwhile, I had to unfollow her on facebook because multiple times a day she posts aggressive and accusatory messages about social issues that became too much for me. I have been accused by nearly everyone I know of being too much if an ""SJW"" and even I couldn't stand how viciously this person acts.

So I'm not trying to make any statements about her, not really. I'm trying to figure out something about myself. Why do I hate her so much? I think it's cause like, my dysphoria can be crippling and my dad stopped talking to me and everytime I interact with someone I'm anxious because I don't really pass as anything right now and I know they'll misgender and I'll be uncomfortable. Meanwhile, she basically just slapped the term on for the sake of perpetuating her social idea that ""gender isn't real"", and it hasn't affected her life at all.

47,2018-07-05 04:29:03,8w7olk,2,78,"So... Yeah. As the title says, I'm amab and have been going through the full transition process for almost two years now. I've been on a full dose of HRT (T-blockers + estrogen) for about a year and a half and have been loving the effects. I've got FFS scheduled to happen in about 3 months and I *just* got my bottom surgery scheduled for the very beginning of next year.

Anyways, I was going through my wardrobe tonight messing with new outfit combinations and found some of my old ""guy"" clothes that I haven't worn in a while. For whatever reason, I thought ""fuck it"" and threw on a pair of jeans, put on a sports bra to compress my (small) chest, threw on a t-shirt and then tied up my hair under a benie so that it looked short. 

When I saw myself at first there was an expected wave of dysohoria, I looked almost exactly the same as before I started transitioning (just better groomed and maybe a little prettier). Then, for the hell of it, I grabbed a jean vest that I had lying around and threw it on too. The vest was new, I never used to wear things like it before. This one was something I could never work into my more feminine styles though.

I don't know why or how, but when I saw myself with the vest on, it's like it kinda changed everything. I *really* liked how I looked (though I could feel myself terrified to admit it). Clearly boyish, but with this feminine flair or something. I don't know how to describe it, but it was *different*. I sent a picture to my friend who said I looked ""confident and hot"" and that's honestly how I felt.

I don't know. I definitely didn't feel like a guy/man and I still dont. But wearing the outfit and seeing myself, girl/woman also wasn't quite right. I didn't feel like a butch girl or anything. I know I still want bottom surgery (I hate that part of myself so much...) and I'm *pretty* sure I still want FFS too.

I'm like a dead in the middle both/neither, which meeeeeaaaaaannnnnnnnssssssss I get to deal daily with even binary trans people telling me that it's bullshit, that I don't exist, etc. etc. 

I prefer male titles (mr., sir, dad, etc.) and I'm somewhat pronoun indifferent (with a preference of he and they) and I love presenting as a mix. My ideal body is... Not very gendered. I don't want genitals (sounds weird I know, but I can't stand the idea of having either, I wish there was just nothing), and I hate having breasts and being shaped the way I am, despite being ""conventionally attractive"" in a female perspective. There are bits of me I want to transition, and bits of me I never want to change. Essentially, my experience being NB is like a shitty paint job; splotchy and inconsistent dysphoria, and I feel like everyone just wants to pretend they don't see me. 

I feel so pressured to try and conform in my day to day life. I'm ""female"" where my family and coworkers want me to be. I'm ""male"" with friends who don't get what nonbinary is, or say it's fake, because at least they can understand ""male"" and understand that I'm not female. I'm ""nonbinary,"" myself, only around 2 or 3 of my closest friends. It's been so fucking irritating. I feel like no matter where I turn I'll always just keep having to act out these roles for people. I don't get to dress how I want anymore because I'm so stressed out about binary people coming to the conclusion I'm just faking my struggles, in it for the attention, etc. I feel like shit all the time because life is just god damn exhausting. If I choose to be """"""fully trans"""""" and live as a man I'll probably be uncomfortable with what I put myself through to get there (i.e., hormone changes, I worked way too hard for my singing voice (singing helps me cope with depression) to change it and mess it up.) If I choose to live as a cis woman, I'll keep having to play out this shitty act that I'm content with what I was born into. I'll have to keep being called names I don't want, I'll have to keep being trapped in this stupid body, and I'll have to go back to being everything I forced myself to be before. 

I didn't ask for this and I hate it and it causes me so much distress on a daily basis.

Sorry for being such a downer, but I have no idea where else to turn with this. I feel like NB peoples' struggles get undermined way too much because we don't have this conventional image that people are used to like binary genders. Binary cis people are able to look at themselves and be comfortable from day 1, their gender matches what they have and they don't want it to be different. Binary trans people can look at themselves and know they want the \*other\*. But I feel like no matter what my binary options are I can't find comfort and it sucks. Some people just refuse to try and understand this, others aren't capable of understanding, and I'm so tired. 

I don't know what to do about it anymore. I don't even want to leave my house most days because it's just so mentally exhausting. Anyone have tips for coping with shit like this?

There are bits of me I want to transition, and bits of me I never want to change. Essentially, my experience being NB is like a shitty paint job; splotchy and inconsistent dysphoria, and I feel like everyone just wants to pretend they don\'t see me. \n\nI feel so pressured to try and conform in my day to day life. I\'m ""female"" where my family and coworkers want me to be. I\'m ""male"" with friends who don\'t get what nonbinary is, or say it\'s fake, because at least they can understand ""male"" and understand that I\'m not female. I\'m ""nonbinary,"" myself, only around 2 or 3 of my closest friends. It\'s been so fucking irritating. I feel like no matter where I turn I\'ll always just keep having to act out these roles for people. I don\'t get to dress how I want anymore because I\'m so stressed out about binary people coming to the conclusion I\'m just faking my struggles, in it for the attention, etc. I feel like shit all the time because life is just god damn exhausting. If I choose to be """"""fully trans"""""" and live as a man I\'ll probably be uncomfortable with what I put myself through to get there (i.e., hormone changes, I worked way too hard for my singing voice (singing helps me cope with depression) to change it and mess it up.) If I choose to live as a cis woman, I\'ll keep having to play out this shitty act that I\'m content with what I was born into. I\'ll have to keep being called names I don\'t want, I\'ll have to keep being trapped in this stupid body, and I\'ll have to go back to being everything I forced myself to be before. \n\nI didn\'t ask for this and I hate it and it causes me so much distress on a daily basis.\n\nSorry for being such a downer, but I have no idea where else to turn with this. I feel like NB peoples\' struggles get undermined way too much because we don\'t have this conventional image that people are used to like binary genders. Binary cis people are able to look at themselves and be comfortable from day 1, their gender matches what they have and they don\'t want it to be different. Binary trans people can look at themselves and know they want the \\*other\\*. But I feel like no matter what my binary options are I can\'t find comfort and it sucks. Some people just refuse to try and understand this, others aren\'t capable of understanding, and I\'m so tired. \n\nI don\'t know what to do about it anymore. I don\'t even want to leave my house most days because it\'s just so mentally exhausting. Anyone have tips for coping with shit like this?\n\nThanks for coming to my ted talk lmao', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""(Rant) I really hate being nonbinary, and I don't know what to do about it."", 'created': 1530840004.0}"

So some background, I have Autism Spectrum Disorder, when I was diagnosed they said it was Aspergers but apparently the term changed...? Anyway, I relate to my body in a weird way.

(Note: this is a personal experience I'm trying to wrestle with, so please don't feel obligated to read and please, please don't be discouraged either...I'm just in a weird situation lol this is not the norm for these things)

I had my consultation with the plastic surgeon yesterday and it was a mix of feeling really prepared and really unprepared.

I was prepared to give myself over an hour to find the office which was 25 minutes away, but was not prepared to actually need that whole hour due to getting lost...showing up 3 minutes before my appointment was stressful as I've never been late to a medical appointment in my life and started panicking that I would miss this one as God's punishment or something lol... (sigh)

But I made it, and was brought to a room where I was told to take off my top and bra (didn't bother with a binder since it takes me thirty years to remove it), which I had been preparing myself for all week. It's top surgery...someone had to look at my chest at some point.

I was not, however, prepared to be informed that there was a resident shadowing my surgeon, so that would be two men looking at my chest and touching me, but I kept reminding myself that viewing my body from a clinical perspective was waaay different than from a sexual one.

I was prepared to discuss my history and why I wanted top surgery...I was not prepared to be told that as soon as we were done chatting, they'd run the insurance request and schedule a second appointment for right before the surgery. I was referred here by my primary care, but I guess....I don't know, I thought I'd have to fight for it or something, but the general vibe I got was, ""This is happening."".

I was not prepared to be measured. 

I was NOT prepared to be measured.

I kind of just turned my head to the wall and tuned everything out, waiting for it to be over. ((Both men were extremely professional and polite---the surgeon would not even move the folds of my gown away but waited for me to do it ----but regardless....I was not prepared to be measured)

They took pictures  (sans face), but only after asking if it was okay....I had signed the consent form to take photos and agreed again when they verbally asked but.....I don't know. Our generation has spent way too much time hearing about tech breaches, and having very specific tattoos didn't help me feel confident about my ongoing anonymity.......although, I don't think I could ever be prepared to have pictures taken of my body like that, even though obviously nothing bad had happened.

I cannot emphasize enough how incredibly wonderful my surgeon was....he was so polite, professional, friendly and easy to talk to, appropriate, everything you could ask for in a stranger that got to walk in and see what nobody except your spouse would ever see.

But then we started talking about the procedure  (the nurse assured me he would go over all the details and answer every single question I had), and I off-handedly laughed when he asked if keeping sensation was important to me, to which I replyed that I'd be fine if he left me with nothing but two scars on my chest. 

He laughed with me and dismissed it at first, but caught something in my response. He gently explained to me that a 100% flat chest is a mastectomy but a male chest is different  (something about the remaining tissue curving a bit to give the definition of muscles or something like that).....and he started asking me quietly (and very gently still), ""Do you want a flat chest or a male chest?""

And he repeated it in the silence as I mentally fought with myself, terrified that if I answered honestly I'd be denied and have my 38D monstrosity forever, and I couldn't risk messing this up when I was so close...

But I stubbornly repeated that I wanted a flat chest because it was the truth and realizing I didn't even want a male chest left me reeling and confused, which I think he picked up on but didn't say anything disparaging.....and he said I was more than welcome to try and push through for the insurance, but I might have a better case if I had gone through a breast surgeon and requested a cautionary mastectomy due to my medical chart being flagged at a high risk for cancer...

He assured me that if I did end up going through his office (with or without insurance), he'd be happy to give me the flat chest I wanted, but warned me it was unlikely insurance would cover since I hadn't socially transitioned yet.......but I explained to him that I can't ever fully socially transition without losing far too much, that hormone treatment was highly unlikely, if ever.....and he concluded that perhaps special circumstances could apply, but that it was up in the air.

I left and was prepared to get lost on the drive home (which I did), but wasn't prepared for the jumble of echoing emotions that were ghosting around me. I was stressed but not overtly so, angry but not feeling vindictive, exposed but not taken advantage of, and just a general sense of being overwhelmed even though I wasn't completely sure why. I felt fine and terrible simultaneously.

All in all, from getting in the car that morning to getting home took a total of four hours, and I more or less haven't stopped shoveling junk food into my mouth since, restlessly moving from one purchase to the next and hoping I can stay distracted. 


I know I need to sit down and talk this through with myself, figure out what's up.....not being able to freely discuss it with anyone around me has left me frustrated as well.......but my spouse does not support me at all and overtly mocks the whole demographic, so I've just been inwardly feing very overwhelmed and confused, wondering if I've been mistaken about things, or if there's any other factor(s) of which I'm not yet aware......but I guess that's a post for another time. 



TL;DR: Do I even want to be a guy? Is my dysphoria linked to gender issues or something else? Stay tuned and maybe we'll both get to find out lol

Now I'm the one asking myself questions. I'm an AFAB person who thought of herself as cis up to this point. I kind of had forgotten that I did heavily question my gender for a long time a few years ago - before I knew gender wasn't a binary. I think part of me wanted to be a trans man just so I could know what was up, but I never ever felt like a man. Back then I ended up thinking that not feeling like a man at all qualified me as a woman, enven though now I can't remember if I ever fully felt like one.

Then I sort of brushed it all under the rug, replaced gender angst with a lot of feminist activism, gender studies and the likes... I somehow even forgot how much I had questioned my gender. In the mean time, I was the one who told my trans woman best friend and my non-binary partner that they were, well, trans. So when I started wondering about myself all I could think was ""how could I just find out about myself NOW, after I've helped two people with that?"" It doesn't really make sense but having taken years to come out as bisexual and watching the youtube channel Contrapoints I now think you can be ""woke"" about something and still be in deep denial about yourself.

Anyway. I'm happy when people get confused about my gender, I'm very uncomfortable with performing feminity (I feel better looking androgynous though I enjoy the occasional sun dress), I honestly wonder if cis people even question their gender... On the other hand I have no body dysphoria and no problem with female pronouns.

More than anything I'm afraid that I've convinced myself I was a woman so deeply that I won't ever know if I really an one? And that I've mixed up the ""gender as an innate sense of identity"" and ""gender as a social construct"" (to me both exist but are very different things, aka gender itself and society-prescribed gender roles) schools of thought too much to be able to know where I'm at.

I saw one way to describe NB is ""some people don't neatly fit into the categories of man or woman, or male or female.‚Äù But I don't understand this.

101,2018-07-09 10:06:47,8xa7p2,4,21,"And that really fuckin sucks too, like when strangers suck its a small hit, it hurts for a moment, but hey theyre just a stranger with a stupid face and a stupid mouth which they use to spew stupid shit, so you can move forward, sure you might think about it again at some point, but it doesnt matter, theyre just a stupid stranger.

But when someone close to you sucks, youre fucked because when you see them and think about them, you think about the stupid shit they said, and theyre not a stupid stranger, you care about them and their opinions, their stupid fuckin opinions. 

And with some people you know right out they dont support you and that sucks, but yoi know what sucks more? Those people who make you think they support you but they dont. Like for instance my one friend who i first vented to after buying my first binder and how my dysphoria was like fuckin killing me and shit and i fuckin opened up and shit and i croed for like an hour on the phone to her because i just had so much hate for myself and my body and other shit. And i thought she supported me, but i should of fucking knew, the entire time she did ask me questions like ""are you absolutely sure, you might just like the size"" ""wait so you dont wanna be a girl or boy, are yoi sure yoi dont just wanna have smaller boobs?"" ""you really shouldnt spend so much money on a whim"" ""well i guess if youre really committed..."" 

And when i told another friend, whos fucking great by the way hes the fuckin best, my prefered name she got real pissy and shit and at firsr refused to call me it, and really she doesnt, the only time i am is on her fuckin onsta page or some fuckom shit, and i fuckong should of know or when she saod all those timss ""youre not trans"", ""youre not really nonbinary"" but all those times i excuses her, it was okay because she still ""supported me in spirt"" and all that jazz 

But then we had a 'conversation' which was less of me talking and more of ""her telling me what i really feel"" because apparently ""im just a confused girl who wants a flat chest, and the only reason why is because of the assults, its so sad i was assulted, and of course shes here for me now, but if i had never been assulted i wouldnt 'have dysphoria'and id be a perfectly fine girl"" and i just feel like the worlds biggest fuckin idiot that id believe for even a moment she supported me, for a moment i excused saying shed come around to certain aspects and she did support me. 

For a small moment i thought i had things sorted out with my mom, who was extremely upset when ever i tried to convey to her i didnt want afab. Then we finally sat down and actually talked and i explained i wanted to be neither male or female and she said that she waa okay with that, that she'd still love and accept me. 

I sincerely wish she had stopped talking there. She went on to state she was worried id want to get ""the surgery"" on day and how, even though she's ""super progressive and amazing"" and she believes trans people can desire to be the opposite gender, **but** changing your sex is to far, why cant they **keep pretending** to be the opposite gender? (also mom i might not get bottom surgery but I AM getting top surgery on day so youre not out of the field just cause i dont want a dick)I fought the urge to go into full blown argument by reminding myself of the fact she had at least said she was fine with me being nonbinary. 

I sincerely wish i didnt ""push it"" with ""my silly questions"" so i asked if shed use my pronouns, but nah shes already got it in grained to her brain and 'it would just feel weird to refer to you as they'. So i then informed her, not asked, that some of my friends already used they pronouns towards me, 'okay, as long as they dont use it around me, i would feel akward', hey since you accept me can i start binding again with out you yelling at me? ""you know how i feel about that, i just said i accepted you, dont push it"", welp how about hair i really wanna fuckim do something about fuckin dysphoria and shits, ""i have told you time and time again, my dad liked girls with long hair so when i was young it was ingrained to me that girls must have long hair"" BUT I JUST SAID I AM NOT A GIRL AND YOU SAID YOU ACCEPTED THAT. 

but apparently im a bully, im just trying to bully her into giving me what i want. By being depressed im bullying her, by mot leaving my room for days im bullying her, by having dysphoria im bullying her, by cutting myself im bullying her, by asking to see a therapist im bullying her, by trying to kill myself im bullying her, god im such a big bully, i dont do these things because i hate myself and hate livjng and because every day is a fucking chore and sometimes i just cant take it and i hate my bosy amd alllll that fun shit, no, no, no, i do these things to bully her, im such a big bully.

""you really shouldnt spend so much money on a whim"" ""well i guess if youre really committed..."" \n\nAnd when i told another friend, whos fucking great by the way hes the fuckin best, my prefered name she got real pissy and shit and at firsr refused to call me it, and really she doesnt, the only time i am is on her fuckin onsta page or some fuckom shit, and i fuckong should of know or when she saod all those timss ""youre not trans"", ""youre not really nonbinary"" but all those times i excuses her, it was okay because she still ""supported me in spirt"" and all that jazz \n\nBut then we had a \'conversation\' which was less of me talking and more of ""her telling me what i really feel"" because apparently ""im just a confused girl who wants a flat chest, and the only reason why is because of the assults, its so sad i was assulted, and of course shes here for me now, but if i had never been assulted i wouldnt \'have dysphoria\'and id be a perfectly fine girl"" and i just feel like the worlds biggest fuckin idiot that id believe for even a moment she supported me, for a moment i excused saying shed come around to certain aspects and she did support me. \n\nFor a small moment i thought i had things sorted out with my mom, who was extremely upset when ever i tried to convey to her i didnt want afab. Then we finally sat down and actually talked and i explained i wanted to be neither male or female and she said that she waa okay with that, that she\'d still love and accept me. \n\nI sincerely wish she had stopped talking there. She went on to state she was worried id want to get ""the surgery"" on day and how, even though she\'s ""super progressive and amazing"" and she believes trans people can desire to be the opposite gender, **but** changing your sex is to far, why cant they **keep pretending** to be the opposite gender? (also mom i might not get bottom surgery but I AM getting top surgery on day so youre not out of the field just cause i dont want a dick)I fought the urge to go into full blown argument by reminding myself of the fact she had at least said she was fine with me being nonbinary. \n\nI sincerely wish i didnt ""push it"" with ""my silly questions"" so i asked if shed use my pronouns, but nah shes already got it in grained to her brain and \'it would just feel weird to refer to you as they\'. So i then informed her, not asked, that some of my friends already used they pronouns towards me, \'okay, as long as they dont use it around me, i would feel akward\', hey since you accept me can i start binding again with out you yelling at me? ""you know how i feel about that, i just said i accepted you, dont push it"", welp how about hair i really wanna fuckim do something about fuckin dysphoria and shits, ""i have told you time and time again, my dad liked girls with long hair so when i was young it was ingrained to me that girls must have long hair"" BUT I JUST SAID I AM NOT A GIRL AND YOU SAID YOU ACCEPTED THAT. \n\nbut apparently im a bully, im just trying to bully her into giving me what i want. By being depressed im bullying her, by mot leaving my room for days im bullying her, by having dysphoria im bullying her, by cutting myself im bullying her, by asking to see a therapist im bullying her, by trying to kill myself im bullying her, god im such a big bully, i dont do these things because i hate myself and hate livjng and because every day is a fucking chore and sometimes i just cant take it and i hate my bosy amd alllll that fun shit, no, no, no, i do these things to bully her, im such a big bully.

To cut to the chase, I'm an AFAB genderqueer person, and I've recently been heavily considering looking into taking low doses of T to try to feel more at home in my body. I prefer having a more androgynous look, but my face is so round and soft, as well as my body, that I have a very hard time achieving that through clothing and hair. I also go through periods of time where I just *feel* masc, I don't know how to explain it. However, I don't consider myself to be a trans person - just a genderless person who has a lot of traditionally feminine body traits (sans a big chest). My sex drive is even non-existent, which while I *do* identify as asexual, I can't help but wonder if it has to do with hormones and dysphoria.


I've been feeling very conflicted about attempting hormone therapy, however. It's not so much introspection on how I personally feel about it as it is ideological self-doubt. Things like, ""There are so many transgender people who desperately want to be on hormone treatment and aren't able to, why should I take it when my dysphoria isn't *that* bad?"" ""Do I really feel this way about myself, or am I trying to be ""T  R  E  N  D  Y?"""" 


I know some of this doubt is rooted in discussions in the LGBTQ community from less inclusive members, and some is internalized from my mother, who keeps insisting that she ""had a beautiful daughter and she doesn't make mistakes.""


How do you all personally feel about hormone therapy without transitioning? And do any of you fine folks who have or are undergoing it have any advice for me? Are the conflicts I'm having toxic or a reasonable set of questions to ask myself?

I'm a cis gender person who hasn't really had to think about their gender too much because of that fact. But when it comes to gender as a whole and how gender works in society, it can be a little confusing to me sometimes.

143,2018-07-13 04:47:15,8yh1i3,4,23,"Dear /r/NonBinary,

I am a 35 year old AMAB enby.  Earlier this year, I came out to my life partner who is my wife and the mother of my daughter.

I told you about how hard it was for her to accept.  Some of you suggested to me that my wife is a bigot and I might be best off separated from her.  I believe and have faith that she loves me, but she's used to thinking of me as a man that I presented myself as, not some odd trans-non-binary something or another.  It is truly unfair to her that she married me presenting as what I thought I needed to present as instead of how I feel inside.  As a matter of fact, I denied to myself who and what I am.

I do not believe that my wife is a bigot.  I believe that she feels a bit cheated that she didn't get what she thought she was getting.  Time has healed some of the shock from the coming out, but there is more work to do.  She has reassured me that she loves me.  After all, regardless of whatever else I am, I am her loyal husband and the devoted father of our daughter.  She admires me for filling these roles even if my gender identity makes her uncomfortable.

My father, on the other hand, is a bigot.  I don't believe I will ever choose to be ""out"" to him in any sense of the word.  It is quite possible that I will eventually be outed to him, and that is something I dread.  On the other hand, keeping my gender identity a secret from him seems like a heavy burden to bear.  My father is a man who openly hates LGBT people, and the idea that I could be one disgusts him.  I honestly believe that if were to explain to him that I am trans-non-binary, he would likely insinuate that I chose to become something totally disgusting because I hate him and want to hurt him.  His head would explode. (and it would be my fault, at least in his mind)

As for my wife, in spite of her assurances that she loves me, which I do take at face value, it is clear to me that there is a long road ahead.

I love my wife very much.  She is a very devoted wife and she doesn't deserve to have to undertake a difficult personal journey to learn to love her husband as he truly is as opposed to as she wishes he were.  I want to make her happy, but I see her longing for me to be something that I am not, and honestly, it breaks my heart because I believe she deserves to be happy.  We deserve to be happy together.  We've never done anything wrong to hurt anyone.  We just want to enjoy our life together and raise our little daughter to grow into a wonderful person.

I hate to admit it, but it's still difficult for me to love this non-binary part of myself.  As I said in the past, I was taught growing up that transgender people are so disgusting as to be practically beyond words to properly describe how disgusting they are.  I know it's a cliche, but my heart is full of love and I feel disgusted that I had this bigotry drilled into my head.

But back to my wife... she's been saying things lately... It's almost like a passive-aggressive resistance to my gender identity, and it betrays her anxious longing for me to go back into the closet and stay there forever!  Friends, I can't do that.  I don't want to martyr myself for her sake.

The only way that I've seriously thought about permanently modifying my body is I've thought about having my facial hair removed.  I haven't grown a beard in years.  I visited a few places that provide that service and did research about it, and I eventually told my wife, and she wistfully said, ""Oh, but I like your facial hair"", referring to the stubble that I've come to see like a blemish on my skin as a result of gender dysphoria.  I've mentioned it numerous times, and the response is always the same.  It's like I'm threatening to take a favorite toy away from a child.  How could I do that?

I've been growing my hair out a bit.  It's still only several inches long.  For those of you who don't know, the average person's hair grows at a rate of about six inches per year, so if I want a head of hair reaching down to my shoulders, that will take \*years\*.  And yet, it's only been several months since I stopped regularly cutting it short, and she's already making remarks about how ""handsome"" I look with short hair.  Just a few hours ago, she pointed to a picture on the wall taken on our wedding day, telling me how handsome I am with short hair.  Friends, she wants to be married to a man, not an enby.

That doesn't even begin to cover how she feels about my mannerisms.

Honestly, if my wife were to decide that she doesn't like me the way I am, there are very few people out there who seem to like me as I am.  I am an introvert, not a socialite, and most of my friends are ""pen friends"" and ""internet friends"".

I believe then, that the two of us are at a point where she needs to understand that I am an enby and that I never will be (and never truly was) the man she wants me to be.  It is unfair to her that I presented myself to her as something I'm not, and it is unfair to me that I'm facing pressure to be something that I'm not.

I just don't know how to talk to her about it.

The only thing I know to do is to have a very frank talk about it.  Tell her ""This is what I am and I am powerless to change that."" and ""I love you, but you are pressuring me to something that I'm not and it's hurting me, so I need you to stop."" and perhaps, ""Darling, this is what I am and I know it's not what you want, so can you help me understand how I can make it easier for you because you deserve to be happy.""

Hey there. Ah this post is so hard to write. I already tried and deleted it. Anyway. 

I‚Äôm AFAB. (I almost just deleted this post again because this is hard to say and I‚Äôm not sure what to say and ahhh) However I feel like I‚Äôm nothing I guess? I‚Äôm uncomfortable with the assumptions brought along with gender. I feel best being referred to as they/them, and my chosen name (though I haven‚Äôt been able to ask anybody to do this yet). 
I don‚Äôt know if this general sense of unease is dysphoria, and I have this weird bottom dysphoria that comes out when I think about intercourse with women (I‚Äôm bisexual) in which I wish I had male genitalia/ male genitalia feels right at the time. I have no desire or feelings regarding my genitals otherwise. I wish my chest was flat, but I think this is maybe just a preference thing to do with my general unhappiness with my body. 

Spiritually, I feel like people are just people. While I understand that physical sex exists, I don‚Äôt think this should be of note or affect one‚Äôs view of the individual. I guess I see the soul and not the physical form, so gender expression is more just personal expression in my eyes. People should just be accepted for who they are at the base level, without uncontrollable factors being taken into account. However I‚Äôll always respect other‚Äôs pronouns, and understand the importance of using proper pronouns in regards to one‚Äôs well being. I take the way someone identifies as the truth. 

A lot of my hobbies are softer and ‚Äúgirly‚Äù, so that‚Äôs why I guess I ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù myself the most. However, logically I find this ridiculous because interests are genderless and perceived gendering is a condition of society. I also seem to put more weight on my traditionally feminine hobbies when questioning my gender, where as I‚Äôm quick to push aside my traditionally masculine hobbies as not meaningful enough in this context. Again, illogical. 

I just feel like a being of nothingness. Just a being that doesn‚Äôt desire or align with the visual, physical world. However I don‚Äôt really present androgynously, because I don‚Äôt put weight into physical appearance determining gender and many of my interests fall into the cutesy/ pastel category. I would find it fine and not at all ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù of a man to participate in cutesy or pastel things, so I‚Äôm not sure why I feel so negatively towards myself about this stuff.

I guess I‚Äôll end this here because I‚Äôm genuinely just rambling.

tl;dr : 
Gender identity primarily feels spiritual with minimal genital dysphoria, ‚Äúgirly‚Äù interests make me doubt myself despite my ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù hobbies, gender neutral pronouns/chosen name make me feel best. I don‚Äôt feel ‚Äúnonbinary‚Äù enough I guess, or I feel as though it‚Äôs coming from an odd place.

149,2018-07-14 01:49:56,8yprgi,0,1,"I've been trying to understand gender and gender identity and how it relates to myself, but I'm struggling to figure things out, getting stressed and giving myself a headache. If I google definitions of 'gender identity', here are some of the things I get:

&gt; One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither ‚Äì   
&gt;  
&gt;\-  
&gt;  
&gt; Identity: our deeply held, internal sense of self as male, female, a blend of both, or neither; who we internally know ourselves to be.   
&gt;  
&gt;\-  
&gt;  
&gt; Gender identity is defined as a personal conception of oneself as male or female (or rarely, both or neither). This concept is intimately related to the concept of gender role, which is defined as the outward manifestations of personality that reflect the gender identity. 

The issue I'm having is that with the ""personal conception of oneself as \[gender\]"", ""deeply held internal sense of self as \[gender\]"", ""innermost concept of self as \[gender\], I feel personally like I have no clue what that means or what they're talking about. If I say ""I'm male"", that feels like a statement of physical observation about by body. Like ""I'm 6'4"""", or ""I have blue eyes"". I'm really struggling to see how my male-ness is any more a part of my identity or sense of self than any other physical trait, I don't ""identify"" as a blue eyed person, or identify as a tall person, those are just physical observations, similarly ""identifying"" as a male just seems weird to me.

What I've read then gets into masculine vs. feminine behaviors or likes, but those just feel like boxes or stereotypes? I like 'feminine' things and 'masculine' things, I like doing both stereotypically 'masculine' and 'feminine' things, but as I said those just seem like pointless boxes. I've been told I 'socialize like a girl' and I have no clue what that means, but pretty much everyone sees me as male since I'm a tall viking looking person. I don't mind male pronouns, but people trying to apply hyper-masculine traits to me, or trying to shame me for doing 'feminine' things bothers the fuck out of me. My friends all use ""they"" to refer to me, so that's just what I'm used to in general, idk if I'm *more* comfortable with it. I'm physically female in a good portion of my dreams, sometimes feel weird about my male-bodied-ness, but the dreams have never seriously bothered me and the latter is pretty mild anymore. 

Am I just overthinking things? Like gender makes sense in my mind for other people. It makes sense in my mind for my trans friends, when I think about them it feels just obvious that they're the gender that they are and I've never struggled with that.

This concept is intimately related to the concept of gender role, which is defined as the outward manifestations of personality that reflect the gender identity. \n\nThe issue I\'m having is that with the ""personal conception of oneself as \\[gender\\]"", ""deeply held internal sense of self as \\[gender\\]"", ""innermost concept of self as \\[gender\\], I feel personally like I have no clue what that means or what they\'re talking about. If I say ""I\'m male"", that feels like a statement of physical observation about by body. Like ""I\'m 6\'4"""", or ""I have blue eyes"". I\'m really struggling to see how my male-ness is any more a part of my identity or sense of self than any other physical trait, I don\'t ""identify"" as a blue eyed person, or identify as a tall person, those are just physical observations, similarly ""identifying"" as a male just seems weird to me.\n\nWhat I\'ve read then gets into masculine vs. feminine behaviors or likes, but those just feel like boxes or stereotypes? I like \'feminine\' things and \'masculine\' things, I like doing both stereotypically \'masculine\' and \'feminine\' things, but as I said those just seem like pointless boxes. I\'ve been told I \'socialize like a girl\' and I have no clue what that means, but pretty much everyone sees me as male since I\'m a tall viking looking person. I don\'t mind male pronouns, but people trying to apply hyper-masculine traits to me, or trying to shame me for doing \'feminine\' things bothers the fuck out of me. My friends all use ""they"" to refer to me, so that\'s just what I\'m used to in general, idk if I\'m *more* comfortable with it. I\'m physically female in a good portion of my dreams, sometimes feel weird about my male-bodied-ness, but the dreams have never seriously bothered me and the latter is pretty mild anymore. \n\nAm I just overthinking things? Like gender makes sense in my mind for other people. It makes sense in my mind for my trans friends, when I think about them it feels just obvious that they\'re the gender that they are and I\'ve never struggled with that.

153,2018-07-14 04:53:46,8yqujg,25,18,"Hi! I couldn't find an answer in the archives, so hoping I can find a few answers here.

I am a hetero, cis-woman that supports, but is not very familiar with individuals that identify as non-binary.

I'm creating a platonic friendship app and want to include settings that allow people to set preferences on who shows up in their feed based on their gender identity.

I.e. someone can select ""I am a woman"" and the option for ""I'd like to meet - Only Women"" would become available.

I am going to include non-binary as an option because I don;t want sign up to be a frustrating experience.

My questions are:

1. For ""I am a"" - should the option read ""non-binary individual"" or is there better, preferred phrasing I can use?
2. Would adding the option for ""I'd like to meet only NB individuals"" if someone selects ""I am a NB Individual"" be a setting people are looking for? 
3. Am I missing anything key? I want to create an experience that's welcoming and not restrictive for anybody, so if I'm making any mistakes, please let me know!

For the past few days I've followed the same pattern--I just wake up in the morning and look down at my body and go, okay. Maybe these genitals and sex characteristics don't actually have a huge bearing on my gender identity like I thought they did. It's just what I have--but it and I are in this together. Let's get up and go through the day.

And it's so... it's like what I imagine dissociation to be, but not, because I'm fully there. It's like those times when you realize that your mind is in your brain which is using your body as a shell and you just go... woahh... the part of me that actually has an 'I' is so much smaller than the thing I refer to as ""I"".

I feel kinda like I wanna name my body, like you would affectionately nickname a car Ol' Bessie or something. It gets me where I need to go and it can't help being what it is.

It's this weird acceptance thing. And I keep wondering if now that I'm acknowledging that I am NB, have I opened a floodgate of some kind, and is body dysphoria suddenly going to kick in? Or more accurately, am I going to suddenly realize that I had body dysphoria all along? It's like what the what.

But anyway. Right now is okay. Right now, it feels like this weird amount of self-acceptance that I've never had before. Over the past five years I've been building up my self-acceptance in many different ways -- spiritual, emotional, mental--but physical has always lagged behind--resignation rather than contentment.

Often times it's just me daydreaming about what my life would be like if I was born a girl or getting depressed wondering why I can't relate to any of the men I know. Also I sometimes was curious about playing with dolls or crossdressing. I thought it was natural, but I don't know.

And are non-binary and trans people the only ones that question their gender? No one can always have the dial turned to 100% male all of the time can they?
 Well it's happening again. I'm wondering if am a man and am feeling the urge to wear make up and crossdress yet again. And it's feeling more intense that ever has been before. Just yesterday I was in a thrift store shopping through the woman's section and I didn't care if anyone was noticing. I am actually quite comfortable shopping in make up stores, but I would never let anyone see me wear a dress. However I have no problems with my pronouns and my appearance. I like presenting myself as a man and like being perseved as a man. So I must be a cis male right? Although I'm far from the alpha males and dude bros. 
As for pronouns it's kind of weird actually. My mother has Alzheimer's and has used she/her when referring to which make me feel very uncomfortable, but I'm not sure if that was because the gendering or seeing the effects of the Alzheimer's. Also my dad once told me that I would make a good ""spouse"" for some one which did give me a shock of joy. Like he could have just said husband, but the fact that he didn't gender me was very cool. Certain terms do discourage me like sir, gentleman, and all of that formal stuff.  
Since I've been questioning I've been wondering what's triggering it. And well I've been reading up on non-binary people and watching a lot of vlogs. So am I over sympathizing? Or am I imprinting myself onto non-binary people? It's not uncommon of me to do that. I sometimes see traits in people that are actually not there. These are traits that I unconsciously want to see in them. I also get caught up being interested in something only to realize a month later that I actually don't like it. For example when I thought that I was really into ASMR. So I have to ask myself am I non-binary? 
I sometimes feel more comfortable around women and find things labeled feminine entertaining. Also I'm always intrigued by media created by trans people. 
I guess I'm not a 100% male. Maybe I'm a demiboy, but I not familiar with the term and I often see it associated with the term softboy and I'm anything but soft. I don't want to change my perspective on myself, I would rather have society change their perspective on what it means to be a man.

Hello all! I'm FtX, 22, NY based. 

I realized I wasn't cis a few years back. At that time, I thought I was gender fluid, and wanted to start T more than anything. Experienced dysphoria almost daily. Now I consider myself just genderless/something else, but I still think I want to start T. The problem is that before, I was with a partner who wouldn't have accepted it. Due to that, I just learned to ignore how I felt and buried it. A few years later, my now fiancee and I have talked it over and we agree that if I start it will be a process to get used to, but it's something we will work on together and he won't leave me because of it. He supports me 100%. 

Now, I'm just sort of feeling lost, because for the longest time I felt stuck with the way I am now. I'm very feminine looking, and I feared that my partners would leave if I looked more masculine. But now that it's a complete possiblity that I could start, I don't know what to really make of it.

What if I regret it? What if my fiancee starts to not be attracted to me because I look more masculine? 

With that being said, I am actually relatively comfortable with how I look. I want to lose some weight however, and I have heavy bouts of jealousy(?), envy(?) when I see other ""masculine"" looking people, ESPECIALLY andro people. I also feel that this apathy is just a result of my foolishness in putting someone elses desires before my own. Even if my fiancee isn't attracted to me if I start T, I could still make it on my own. He's been the only constant in my life, however, and losing his security would be devastating for a while. But I could make it. I love myself enough to do what I need to do to be happy, but I'm just worried about the potential fallout of starting To and finding out it isn't for me after all.

I dunno. I just feel sort of stuck. Thanks for reading this far is you have.

I like my birth name just fine, it's unique and doesn't cause me dysphoria, but I do dislike that it causes people to read me as (more) feminine. I usually go by my birth name in professional settings (which is fine for now, but if I end up finding a new job in a year or so I'm going to go by a chosen name instead). 

Socially and on social media I've been introducing myself as ""Cas"". It's a shortened version of my birth name and I like that it's gender-neutral. HOWEVER people have a really hard time with it for some reason. They can't figure out if I'm saying ""Cat"" or ""Gas"" or whatever and they always spell it with two S unless I correct them. 

My initials are CJ. I've been thinking about trying that as a name and might be able to ask a few close friends to do it. 

My question is...

If you were to hear the name ""Cas"" and the name ""CJ"", what gender would you assume someone is based on those names? Which do you think is easier to say/remember? 

Also, any tips on getting people to use a chosen name when they know your birth name/have known you for a long time/called you by a nickname for a while?

My smile's bright when I come out tonight

I am more than just my genes

An amazing evolution,

I don't care if some are mean!

There's a cool enby deep inside,

Couldn't keep it in, glad I didn't try (alternative, if you did suppress your identity: Heaven knows I've tried)

Don't let them in, don't let them see

Be the good girl you always have to be

Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know

I'm NB

Can't hold it in anymore

I'm NB

I'm NB

The world is an open door

I'm stronger than what they can say

I know I'm not wrong‚Äî

""They/them"" always suited me anyway!

Feels like my soul just got a rinse

I then ripped down a wall

And the fear (alt: and the girl) that once controlled me

Isn't in here at all!

/

It's time to see what I will do

Test the limits and break through!

No ""girl,"" no ""she,"" no dress for me!

I'm free!

/

I'm NB, I'm NB

To that scared girl, I say goodbye.

I'm NB, I'm NB

You'll sometimes see me cry,

Yet here I stand

And here I'll stay!

I know I'm not wrong‚Äî

""They/them"" always suited me anyway!

This here is my identity that I have found

My soul is now growing into myself all around!

I can completely understand myself, at last!

I'm never going back, the past is in the past!

I'm NB, I'm NB

And I'll rise like the break of dawn

I'm NB, I'm NB

Here I stand with ""her"" thrown away

200,2018-07-17 18:01:54,8zngf2,13,24,"Do you wish it would just stop so you have only one gender and settle comfortably into a single identity?

I am AFAB, 49, bi-gender, and fully aware of it for only the last 19 months. However, according to everyone around me, my gender fluctuations (between binary masc and binary femme, nearly no middle ground, and the brief periods of time I am both I am at my most dysphoric) have been happening and obvious to anyone who knows me at all at least since I was a teenager in the 1980s. When I came out to two people I hadn't seen since about 1989, the response was ""yep, that makes sense."" My adult kids also said, ""Yeah, mom, we've always known you were more than *just* female.""

It was actually easier before I knew/understood what/who I am. I had mild dysphoria when I was on a guy swing, which has mostly disappeared since I now acknowledge my guy side, chosen a name, and present as male part time while on guy swings. But I was always very happy and comfortable on girl swings, though they weren't as *complete* as they are now.

There are times when I love being bi-gender, and I kind-of feel sorry for cisgender people who have never had the experience of *being* the other gender. I love *being* a guy, in a completely different way than the way I love being a girl. When I'm fully guy I'm totally relaxed, chill, comfortable, but at the same time thrilled and excited to be there. When I'm fully girl I feel powerful, intense, happy/bubbly and happy to be me.

However, now that I'm completely conscious of what's happening, I just want it to stop. I would prefer to be fully cis female. As a girl I'm totally femme, I feel like a cis girl, I am disinterested anything associated with guys, I don't even like unisex shirts. I won't ride a men's bike! I begin to doubt I have a masc side, and that it's all in my head. However, the next best thing would to be fully binary masc - just be completely FTM, and make a full transition to be happy. When I'm on a guy swing I start to doubt my femme identity, and I really feel fully male/transguy.

But I have to moderate the changes I allow myself. I have to maintain enough guy when I'm on a girl swing, so that when I swing back I don't get an attack of dysphoria, and the reverse, as a guy I have to maintain something of being a girl so that I don't freak out when I swing back to girl.

However, according to everyone around me, my gender fluctuations (between binary masc and binary femme, nearly no middle ground, and the brief periods of time I am both I am at my most dysphoric) have been happening and obvious to anyone who knows me at all at least since I was a teenager in the 1980s. When I came out to two people I hadn\'t seen since about 1989, the response was ""yep, that makes sense."" My adult kids also said, ""Yeah, mom, we\'ve always known you were more than *just* female.""\n\nIt was actually easier before I knew/understood what/who I am. I had mild dysphoria when I was on a guy swing, which has mostly disappeared since I now acknowledge my guy side, chosen a name, and present as male part time while on guy swings. But I was always very happy and comfortable on girl swings, though they weren\'t as *complete* as they are now.\n\nThere are times when I love being bi-gender, and I kind-of feel sorry for cisgender people who have never had the experience of *being* the other gender. I love *being* a guy, in a completely different way than the way I love being a girl. When I\'m fully guy I\'m totally relaxed, chill, comfortable, but at the same time thrilled and excited to be there. When I\'m fully girl I feel powerful, intense, happy/bubbly and happy to be me.\n\nHowever, now that I\'m completely conscious of what\'s happening, I just want it to stop. I would prefer to be fully cis female. As a girl I\'m totally femme, I feel like a cis girl, I am disinterested anything associated with guys, I don\'t even like unisex shirts. I won\'t ride a men\'s bike! I begin to doubt I have a masc side, and that it\'s all in my head. However, the next best thing would to be fully binary masc - just be completely FTM, and make a full transition to be happy.

Hormone situation is odd. T is a quarter of the low range for my age group, and E is more than double high end (but low SHBG means bioavailable T is around normal). So basically I have T deficiency and extra E. I know that improper hormones can cause dysphoria in people who are trans or non-binary (e.g. T for some trans women).

I couldn't have asked for a better result, honestly. He's terrified this means I won't want to be with him, which is NOT the case. It's a gender identity thing, not a sexual orientation thing.

He's like a 0 on the Kinsey scale, so it'd be hard for him to maintain attraction to me if I looked too masc. Which I fully understand. I wouldn't force him to stay with me.

So, here's the sitch: my spouse (S) has terrible dysphoria around their chest. S has been wearing a binder for a couple of years now, and has wanted top surgery for even longer. The physical repercussions of wearing a binder, as well as the fact that their chest is very large (to the point where even if there wasn't chest-related dysphoria, S would probably need a reduction) are really taking a toll.

When I was younger, even though my mum cut my hair into a bob every time, I got taken for a boy by countless strangers. And it didn't perturb me - I actually enjoyed that fact. One of my early memories is of when my mum put my hair in plaits when it was wet (I think I was reluctant) so it would go wavy once dry. When I saw the result, I cried. It was horrible. I looked like a *girl.*

I remember looking in the mirror and holding my hair back, imagining myself as a boy. I thought I might make a good one. But how embarrassing would that be? It's impossible. And I'm so short.

Secondary school was a bit more difficult, due to the oft-cried phrase, ""is that a boy or a girl?""... well, obviously it was embarrassing. When people ask me, I don't know how to answer. Partly because it feels like a jibe, but partly because I don't want to answer. Often I say I'm ""whatever"". When people ask my pronouns, I'm just like..  ""use what you want dude"".

Even now I get taken for a boy. I'm not sure if this makes me uncomfortable solely because they must also assume I am 15 at most, or just because that's not how I identify, or just because I'm embarrassed for them! I know that I've internalised a lot of transphobia/homophobia from my dad, and that I don't want to come out as anything just because of what he might say, how he might taunt me, that kind of thing. I also know that I want to present sort of masculine, and have always resented the arse that my dad made clear that I had. (nothing sexual there, just inappropriate jokes/comments)

Mostly I just feel like a person, and definitely don't want to be taken for a girl. Being called ""girl"", ""lady"", any of that crap, makes my intestines tighten. Being looked upon by a male partner as a girl makes me uncomfortable. Thinking about it, this is probably why sex has been kind of a problem.

Recently I was thinking along the lines of ""right well though I feel sort of agender I'm going to keep my pronouns as she/her because otherwise I'm giving in to gender norms"".. but I'm starting to realise that part of gender identity is to do with how you want people to treat you. I'm starting to realise what social dysphoria actually is, and that it exists, and that I have it. I always thought the only dysphoria was physical dysporia and being misgendered. And also, I may have physical dysphoria. I'm never sure what to think of my breasts. Fortunatlely they're small. I never wear dresses or skirts - because I hate how they make me feel.

I am wondering if anyone has gotten married and if you have any tips and such for a non-binary wedding!!

My partner is AFAB and MostlyCis. I am AFAB Agender/NB.

My party will pretty much be a mix of genders and presentations. However hers will likely be all ciswomen. I have very strong feelings about not forcing anyone to dress a certain way and I feel having her party all in the same outfit is going to be really odd. any thoughts on that?

On a second note I do not think I will have a Best Person. I will simply be referring to my whole party as my Best People. Does anyone have experience in this aspect? I am looking for ways to explain this when I do ask my people to stand but cant seem to find anything to help navigate this kind of thing.

I actually coined it around the time I made [this old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/5xkb9y/neurogenders_and_internalized_ableism_read_this/) (and I think I posted it elsewhere first, so it's likely older than reddit says it is!), and indeed it is a kind of neurogender. It has to do with plurality and I feel like [these resources](http://areweplural.com/) would be better at explaining it because plurality is different for everyone.

For me, I am mostly median (see resources above), and different Is have different genders.

so uh, like, I consider myself pluralgender in terms of identity/brain sex/etc, but right now I am a woman in terms of gender. so that also means I'm currently going by she/her pronouns. however, if I switch to someone who isn't a woman, I'll probably want a different set of pronouns.

some ppl think sex and gender are the same, and that's fine - on an *individual* level. if you look at the full picture, you'll just... notice you're actually excluding genderfluid and pluralgender ppl... well I mean hopefully you'd notice.

I don't believe gender and sex are really the same, because of this. because I feel like it excludes/invalidates me.

anyway, that's all! feel free to say what you think about sex and gender if you want, I just hope I showed you a different perspective on it!

262,2018-07-22 23:35:59,9124zz,15,16,"Hi all,

I'm I another phase of doubt again. I stopped questioning not long ago in favor of being non binary. Now I'm back to doubting and feeling fake.

My experience after learning about non binary identities around 1.5 years ago, resulted in an extended period of questioning my gender identity (AMAB). First I thought I was a Trans woman, but this doesn't fit my experience either, as I feel good or indifferent about my body. Sometimes I wished I had a female body, but not as often as I'd expect Trans women to wish and I don't feel like I would change my manners and thinking much. In retrospect I realized that I always was fascinated at the idea of shape-shifting/temporal gender swapping and that I'd consider that the perfect solution for me.

As I don't see a clear transition goal (at least medically), I don't think that I will do anything medically soon.

My questions are:

How do you feel valid?

Is my experience valid?

How do you distinguish between gender non conformity (not really sticking to gender roles and all that stuff) and being non binary?

How do you know that it's the right thing and not just an excuse for something else(issues with self worth, being bad at performing as male ) /wanting to be part of a group?

I guess this post somewhat degenerated into a rant, but it's an emotional topic for me. Therefore I thank everyone who read this post completely.

2. Secondary sex characteristics - these are things that develop during puberty and such, like breasts and facial hair 
3. Brain structure - Male and female brain structures develop differently 
4. Hormone levels - testosterone is more of a male hormone, estrogen is a female hormone, but the amount can vary. Look at your fingers‚Äîif your pointer figner is longer than your ring finger, you have more estrogen, while if t's the reverse, you have more testosterone. I'm a cisgendered female yet according to my finger length I have moe testosterone than estrogen 
5. Chromosomes - usually it's XX or XY, but there are some variations like XXY, XXX, etc. This ties into the other stuff like secondary sex characteristics

guys. it‚Äôs so frustrating. 
my dad is suportive of my being trans on the surface. uses my name and pronouns. but as soon as i express the desire to do anything physical he tries his darndest to dissuade me and poke holes in my reasoning. last year i started t behind his back after trying for weeks to explain to him why i needed to. i didnt Need his approval to start i just wanted him to be in my corner so bad. he was going to try and make me go to multiple doctors for 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th opinions and didnt understand the redundancy when i already had a therapist and various heathcare providers. he just wanted me to keep asking until someone told me HE was right, even though he‚Äôd never admit that. he compared hrt to cancer in that it would be insane of me to do any treatment without top specialists signing off on it.

now since then i‚Äôve expressed to him how much happier i am with hrt and he seems to believe me and does support me but now that i‚Äôm getting top surgery consultations its back to square one. he is absolutely infuriating me because even after the 7 years ive been out to him he keeps going in circles around the ‚Äúhow do you KNOW‚Äù and ‚Äúbut you don‚Äôt SEEM masculine to ME‚Äù questions that ive explained carefully and as effectively as i can manage 100s of times. 
he told me he hopes i decide not to do it, and that it‚Äôs keeping him up at night. 

that just hurt. he hopes i decide not to do something that has the potential to bring me so much happiness and i just can‚Äôt make him understand why its important to me. he is losing sleep in anxiety over something i see as a future of freedom and (overused joke) a weight of my chest. 

i need his financial support in order to go through with top surgery within the next couple years because i am a full time student and really can‚Äôt handle more than an occassional couple shifts at my min wage job. im going to have him visit my therapist to talk but he‚Äôs so stubborn i dont know if it will help. 

what makes it more frustrating is that he keeps telling me he wants to understand me and he wants to learn but nothing i say gets through his skull. he Wants to want to learn but i think he just wants to cling to the daughter i never was. even so, i cant help but feel like if i was a trans man he‚Äôd have an easier time but being nonbinary just gives him so much fuel to doubt me.

How do I even start something like this? I'm already married and have my life set, so idk what I would even do with this information, but it's been keeping me awake so I'm asking.

I suppose I'll just list the reason I think I might be vs some things that trip me up. I was always more feminine than my peers. It's something I've always like and I didn't get as much flack for it as daytime tv suggested I would. I actually got through primary school and college without ever hearing much about other identities. I got married and I always joked with people saying I was the wife in the relationship. I perform the more traditionally feminine roles in both the house and the relationship and prefer it that way. Once trans people because more well known I found myself asking if I was trans. However, even though I love and identify with my feminine traits I found that I A) had a number of masculine traits that I valued as well and didn't want to cast off and B) I assume that maybe I am not aware of how masculine I am because it's just the role I have been playing (at least in part) for so many years that I don't notice many of those traits. Then it was like two years before I actually found out what non-binary means. (Which seems like it may fit?)

But then, even if i had a machine that could scan my brain and say, ""Yep, you're definitely non-binary,"" I'm not sure that it would lead to many changes in my life, since I'm so founded at this point. It seems kinda disingenuous to say, ""hey, I discover something new about myself, but it didn't change much."" I also don't want to trivialize anyone else's journey; I know there are a lot of people who went through a lot of pain and I don't wanna be like, ""Hey let me play too!""

Also, if it matters, I went through the most upvoted selfies in this subreddit and I don't think I'd ever want to present in the way that they do. But I definitely would wear skirts and dresses if it were socially acceptable (and I wasn't so hairy.)

I've been thinking of posting something like this on various social media/support groups but I'm worried about how it will be received. You all seem lovely in the responses I have read from the archived posts, so thanks in advance for any and all responses!

I read another post about a month ago regarding this topic (forestmango 's post) but it didn't answer all of my questions so I hope it's okay if I post this here?

I'm a cis(?) woman currently questioning my gender.

It has a lot to do with not understanding/feeling alienated from womanhood/femininity in one breath (and being okay with that, having the freedom of being andro-presenting, rejected girly things/never liked them in the first place) but also I feel ashamed because I am not ""feminine enough"" for my current gender.

Being currently identified as an adult woman, I feel constantly pressured to present fem all the time and to conform to the gender binary. I never did when I was a kid- but it's nice to look nice and get complimented for your efforts. (It takes so much energy out of me to present fem when I'm not feeling fem) But I'm not sure if that's because they think I look nice, or they like the fact that I'm presenting ""correctly"" to my assigned gender.

I have no idea what it means to be a woman (take away the female biology) truly but I really want to know. It's so hard for me to grasp. I feel like Ariel wanting to be a part of the 'pretty fem world' but never feeling welcome unless I bring the correct dress code and even then- I still feel left of center in women's spaces. It's a weird disconnect/connect situation that I haven't quite figured out yet. 

(I was thinking of opening a conversation with some of my trans-fem friends and ask how they would describe womanhood and how they feel it, but I'm not sure if that's a shitty question that I shouldn't ask.)

Some days I can really feel the fem energy very strongly but most days I just feel like a person and I want to be treated as such. I've come to terms with I might be genderqueer/genderfluid moreso than non-binary or cis but I don't want to take away from people who are really aligned with those labels. 

Whenever I look at my own face and it doesn't align with what I have in my head I can't recognize myself and I feel so sad that I can't just be the way I want to look, or accept myself as is.

I also feel a strong desire to express my truth (through music, I'm a musician in a lot of women//trans//GNC empowered spaces) -that you don't have to be feminine/fem presenting to be a valid woman. But how can I do that if I don't even believe it in myself? I want to be confident that you can be andro/masc + a woman, or feminine and Non-Binary but I haven't accepted myself as either of those when I know I should.

I don't want to invade any spaces or take any resources I'm just really lost and uncomfortable in my own skin.

I can't tell if I'm having trouble being myself (A GNC fem/andro cis woman) and accepting that that is okay!
OR
Actually a Non-binary person who feels different energies and has/wants a strong connection to womanhood and the women around me.

I'm so sorry if this came off as very rambly. My non-binary friend that I spoke to last year (amab) said that the feelings I have would still make me cis and I believe them to a degree but I still feel as if something is off.

I've been trying out She/her and they/them pronouns recently and it feels really nice! Rebecca Sugar one of my favorite creators just came out as a Non-Binary woman and that made me feel really at ease to know someone else might get it! But if I'm not Non-Binary, I don't want to incorrectly use the label.

Thanks again for reading this whole dang thing, I've been feeling very restless about this for so long. Part of me knows you can be an andro woman and be valid, but that doesn't feel quite right. Everything that comes with womanhood and femininity sucks in this world because it's perceived as ""lesser"" so that might add to it? Maybe some internalized misogyny in there? If anyone can relate or offer some advice, I'm open to any and all comments even if they are negative. Thanks again &lt;3

TBH, most people would have no idea that I feel like an enby because I live with such enormous pressure to conform.  My wife and I have come to an agreement that ""boundaries"" shall consist of me dressing and presenting masculinely when we go out together, but I can do as I please around the house.  (She says she is afraid that someone might do something to us.)

So... around the house, I wear a dress from time to time, and at first, it's like, ""Oh cool!  I can wear different clothes and see how they feel"", but after a bit, it's like, ""Okay, I'm wearing a dress.  Whatever...""

Trying to learn to express myself as an enby means far more to me than just wearing a dress or changing my hairstyle.

**The first time I felt a trifle of gender euphoria about not being cismale** was when my wife used to tease me by playfully insinuating that I am gay.  (I am strictly gynoromantic.)  Whenever she did this, I would smile and put on some excessively feminine body language and saying something like ""Oh really, Dear?  You think that I am gay?  I want to hear all about it, Sweetheart!"" and we would both laugh, and **I really enjoyed it**.

When I actually have a serious conversation and came out as trans-enby, this fun came to a screeching halt.  She is afraid of her husband becoming something she is no longer attracted to, and she won't even play about it anymore.

So, to me, being non-binary means exactly what the word means: ""not one or the other"".  So, I've been wondering if anyone here has had any success with presenting gender-fluid, gender-queer, androgynous, or agender behaviors and mannerism.

If so, what did it feel like?  How to people respond?

I'm a somewhat closeted transmasculine non binary person. I currently live in Asia for work and present as my cis gender to make life easier for myself socially essentially. Unfortunately I plan on living in Asia for about seven more years into the future to achieve some personal life goals of mine before returning to the states where I can probably transition medically via HRT to reach a more androgynous place in presentation and potentially in mindset as well. Anyway, I would describe myself as an effeminate (trans)man. I find androgyny to be the ultimate beauty ideal and find myself drawn to androgynous people. I feel like carving a life out in society as a non binary person though can be quite difficult and confusing at times. If someone is sure of their gender, that is if they identify as a binary gender such as male or female, that will reflect in their official documents, etc, but for those of us who don't identify as a binary gender neither of them feel completely right. This is the case for me anyway. I can manage living with the gender I was assigned at birth because I enjoy effeminate things. The rest I'll have to live with and stave off dysphoria with positivity and hope for the future. As much as I want to become androgynous at times there are moments for example when I'm wearing a skirt presenting as female (as usual) and I think about the future, and transitioning and if I appear male to people having to present as male to be socially accepted and that meaning I'd likely have to wear pants or shorts and then feeling a kind of sadness over the loss of being able to openly wear skirts without fear if I have more of a masculine form. I feel like approaching androgyny from the binary female side seems easier than the binary masculine side, in that femininity has more flexibility and freedom than masculinity, at least in American society. In Asia, ironically, in comparison to America, it seems more fluid and free. Men where I live would likely be considered metrosexual in America. Anyway, back to the point. Neither male or female feels right on official documents, so which do I chose? That's difficult. Dating as a non binary person or trans person seems relatively difficult as well and is honestly another part of the reason I suppress my trans identity at times, because navigating the dating world as a cis person (correct term?) is so much easier and the dating pool seems so much larger. That's such a discouraging thing about being trans, the inevitable rejection due to your plumbing situation, which as a transman you have little control over because none of the options, at least to me, end in satisfying results. Anyway (sorry I'm all over the place I have ADHD) I also think about getting married and having kids some day. I worry about raising kids as a non binary or trans person, though our generation seems more open to such things. I also have no idea what I would wear at my wedding. A dress? A suit?

327,2018-07-28 20:34:37,92p80w,2,16,"This is going to be a bit of a rant, sorry.

I call myself a non-binary trans girl, for convenience's sake and a way of saying ‚Äúnot binary, not a guy‚Äù. But I don't know if that label really fits me. What‚Äôs actually happening is that I‚Äôm in flux between ""girl"" and ""none pizza"", with a lack of gender winning out most of the time. I'm considering laser (I hate having facial hair) and other ways to look more androgynous, but I can probably never ‚Äútransition‚Äù in the sense of hormones or surgery. Mentally, I'm squicked by the idea of growing breasts; it doesn‚Äôt seem to fit my internal body map. And then, this gets stirred together with a general dislike of having my body sexualized and looked at in an objectifying way. I feel like I'm dealing with some DFAB trans issues in a DMAB body, and it confuses the hell out of me. I know agender DMAB folks are out there, and I know the term demigirl exists for those of us who still feel a connection to the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù category, but I still feel like a fake in most trans and even non-binary spaces.

Part of me worries that I‚Äôm appropriating an experience that isn‚Äôt mine, and that I just want the social benefits of being a girl without any of the social or physical drawbacks. I feel like female-read people are more trusted by others, less likely to come off as creepy when they joke or flirt, have more freedom to act in ways atypical of their gender, and have closer and more intimate friendships. I‚Äôm also horribly touch-starved, which feeds into this.

But then I look at transfeminine spaces, and a lot of the things they list as positives ‚Äî yay boobs! yay skirts! ‚Äî don‚Äôt read as positive at all to me. I feel stuck because I can‚Äôt perform gender in a way that both feels good to me and is understood by others. Masculinity is the default for gender, the standard, and femininity is difference and deviation. So anything society views as less gendered is automatically read as male. Fr‚Äôex, I like wearing my hair short, but in other people‚Äôs eyes, that doesn‚Äôt signify anything other than male. At best, I‚Äôm read as a twink, never a tomboy.

FWIW, I‚Äôm in my mid-thirties, very slightly built, and have been very thin all my life regardless of what or how much I eat. I look about half my physical age, which I kind of like, but I don‚Äôt like talking about it or revealing my real age to people who don‚Äôt know me well.

I'm slightly romantically and sexually interested in women, but I don't really consider myself a lesbian, or straight for that matter. Just a person who might maybe have a partner someday, but honestly isn't in a rush to start anything.

So... demi-ace, demigirl, and agenderflux? I don't know. Without a good way to realize them, all those labels weigh on me.

And then, this gets stirred together with a general dislike of having my body sexualized and looked at in an objectifying way. I feel like I\'m dealing with some DFAB trans issues in a DMAB body, and it confuses the hell out of me. I know agender DMAB folks are out there, and I know the term demigirl exists for those of us who still feel a connection to the ‚Äúgirl‚Äù category, but I still feel like a fake in most trans and even non-binary spaces.\n\nPart of me worries that I‚Äôm appropriating an experience that isn‚Äôt mine, and that I just want the social benefits of being a girl without any of the social or physical drawbacks. I feel like female-read people are more trusted by others, less likely to come off as creepy when they joke or flirt, have more freedom to act in ways atypical of their gender, and have closer and more intimate friendships. I‚Äôm also horribly touch-starved, which feeds into this.\n\nBut then I look at transfeminine spaces, and a lot of the things they list as positives ‚Äî yay boobs! yay skirts! ‚Äî don‚Äôt read as positive at all to me. I feel stuck because I can‚Äôt perform gender in a way that both feels good to me and is understood by others. Masculinity is the default for gender, the standard, and femininity is difference and deviation. So anything society views as less gendered is automatically read as male. Fr‚Äôex, I like wearing my hair short, but in other people‚Äôs eyes, that doesn‚Äôt signify anything other than male. At best, I‚Äôm read as a twink, never a tomboy.\n\nFWIW, I‚Äôm in my mid-thirties, very slightly built, and have been very thin all my life regardless of what or how much I eat. I look about half my physical age, which I kind of like, but I don‚Äôt like talking about it or revealing my real age to people who don‚Äôt know me well.\n\nI\'m slightly romantically and sexually interested in women, but I don\'t really consider myself a lesbian, or straight for that matter. Just a person who might maybe have a partner someday, but honestly isn\'t in a rush to start anything.\n\nSo... demi-ace, demigirl, and agenderflux? I don\'t know. Without a good way to realize them, all those labels weigh on me.

I've been doing a lot of questioning, exploring and general soul searching. When I first came to the realization that something about my gender was off I buried it deep. For about 3 years. Then inÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªøÔªø¬†January of this past year I finally allowed my self to accept the feelings. At this point the dysphoria washed over me and nearly drowned me. I was so consumed with dysphoria and my gender it was all I could think about. I thought for sure I was trans ftm.¬†

Then after a few months the dysphoria and intensity of the emotions started to settle until I realized I'm not ftm, or at least I dont believe I am.¬†

Suddenly there was no dysphoria and I enjoyed being female. I'm not super feminine but I do love being a female....sometimes.¬†

The more i pay attention to myself and my gender and dysphoria the more i realize i am both. I am either 100% female or 100% male.¬†

I have come to love exploring and learÔªøning myself. I used to look in the mirror and hate who I saw staring back at me, but ever since I've accepted my Male side I actually love me. I love my female side and love my Male side. After nearly 31¬†years of not loving myself I've learned I love me. Dysphoric male days are hard because I dont have the correct body, the voice, the beard and certainly dont pass as a guy, however, My husband uses male pronouns and my guy name on Male days. Learning to wear boxers, a binder, and a packer, and gluing a beard on my face helps for sure. I dont go out like that yet, but am hoping one day soon I'll get the nerve to slowly start presenting male. I dont want to come out to anyone. I'm happy being me and seeing where that goes.

Anyways, I was just excited that I'm learning more about myself and becoming more accepting of myself. For now I found and have adopted the label bigender. I love this for me. If down the road I find I'm more dysphoric and have more Male days than not, I may decide to transition. But for now....im good.

363,2018-07-30 22:11:05,938lax,2,2,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to this sub, and this explanation is going to be jumbled and messy, so buckle in. Apologies in advance if none of this makes sense. :/ 

So I've pretty much lived my whole life identifying as female; when I was a kid, though, I would idolize male characters in tv shows and movies. I proudly called myself a tomboy and vehemently rejected anything I deemed ""girly,"" sometimes even wishing I'd been born a boy. Most of the time, though, I didn't dislike that I was a girl, but it was more of the restrictions placed on me and what was expected from me. I didn't really feel like a girl, but I didn't really feel like a boy. As I grew up and became a teenager, I'd watch the way male characters in films would react to situations, even mundane mannerisms like body language and facial expressions; I almost always could only relate to male characters. But like I said before, I was always aware of gender roles (even if I didn't have the terms to articulate it then), so I'd watch these male characters and think, ""Why can't girls/women act like that?"" or ""Why can't I be like that?""

By college, I started learning more about gender studies and lgbtqa issues, and I chalked up my childhood feelings as being internalized misogyny--it's not that I wanted to be a male as a kid, I just idolized what those characters represented to me. That said, I've been thinking more and more about how I actually feel in regards to my own gender and identity. And I'm thoroughly confused (such a plot twist, I know). So overall, I feel like I mainly (maybe 55% of the time) identify as female, I think? I'll get more into that--but the other remaining time, I don't really identify as anything. I know for sure I don't want to be seen as male, so I suppose I'd label that other \~half as agender. I don't experience dysphoria, but I also don't really see my body and think, ""Yup, I feel feminine."" It's just kind of there, and I've lived my whole life in my body, so I'm fine with it. But I guess I'm trying to figure out, if I feel like I identify as female \~half the time, what does that even mean?

\-Besides concealer, I don't wear makeup anymore except for special occasions--same goes for things like dresses. I dress pretty casually and androgynously. But the thing is, that's gender expression. Makeup isn't inherently female; short hair isn't inherently male; etc. etc. you guys already know this.

\-Do I feel like I'm female because I act in certain ways? Do I feel like part of me is agender because some of my actions don't feel female? But obviously actions themselves aren't inherently female or male either; like I mentioned earlier, it's about how gender roles are presented in media and how we're conditioned to adhere to the binary, right?

\-And it can't be related to how I feel about my body because I know that body parts aren't inherently gendered. 

I don't know if any of this makes sense. I just feel like I'm trying to figure out a way to make sense and order of my feelings and perceptions but with hazy definitions based around abstract concepts. I know I can identify (or not identify) any way that I feel is comfortable to me, but I can't even make sense of what exactly I feel to begin with. :/ ",NonBinary,Figuring things out with definitions that make no sense to me,1533013865.0,"{'created_utc': 1532988665, 'id': '938lax', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 2, 'selftext': 'Hi everyone,\n\nI\'m new to this sub, and this explanation is going to be jumbled and messy, so buckle in.

I am AMAB non-binary and trying to learn more about T. My levels are low for an AMAB person not currently undergoing any hormone treatments - 236. Hormone specialist said, based on that and my naturally elevated E (in 60s), that she would have expected someone who is AMAB with my hormone levels to experience gender dysphoria. I am not sure what that means, since my understanding is that hormones do not directly influence gender identity. 

My question in general is what T levels, pre any HRT, look like for AMAB people. Do AMAB people experiencing gender dysphoria have levels of T that vary in any consistent way from cis AMAB people? My gut intuition would be no, but I am curious. Also I am trying to figure out why my own hormones are so off from a typical cis AMAB person. Does what I am describing resonate with anyone here?

I have stopped going to the local transgender support group.  I give myself hours and hours to femme up for it (and I even have a girlfriend willing to do my make-up for me).  But when I get to the point where I've shaved my face and showered and it's time to get dressed, I either get unbearably nervous and/or I manifest these strong headaches.  I think the headaches are a defense mechanism, my inner critic subconsciously trying to protect me from rejection.  If I'm in too much pain to leave the house, no one can see and reject my girl self.  I hate going in boy mode and introducing myself with my female name.  I feel like a fraud, especially when most everyone else is dressed and looking good.  

I would really like to be able to attend the trans events that are 90 minutes away.  Those ladies don't just have meetings.  They go out, dance, and have fun.  I got to hang with them after Pride one year.  But it's going to take a lot of baby steps to get to that point.  

I put a lot of my female self on the back burner about six years ago to deal with family drama.  And then it kept going.

This is small potatoes to some of you who are brave enough to be transitioning/have transitioned, but to me it was a big deal. I've always been afraid of the judgment and how I'd be treated if I did so.

Also, for background, I am most probably trans but too much of a pussy to go through with any actual transitioning (mainly because I couldn't bear to come out to my family, who is not really cool with that kind of thing and would disown me). So I settle for dressing up and pretending, which I've always done in private, until last night.

The place I went was a drag show at a gay bar, so pretty much the most supportive possible environment for my first time doing this. Though of course I still had to walk to and from my car out in the ""regular"" world. One of my neighbors, who hangs out on his porch all the time, saw me and did look pretty surprised... I do wonder if he'll say anything to me next time he sees me.

Overall, people paid far less attention to me than I feared. In fact, after I was starting to feel comfortable I kinda wanted more attention, because I thought I was looking pretty cute tbh! Of course, it was a gay bar, so not all that surprising.

One thing I noticed is that when interacting with others, women (who I don't know) were far more likely to physically touch me, like a light shoulder touch or whatever, which is something that basically never happens as a man. Everybody was really nice, I did get a lot of smiles, and even got called ""sweetie"" (which I liked, and also something that never happens as a man).

Holy shit is it a bitch to stay in heels for hours though! I've worn them around the house of course, but never for that long continuously before. And they were wedge heels, not even crazy stilettos or anything. That part is really gonna take some getting used to.

Definitely feeling a lot more confident, and will be making more trips out while dressed.

I‚Äôve looked into gender dysphoria and have read stories about trans men and even trans women. I couldn‚Äôt relate to every single detail about trans men, but I related to over a handful of it. 

I noticed that a sign of gender dysphoria or just a sign that you could be transgender in general is having a general discomfort with life. Well, not exactly general, but you just feel so uncomfortable with literally everything. 

I‚Äôm uncomfortable with my body, uncomfortable with the way I live and where I live, and it‚Äôs just an overall feeling of being uncomfortable. It just doesn‚Äôt feel right. Nothing feels right. I‚Äôve noticed how I feel when people refer to me as a girl and part of the time it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna act like that didn‚Äôt happen‚Äù and other times it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI hate this don‚Äôt say my name don‚Äôt say that‚Äù I keep those feelings to myself though. The idea of being referred to as a male is a little uncomfortable and I‚Äôve done it multiple times. I end up feeling scared and uncomfortable and I turn back. I believe that could be because I‚Äôm not used to it and I‚Äôm afraid that they may find it weird and still see me as a girl. 

I have a friend who is ftm and we‚Äôre very close. He always lets me ask him questions and I asked him if he felt uncomfortable and nervous about wearing boxers at first. He said yes but he got used to it and now cannot imagine wearing panties again. I hate panties and have never worn them but I think I‚Äôd wanna try wearing boxers somehow. I just wanna take small steps to see what feels the most right and what makes me feel better. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has felt the general dissatisfaction with life and felt uncomfortable from just existing. Possibly even felt paranoid or this unexplainable sense of dread that you‚Äôll die. Maybe it‚Äôs the news that‚Äôs making me feel this way. I just wanna know if I‚Äôm not alone.

I believe that could be because I‚Äôm not used to it and I‚Äôm afraid that they may find it weird and still see me as a girl. \n\nI have a friend who is ftm and we‚Äôre very close. He always lets me ask him questions and I asked him if he felt uncomfortable and nervous about wearing boxers at first. He said yes but he got used to it and now cannot imagine wearing panties again. I hate panties and have never worn them but I think I‚Äôd wanna try wearing boxers somehow. I just wanna take small steps to see what feels the most right and what makes me feel better. \n\nI‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has felt the general dissatisfaction with life and felt uncomfortable from just existing. Possibly even felt paranoid or this unexplainable sense of dread that you‚Äôll die. Maybe it‚Äôs the news that‚Äôs making me feel this way. I just wanna know if I‚Äôm not alone.

Her father took  her off of HRT suddenly so I am worried for her physical well being. I  don't really want to get the police involved however- they don't have  the best track record with trans women and they might put her parents on  high alert.

So I‚Äôve been thinking that maybe I‚Äôm trans for a few months and then, while speaking to one of my trans friends, it just sorta clicked.

I‚Äôve never felt particularly ‚Äúmanly‚Äù or that the label of ‚Äúman‚Äù fit me. Since I was about 19 I started identifying as non-binary. That worked while I was studying because I could just wear and act however I wanted but then I graduated and had to get a real job. I grew a beard and started acting more masc to fit in with the kind of people I work with. (Coming out as trans at work is gonna be HELL but that‚Äôs for future me to worry about.) So the acting manly thing really triggered some dysphoria and discomfort for me. I thought maybe I just wanted to present as NB more often (I use they/them pronouns) but, long story short, I‚Äôm a woman.

I‚Äôve come out to a few close friends and it‚Äôs been amazing. They‚Äôve been so supportive and helpful and caring and it‚Äôs made me feel incredible. Obviously I‚Äôm a long way off HRT or any procedures, but I have an appointment with my doctor to get the ball rolling soon.

My problem is the interaction I had with my partner when I came out to her (cis woman, been together 7 years). She‚Äôs always been accepting of and comfortable with me identifying as NB but I‚Äôm starting to think that comes down to how masc I was presenting because of work and where I live. She doesn‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm trans. She is happy to be in a relationship with a woman and if I could flick a switch tomorrow and wake up a cis woman, she‚Äôs still be here and happy.

But she‚Äôs worried about our safety and how she‚Äôs going to have to approach her family. We may have to move because of the area we live in. Her family and our neighbours think I‚Äôm just a cis man because who has time for the NB conversation with obvious bigots? But I want to be an out trans woman. I want to present as a woman in public and at family events. And this seems to make her very uncomfortable. I understand the safety issue because I might have a hard time passing (big chin, like 3-foot shoulders and I have to shave my face twice a day), but I tried to convince her it‚Äôs all a long way off and I haven‚Äôt even spoken to a doctor yet. But for me it‚Äôs getting more and more real and I want things to move as quickly as possible. How do I make her feel OK? I told her I understood if she didn‚Äôt want to go through all this and that I‚Äôd understand if she wanted to leave. Her life shouldn‚Äôt have to get worse because of me, but she says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna have to do it because I love you‚Äù. Which was nice to hear but it feels like I‚Äôm forcing her into a different, dangerous life where she might have to cut ties with her family.

130,2018-07-13 01:07:11,8yfjxr,12,27,"Hey all, this is my first post here, and honestly I don‚Äôt know exactly what I‚Äôm asking for apart from hopefully respectful sharing of advice and life experience. I think I‚Äôm goin through a bit of an identity crisis right now, and friends always help with that. Please read to the end for a fuller understanding of where I‚Äôm coming from.

When I got to college I did what many do with their newfound freedom, I began to push the boundaries I previously had living in a conservative home and began to form my own identity apart from my family. I was attending a Christian college on a dance scholarship. I had been dancing ballet for almost a decade at that point, which meant I grew up with people assuming I was gay. I have never been attracted to men, so that was pretty problematic. I had mostly girl friends and few girlfriends. Anyway, at college I met a girl, Mona, online. She was from California, where I was from, and we seemed to have a lot in common. The hours I wasn‚Äôt spending doing school things or playing video games or dancing, we were talking. I began to think of her as my girlfriend. The problem was she only ever sent me 3 photos of herself, the same 3, whenever I asked. I sent her many, she sent only 3. Red flag, I know, with hindsight, but I began to love that person I messaged everyday. At first I thought that maybe she had gained weight or something had happened to where she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sending more recent or candid photos.

Eventually she began suggesting things. She maintained that she was a cisgender, heterosexual woman, however she would suggest I experiment with my roommates or ask if I had ever thought of sucking dick, along with many other things. Now, as I said, I came from a very conservative home, but grew up in the ballet world, meaning I really had no objection to anyone‚Äôs sexual orientation or identity, I just identified, at the time, as strictly hetero, and I felt like we were in a relationship together, at least that‚Äôs how I viewed it, so the thought of sexually experimenting with anyone else was out of the question. Eventually I began to connect the dots and had to confront the feelings I had. She kept suggesting trying things that can‚Äôt be done with the female body, and she would only send me the same 3 pictures over and over again. I realized that she was either very open minded and for some reason wouldn‚Äôt ever send new pictures, or that she was a trans woman or gay man that didn‚Äôt feel comfortable sharing more of themselves yet. 

To this day I don‚Äôt know what became of Mona. What I do know is that I came to the conclusion that regardless of her gender or sexual identity, whatever she looked like, I had come to know her. I loved her personality and her playfulness, her openness and how she honestly cared for me while we were getting to know each other. I came to the realization that whatever I thought my sexual identity to be, it had expanded to let her in. Whatever the whole truth was I was in love and it didn‚Äôt matter to me. But we lost contact, and my biggest regret is that I never had the opportunity to express all of that to her and that at the end of our 2 or 3 year correspondence I still hadn‚Äôt helped her feel comfortable enough in me or us for her to share all of herself with me.

That was.... 8 or 9 years ago. Since then I‚Äôve been married, had kids, and am now separated. Since meeting Mona, from mostly my inability to fully articulate what I felt or who I was afterward, because i am most definitely changed, my marriage struggled and Ive felt so conflicted for so long. My wife was born into the same religion I was, and we had tried to practice it especially after our kids were born, but one of the biggest things that shook me with regards to my identity was qualifying my experience with what I had been taught growing up about the LGBTQ community. Homosexuality is obviously taboo with conservative Christians, and the basis for that is a terrible and completely ignorant assumption that sexual and gender identity is purely a choice for those who don‚Äôt conform to cisgender norms, and that any act outside of that very small circle of understanding is a conscious rebellion against God. In other words, they disregard the concept that any member of the LGBTQ community can love like they do. They demean every single non-heteronormative relationship to it‚Äôs basest level as purely physical and therefore immoral. But I have loved a woman, and I have loved Mona. It felt just as impactful and life changing, I got the same butterflies, and both made me a better person. 

So here I am! Completely alone after 8 years of marriage, I don‚Äôt know what to believe with regards to my faith that I really do cherish and I don‚Äôt exactly know how I identify now. I know I do believe there is a God, and I believe God loves everyone regardless of who they are, how they identify, what race or religion they are, whatever. I know that whatever my next relationship will be, whether a cisgender woman or a trans woman, I will love them with equal fervor and hopefully as a more aware and whole partner. So what am I? Where do I fit in? Who are my people? Because the things I know now are not things that the people I have as friends or family now agree with. 

This has been a whole bunch of emotional vomit....I apologize. But any advice or support or friendship would be so very appreciated. Please be kind, if I said anything offensive or ignorant, please let me know politely, I have never shared this story with anyone at all.

my youngest brother has always been more attracted to feminine clothes - one of my first memories of him actively making choices is when he was 3 or 4 and he picked a pair of dainty white dress shoes and ran around the shoe store giggling like a maniac. his favorite color is pink pink pink pink pink, he sits cross-legged, has long hair (he flips out when my dad threatens to cut it. like, flips. out.) more stuff:

* loves painting his nails, wearing make up
* once stuffed tissue paper up his shirt to make a joke about boobs, then walked around the house staring at his chest. left the tissue paper in his shirt for like two hours
* always tells me when people mistake him for a girl/can't tell he's a boy in an excited voice (but he pretends its just funny)
   * i asked him if it bugged him when people couldn't tell if he was a boy and he said ""no.."" then stared blankly at the floor

there's way more i could list, but i'll keep this short.  the reason i'm reaching out to the internet for advice is bc he's starting to go thru puberty, aka tranny hell.  how do i support my possibly trans younger sibling and encourage him to explore his identity without ""pushing the tranny lifestyle"" on him?",trans,"i (ftm) think my younger sibling (11, m) is a trans egg. what the fuck do i do?",1531510871.0,"{'created_utc': 1531485671, 'id': '8yjmoe', 'num_comments': 12, 'score': 25, 'selftext': 'hi, to preface this i live in a very very liberal household (two of my parents r bi + have never forced gender roles on us) so it\'s not a question of if my family would accept him or not.\n\nmy youngest brother has always been more attracted to feminine clothes - one of my first memories of him actively making choices is when he was 3 or 4 and he picked a pair of dainty white dress shoes and ran around the shoe store giggling like a maniac. his favorite color is pink pink pink pink pink, he sits cross-legged, has long hair (he flips out when my dad threatens to cut it. like, flips. out.) more stuff:\n\n* loves painting his nails, wearing make up\n* once stuffed tissue paper up his shirt to make a joke about boobs, then walked around the house staring at his chest. left the tissue paper in his shirt for like two hours\n* always tells me when people mistake him for a girl/can\'t tell he\'s a boy in an excited voice (but he pretends its just funny)\n   * i asked him if it bugged him when people couldn\'t tell if he was a boy and he said ""no.."" then stared blankly at the floor\n\nthere\'s way more i could list, but i\'ll keep this short.  the reason i\'m reaching out to the internet for advice is bc he\'s starting to go thru puberty, aka tranny hell.  how do i support my possibly trans younger sibling and encourage him to explore his identity without ""pushing the tranny lifestyle"" on him?', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'i (ftm) think my younger sibling (11, m) is a trans egg. what the fuck do i do?', 'created': 1531510871.0}"

When we broke up I found myself at an impasse. My family has always been full of nutcases and abuse, so I broke away from that pretty early, and with my future completely tossed out the window, I've started to slowly become who I am inside.

I'm... confused. For five years I've been dealing with the secret that I thought that I was transgender, but now I'm not so sure.

I started questioning it at 12, but since I came out to my friends I started to question it. At which point I got myself into a negative feedback loop, saying over and over again:

1. The fact you're questioning it in the first place ought to amount to something.
2. But now you're questioning the questioning, that means you can't *definitely* be transgender.
3. But if I'm not, why would I still have doubts about it?

And so on. This is compounded from when I told my mum - probably not the best idea I've had - who despite believing in liberal values, has a hard time actually enforcing those values in her day-to-day life. She has an unconscious socially conservative alignment.

The friends I have told have been supportive and I'm happy I have people who do support me, but my mum's incessant questioning and repetition of things such as ""As your mother, I genuinely don't think you'd be any happier as a woman"" cuts deep but I don't know if it's because I agree or she is inadvertently shunning me.

For awhile I blew most of these things off as being a tomboy, but for some time now I've been feeling different. Moving into my teen years I started feeling very uncomfortable with the more feminine aspects of my body, especially my breasts, and I have always wanted to get rid of them and to have a flat chest. This desire has only grown as I've gotten older. Something else that really brought on these thoughts was when I was buying some new clothes a couple weeks ago. I have always worn boys clothing now and then (I feel it suits me better), but this time I tried on a bit of a nicer mens dress shirt. I remember when I looked in the mirror I actually felt kind of happy with my appearance for once. I felt more comfortable in my own skin, something that I struggle with a lot.

Underneath

That mask it fits so snug,

When she wakes up to the day.

Sometimes it‚Äôs so easy to forget,

There could be another way.

The slits too narrow for seeing,

The wood is old and worn.

Always it keeps her from being,

The person as she was born.

She can‚Äôt feel simple contact,

The mask makes sure of that.

It even covers her emotions,

To keep her from a laugh.

But somehow no one else sees

The disguise that‚Äôs plainly there.

Do they really not notice?

Or do they just not fucking care?

What makes a life worth living

When you it is a lie?

And the mask that hides your face

Makes you want to die.

If the truth would just come out.

Her life would change so much.

The mask need simply shatter,

For her skin to feel a touch.

But heavy are the words

To liberate her life.

So quiet stays her tongue,

As her soul continues its strife.",trans,A little Creative Writing,1532088909.0,"{'created_utc': 1532063709, 'id': '90d7i0', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 5, 'selftext': ""Here's a quick poem I wrote.

So I am a lovely lesbian who has recently moved to a new state and after getting involved in the LGBT community here (in a much bigger city than where I am from) I've made a few new trans friends (yeah!). I hadn't ever met any trans people before, so I was excited for the opportunity, but now I have a question about something I've noticed!

Anyway. So these new friends are still just that, new, so we are all getting to know each other but already I've noticed one thing about the trans folk in the community that seems different than the rest of us. So with my lesbian or gay friends, we talk about sex, who we are attracted to, and swap risqu√© stories ect. just like what the average mid-twenty year olds do. But the trans people in our group aren't always as vocal about themselves, and the participate in the conversation only when its in involving somebody else. After talking with some people about why it seems discussing sex in the trans community almost feels like taboo, because to me thats sorta what it felt like!, most everyone said something like ""well they are going through so much physically/emotionally ect. that we never wanted to push them, or make them feel uncomfortable.""

Well I feel like not feeling comfortable to talk/ask about it amongst friends is awful!!! I love having the comfortability to just joke, or share or whatever you feel comfortable with about your sex life with my buddies.

So my question is this. What would be the best way to bring up sexuality to a new trans friend? I am getting to know these folks really well, and even if they don't want to be as vocal about sex, I still want them to feel comfortable enough to feel like they could share with me if they wanted to! I think all love is beautiful, but I also don't want to offend them by just straight up asking ""so if you are a trans man, who do you like?""

But then also part two of the question. Is there any research about the tendencies of the trans community? Like, or most trans-men gay, or straight and the same for trans-women. Just curious!

235,2018-07-23 12:27:28,916men,7,2,"Hello.

I've been struggling to understand my gender identity. I am confused as to how I ""should"" express myself, whether it is useful for me to outwardly express my gender, how to deal with having an non-catered to body shape, and whether what I'm feeling is relatable to others in the trans community.   


I would like to share some of the experiences that lead me to my confusion. **I think what I'm looking for is for others who might have had similar experiences to share with me. Whether these are things they have related to, or which they may have more articulated thoughts on**. I'm particularly confused as to whether feelings of discomfort around being associated with the ""feminine"" are brought on by my being socialised as a ""lesser/oppressed"" gender, whether perhaps the role models I had or early childhood traumas shaped my understanding of my gender identity, or whether perhaps it's something more than that, (Whatever ""more than that"" even is?) or if that even matters.   


*I appreciate that there is a lot of text here that might be difficult to read, and I am so grateful to those of you who feel able to read all or part of it.*  


**To give some context, this is a bit about my family unit/society/early childhood traumas growing up: (CW: there's some racism/sexism/potential sexual abuse discussion in this paragraph)**

\-I was born biologically female, in NJ, in the early 90s. My mother was my primary guardian. Since my mother's first language was Spanish, and I grew up in a society which demonised Mexican immigrants, I think I thought lesser of my mother's intellect than she deserved. I was always white-passing, despite a large portion of my family being from Argentina. I didn't learn Spanish as a child and this made it difficult for me to connect to a lot of my mother and her family's culture. For other reasons, she had always been quite a vulnerable person and I did not think of her as somebody I aspired to be like. I did not always have a father figure present. My biological father died when I was 2, so I have almost no memories of him. My mother re-married to my step-father when I was about 5, and stayed with him until I was 11. I sometimes bonded with him over video games, outdoor activities, love of animals, and hockey games. We were never particularly close though, and hadn't kept in contact after their divorce. I didn't have any biological grand-fathers or uncles in my life, really. My Mother's family were mostly living in Italy, and my father's parent was essentially my (lesbian?) Grandmother, who's ex-man left her pregnant at 18 to go to Woodstock and live a free spirited hippie lifestyle.  I think just about all of the women in my life had been abused by their partners or family members, though I'm not sure how aware I was of this as a child. I remember my step father getting into physical fights with my mother, but I don't remember how one-sided this was or not. I had been (possibly?) molested multiple times as a 7 year old child by a male 15 year-old step-cousin, but honestly I always understood this as being kind of consensual. I was very sexually curious. I don't really know what to think about this looking back on it as it feels quite different to other's stories I've heard, but that's a bit of an aside. 

  
**Reflecting on my childhood (4-11ish), here's what I remember that sets of flags:**  


\-My mother gave me a very, very feminine name. I remember always wishing I could have a cooler nickname like the other kids.  In fact, when I moved to a new town at 11, I made up a new name for myself which wasn't masculine, but was much less ""soft"" sounding. 

\-I absolutely hated the colour pink.

\-I hated being called ""cute."" I think I might have even asked people to call me ""Beautiful"" or ""Handsome"". 

\-I tore the heads off of barbie dolls that my family would get for me. Sometimes I even play-tortured them. 

\-I refused to be a ""flower girl"" at my mother's second wedding, instead taking on the role of the ring bearer. (Which was typically a boy's role.)

\-I really liked video games and computers. My favourites were in the Mario series, Harvest Moon, Tomb Raider, Online RPG games, The Sims, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Kingdom Hearts, Star Fox. Not a lot of first person shooters. If I would be making a character in the game, I would usually make a female character that I thought was more attractive than myself.

\-My favourite TV shows were Thunder Cats, Sailor Moon, Pokemon, Gargoyles, The Mighty Ducks, and Xena the Warrior Princess.   

\-I really liked drawing and painting. This was probably one of the only things my mother and I bonded over. The focus of my drawings were most typically of natural/non-human things. Animals, trees, pokemon, landscapes... Although sometimes I would draw female characters from Disney films and things. I think my favourites were usually more fantastical, like The Little Mermaid or The Lion King. I also really liked Mulan.

\-I always had ""crushes"" on other young boys, even though I knew they would never really like me back. I was quite romantic, and lonely. I was always quite ashamed and secretive about this, though. 

\-I was very curious about sexuality from a very early age. Through having access to the internet in the 90s and online rpg games, I would seek out pornography in verbal and visual forms. I think this was probably largely female body focused pornography, and I was attracted to that. I remember having secret thoughts of aspiring to be a prostitute from as early as 7 years old or so.

\-I would find it made me feel good to go into boy's bathrooms. I don't know if this was rebelling against the norms for my sex or that I liked the ""shock factor"" of it. (I still do this, usually when I'm drunk.)

\-I was quite aggressive towards my peers at times, especially boys who made fun of me. I would bite kids ears in pre-school and have fond memories of kicking bullies in the balls. 

\-I never really followed any fashionable trends or thought about my body image until I was about 12, when I began to adorn myself in alternative clothing. (Went through Goth phase, Scene Queen phase, Grungey phase... Probably the earliest I remember of having any identity expression.)

**Teenage experiences / young adulthood / sexuality;**

\-At about 11, I started to go through puberty. I was also dealing with moving to a new town, my mother's divorce, and being separated from her due to her ill mental health. I ended up getting into a lot of trouble and generally being problematic. There are so many factors that I have no idea how much puberty and my own awareness of my changing body played into that. 

\-In my early teens, I remember feeling quite prejudiced towards most other girls around me. I didn't feel like I fit in amongst the very feminine girl groups who were into hair/make-up/fashion, etc. Although I had an interest in these things related to my ""alternative"" expression, I felt some kind of superiority to very feminine women. I assumed they weren't interested in more intellectual topics like I was. I only ever made friends with more ""edgey"" people because I assumed they might have interests more aligned to my own. I generally preferred to have male friends, but this was often a conflicting factor in my friendships because at the time I understood myself to be a straight girl. (i.e; I would make friendships which I often felt as if I was a target for romantic interest to my male friends. I felt they treated me differently because I was a girl.) I don't remember having had any obviously gender-queer or LGBT+ people around me in my early teens, although topics of bisexuality or homosexuality started to float around in the more ""alternative"" scenes as I grew into that. 

\-I had been in an unhealthy relationship when I was 15 with a man who was 19. Although unhealthy, this man helped me understand what I was attracted to in other people. I liked philosophy, the arts, and weird, metaphysical discussions of the absurdity of life. I liked people who were politically aware and ""intellectual"" types. I wrongly assumed on a subconscious level that I could not actually be romantically attracted to women because some part of me assumed this was not a feminine trait. 

\-After an extended experience of being institutionalised following psychological damage from that relationship, I suddenly found myself to be a fairly independent 17 year old.  I partied a lot, experimented with mind altering substances, and somewhere along the way ended up having a threesome with one of my girl friends and another man. After that experience, I started to pay more attention to my physical attraction to women. 

\-Typically, I dressed quite feminine albeit still pretty alternative. My aesthetic at the time was thrift shop dresses and short, asymmetric haircuts. 

\-Around the same time, I seemed to recognise a pattern of me being attracted to more effeminate men. Friends of mine would often confuse my romantic interests for gay men. (Perhaps this was related to me also be averse towards macho men or ""athletic"" people, on the more masculine side of the spectrum.)

\-Regarding my attraction to women, I generally felt this to be more physical than romantic at first. I didn't feel physical attraction in the same way to men, which led me to think that perhaps I was a lesbian. 

\-When I moved away to the UK for university, I experienced my first (complicated) relationship (of sorts) with a woman. It was a very physical attraction, and this was something that was new to me. I was attracted to her intellect as well, but I felt like the pull of her physicality was what kept me interested most. 

\-I shaved my head, and put myself on a very restrictive diet which allowed me to dress comfortably androgynous and feel expressive of my sexuality. (I've struggled with being overweight since puberty, and the effects of having a very obviously plump curvy body were unfavourable to me.)

\-After that relationship, I ended up working as a stripper. Ironically, this is when I first adapted a non-binary stripper name. It was just a way to make money for me, even though I had a largely male client base. 

\-Between 18-21ish, I thought I was a lesbian. I started hanging out in more LGBT+ communities as a consequence. I felt mostly attracted to feminine or androgynous women, though I have also had feelings of attraction towards several trans men and non-binary people during this time. 

\-I ended up in a more serious, romantic relationship with a woman in Italy for about 3 years. This was not a healthy relationship by the end of it. Towards the end I started to feel physical attraction to men again, and felt quite ashamed of this. In lesbian circles, I felt ""dirty"" for having these feelings.  The relationship ended largely because of my sexual confusion at the time.  


**Where I'm at now;**

 \-After accepting these sides of my sexuality, I think I can now comfortably say that I identity as pansexual. I have felt attraction to cis men, cis women, trans men, trans women, and non binary people. Though, I'm still not sure how I see my own gender identity or how this influences my relationships with other people. I like to think that the subjectivity of a person is the most important aspect of my attraction to them, though I feel perhaps I don't have a deep understanding of how gender identity shapes my particular interactions with partners or even friends of mine. 

\-I an known amongst friends by an androgynous name, although because the name I'm known as isn't very socially acceptable - I still feel I need to (uncomfortably) use my birth name for work/university/IDs/etc. 

\-I  happen to be in a long term relationship with a straight, cis-male at present. 

\-I have gained a lot of weight again, and as a consequence it is incredibly difficult for me to find trouser that will fit me and/or that are flattering. I tend to have reverted to wearing mostly dresses, if for nothing else because they will actually fit me regardless of my weight and height.  

\-I feel quite ashamed of my body. I think this is mostly because of my weight, though I also do have feelings of wishing that people did not assume I was a woman when they look at me. I do not feel I want to be perceived as a man, but rather that I wish it was not obvious what sex/gender I was at all. 

\-I dislike shaving, but I do shave occasionally because I feel that this is one form of ""attractiveness"" that I can control relatively easily. 

\-I take birth control (synthetic progesterone) which stops me from having cyclical, hormonal mood swings and from menstruating. The main motive for this is because I did not like how my hormones affected my mood and cognitive function. I also like that I can us this as way to feel less dictated by my female biology in general.   
\-I feel kind of misrepresented in how I express myself, because I probably come across as a bohemian looking, probably-straight cis-white-woman. 

\-I feel like I can't express myself differently because of my weight. I'm a quite curvy, very short person, and I just don't like how androgynous clothing looks on my body at the moment. I'm not exactly comfortable wearing dresses either, but that is what I have that fits and is affordable. 

\-I have grown my hair quite long, and although I dislike this, I feel it makes my face look more presentable and attractive because of my weight gain.

\-I tend to not wear make-up most of the time, but when I do, this is again one of the few ways I can feel attractive that is easily in my control.

\-I feel my interests tend to be in (typically) man-dominated areas. I'm into computer programming, games and game dev, science, philosophy, activism, and some other things. I feel less respected quite often in these circles because I present as a woman and because of the connotations around what that means. 

\-Throughout my life, I felt that my intellect was most respected and visible to others when I was thin and presented as more androgynous. 

\-I have struggled with severe ill mental health issues since puberty, and how others treat and perceive me has undoubtedly plays a role in this - I'm just not entirely sure how. 

\-Before weight was an issue, I have had some more typically feminine interests in things like acro/gymnastics/poll dancing, though I have an aversion to how looking like a woman influences how people perceive me and interact with me in these sports. (I.e, I want to be seen as strong, flexible, and self-disciplined rather than small, bendy, throw-able, and often sexualised.) 

\-When online, I take comfort in being able to refer to myself with gender neutral pronouns and not be assumed to be a woman. Although, because of my interests, people generally assume I am a man anyway and this also makes me uncomfortable.

\-Since engaging with feminist activism and philosophy, this has changed the way I think about myself and of femininity. Nonetheless, I'm not sure whether the best route to take for alleviating my feelings of not fitting the ""feminine"" side of the binary is to express in a more androgynous way or to work on empowering myself as a woman.

I wrongly assumed on a subconscious level that I could not actually be romantically attracted to women because some part of me assumed this was not a feminine trait. \n\n\\-After an extended experience of being institutionalised following psychological damage from that relationship, I suddenly found myself to be a fairly independent 17 year old.  I partied a lot, experimented with mind altering substances, and somewhere along the way ended up having a threesome with one of my girl friends and another man. After that experience, I started to pay more attention to my physical attraction to women. \n\n\\-Typically, I dressed quite feminine albeit still pretty alternative. My aesthetic at the time was thrift shop dresses and short, asymmetric haircuts. \n\n\\-Around the same time, I seemed to recognise a pattern of me being attracted to more effeminate men. Friends of mine would often confuse my romantic interests for gay men. (Perhaps this was related to me also be averse towards macho men or ""athletic"" people, on the more masculine side of the spectrum.)\n\n\\-Regarding my attraction to women, I generally felt this to be more physical than romantic at first. I didn\'t feel physical attraction in the same way to men, which led me to think that perhaps I was a lesbian. \n\n\\-When I moved away to the UK for university, I experienced my first (complicated) relationship (of sorts) with a woman. It was a very physical attraction, and this was something that was new to me. I was attracted to her intellect as well, but I felt like the pull of her physicality was what kept me interested most. \n\n\\-I shaved my head, and put myself on a very restrictive diet which allowed me to dress comfortably androgynous and feel expressive of my sexuality. (I\'ve struggled with being overweight since puberty, and the effects of having a very obviously plump curvy body were unfavourable to me.)\n\n\\-After that relationship, I ended up working as a stripper. Ironically, this is when I first adapted a non-binary stripper name. It was just a way to make money for me, even though I had a largely male client base. \n\n\\-Between 18-21ish, I thought I was a lesbian. I started hanging out in more LGBT+ communities as a consequence. I felt mostly attracted to feminine or androgynous women, though I have also had feelings of attraction towards several trans men and non-binary people during this time. \n\n\\-I ended up in a more serious, romantic relationship with a woman in Italy for about 3 years. This was not a healthy relationship by the end of it. Towards the end I started to feel physical attraction to men again, and felt quite ashamed of this. In lesbian circles, I felt ""dirty"" for having these feelings.  The relationship ended largely because of my sexual confusion at the time.  \n\n\n**Where I\'m at now;**\n\n \\-After accepting these sides of my sexuality, I think I can now comfortably say that I identity as pansexual. I have felt attraction to cis men, cis women, trans men, trans women, and non binary people. Though, I\'m still not sure how I see my own gender identity or how this influences my relationships with other people. I like to think that the subjectivity of a person is the most important aspect of my attraction to them, though I feel perhaps I don\'t have a deep understanding of how gender identity shapes my particular interactions with partners or even friends of mine. \n\n\\-I an known amongst friends by an androgynous name, although because the name I\'m known as isn\'t very socially acceptable - I still feel I need to (uncomfortably) use my birth name for work/university/IDs/etc. \n\n\\-I  happen to be in a long term relationship with a straight, cis-male at present. \n\n\\-I have gained a lot of weight again, and as a consequence it is incredibly difficult for me to find trouser that will fit me and/or that are flattering. I tend to have reverted to wearing mostly dresses, if for nothing else because they will actually fit me regardless of my weight and height.  \n\n\\-I feel quite ashamed of my body. I think this is mostly because of my weight, though I also do have feelings of wishing that people did not assume I was a woman when they look at me. I do not feel I want to be perceived as a man, but rather that I wish it was not obvious what sex/gender I was at all. \n\n\\-I dislike shaving, but I do shave occasionally because I feel that this is one form of ""attractiveness"" that I can control relatively easily. \n\n\\-I take birth control (synthetic progesterone) which stops me from having cyclical, hormonal mood swings and from menstruating. The main motive for this is because I did not like how my hormones affected my mood and cognitive function. I also like that I can us this as way to feel less dictated by my female biology in general.   \n\\-I feel kind of misrepresented in how I express myself, because I probably come across as a bohemian looking, probably-straight cis-white-woman. \n\n\\-I feel like I can\'t express myself differently because of my weight. I\'m a quite curvy, very short person, and I just don\'t like how androgynous clothing looks on my body at the moment. I\'m not exactly comfortable wearing dresses either, but that is what I have that fits and is affordable. \n\n\\-I have grown my hair quite long, and although I dislike this, I feel it makes my face look more presentable and attractive because of my weight gain.\n\n\\-I tend to not wear make-up most of the time, but when I do, this is again one of the few ways I can feel attractive that is easily in my control.\n\n\\-I feel my interests tend to be in (typically) man-dominated areas. I\'m into computer programming, games and game dev, science, philosophy, activism, and some other things. I feel less respected quite often in these circles because I present as a woman and because of the connotations around what that means. \n\n\\-Throughout my life, I felt that my intellect was most respected and visible to others when I was thin and presented as more androgynous. \n\n\\-I have struggled with severe ill mental health issues since puberty, and how others treat and perceive me has undoubtedly plays a role in this - I\'m just not entirely sure how. \n\n\\-Before weight was an issue, I have had some more typically feminine interests in things like acro/gymnastics/poll dancing, though I have an aversion to how looking like a woman influences how people perceive me and interact with me in these sports. (I.e, I want to be seen as strong, flexible, and self-disciplined rather than small, bendy, throw-able, and often sexualised.) \n\n\\-When online, I take comfort in being able to refer to myself with gender neutral pronouns and not be assumed to be a woman. Although, because of my interests, people generally assume I am a man anyway and this also makes me uncomfortable.\n\n\\-Since engaging with feminist activism and philosophy, this has changed the way I think about myself and of femininity. Nonetheless, I\'m not sure whether the best route to take for alleviating my feelings of not fitting the ""feminine"" side of the binary is to express in a more androgynous way or to work on empowering myself as a woman.   \n\n\n  \nVery open to hearing your experiences, interpretations, advice, or any other guidance you might have to help me understand myself more. &lt;3', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Confused, is this gender dysphoria or self-directed internalised misogyny?

When I was in primary school, I wanted to be a boy and I would tell people I wanted to get a sex change when I got older. My first primary didn't allow the girls to wear trousers/shorts and I was excluded from playing football because I was a girl but I always played other games with male friends. During this time I did have a girly, pink phase but it didn't last long and I started to watch boys shows and desired natural strength like boys had. When I switched school, I wore trousers/shorts and got to play football with mainly boys but I did get female friends. I wore boy's clothing outside of school too.

In highschool, I switched between trousers and skirts. However I wanted short, messy, boyish hair so I got it cut but it looked horrible and flat, it's a small thing but it really made me upset because I didn't feel boyish at all so I ended up growing it long on one side (shaved on the other side). After growing it I accepted being female and wore female clothing, I never spoke or thought much about becoming a male for a long while until college.

At college I experimented a couple times by dressing up like a guy and putting my hair up under a hat to make it look like I had short hair. I wasn't sure how I felt about it, I felt off in some way. I only like guys, I can't imagine being with women but I feel like I'm caught in the middle. I like women's clothes and having my hair long on one side but I want to look and feel stronger, have more muscles (I've started exercising). I also hate my genitals because of all the discomfort and pain they bring me, I've never liked it and I would rather have male genitals, I get jealous of my boyfriend for having them.

I want male genitals and to have more muscle mass but I don't think I want it enough to go through surgery.

Hi! AFAB here, age 15 (soon to be 16, *woot woot*). Recently, I've been having a lot of thoughts about transgenderism, and how it relates to me.

Ever since I can remember, I've always *WONDERED* what it's like to be a boy. I chalked it up to being curious, as every girl must be. The farthest memory I have of this is being about 3 or 4 and trying to picture my room if I'd gotten rid of all my tiaras, girly beanie babies, etc and replaced it with boys' toys--imagining if I was a boy. But, this didn't really stick and didn't seem too significant at the time. I grew up being okay with being female. I identified as female.

But, when I found out about sex, I didn't want to have a penis go into my vagina. I wanted to be the one with the penis. I wanted to play that part. These thoughts have always kind of been there but I haven't really made a big deal about them. I remember at one point, though, later in my adolescence, pretending that I had a penis really excited me. But, once again, I kind of just let these thoughts go.

Since about age 10, I've been interested in FTM transgender individuals, and really admired their transitions. I kind of envied them, at times. I, verily, gave the idea a bit of thought, but more or less without myself in the equation. I imagined what it would be like to be transgender, but more about being male in general. The strong jawline, the shoulders, the beard, the hair, the voice, the way they dress...their penises. It was less about wanting to be with one than it was about BEING one. But not me, I was sure. Not in this lifetime. The thoughts, as always, drifted to the back of my head and stayed there, out of the spotlight for a long time.

When I was about 13-14, I went through a process of trying to define my sexuality (after a LONG, ugly, depressing internal battle, I rested upon queer, knowing that I like women and men, but how much of either often changes). For awhile, I was primarily attracted to women. But, when paying mind to queer media, for some reason, I always identified more with gay men (stick with me here). While identifying as a female, a relationship with a male doesn't seem very desirable to me. I don't really like that dynamic. But, when I imagine being with a male AS a male, it just feels so...right. I get these really strong butterflies when I see two men together, almost as if I'M the one experiencing this. This is sort of silly, but at one point, I was really sad that I wasn't born as a man because I would never be able to have this sort of relationship. It was the point where I figured in some other life, I would be born a boy so I could happily be with one. As female, I'm currently with a female, but I'm beginning to question if this is really fulfilling for me--if it's what I want. I know that even if I remain a female, I will always wish that I was a man that was with a man. Is that weird????

AND FINALLY, now. How am I fairing now? Well, a few weeks ago, whilst on vacation, I watched this movie called ""God's Own Country,"" which is about a male v. male relationship. I literally felt so connected to this dynamic, to the beingness of these two cis-gendered men, that it literally frightened me a little bit. Almost if this is the narrative I'm supposed to be living, but am not because I stupidly imagined that I'll just have to be female until I die and become a man in some hypothetical reincarnation lol. I started wondering if it's possible that I might be...transgender. A strange inquisition for me. It felt funny, weird, but very exciting to ponder this about...myself? Yes, me. What if I, a troubled 15 year-old, might be transgender? YIPES idk.

Ever since I've done more reading about it, finally applying it to myself, the idea has absolutely psyched me up. The idea of being a boy is so thrilling and exciting and...*right*. But, I don't, and haven't really ever, struggled with strong dysphoria. Little bits here and there, sure, but never to the point where I HATED being female. Actually, I've never hated the fact that I am, biologically, female. It still doesn't really BOTHER me, it's just more or less something I wish I just wasn't. But, if I was never able to transition, I think I would be okay, just probably really bummed and I would most likely just fantasize about it. Does this mean I might just be projecting this fantasy onto past experiences that create this FTM narrative? I haven't ever explicitly thought I was a boy trapped in a girl's body until recently. But even now, I don't feel super suffocated or whatever. I just feel like I would RATHER be a boy, but if I HAD to be a girl, I would be okay. (Sorry for the repetitiveness, I'm a bit jumbled atm). Am I trans? Will this pass? I don't want it to, but will it? Is this normal? Am I just creating this? Please help.

tl;dr

288,2018-07-28 19:28:27,92oqel,7,2,Hi everyone guess I'll try and keep this short. I'm a 28 year old male who has just recently started to explore my sexuality I guess. I'm in a hard place atm I broke up with my gf of 3 years more than a year and a half ago. Prior to that I have had one sexual encounter with a transgender woman which didn't involve oral just receiving head. I felt a lot of guilt and shame for what I did and when my girlfriend at the time broke up with me I literally had a breakdown over the span of a year. Two suicide attempts one of which I actually died for a few minutes. High anxiety and a cocktail of medications. I've always considered myself straight and I am genuinely interested in woman but also am attracted to feminine transgender woman as well. I have never been one to judge other's be it sexuality religion or skin colour. I came on this site to see if anyone has been in a similar situation at all? And if anyone has some advice on the matter? I recently met a girl that I really like and I hope I haven't stuffed thing's up. I'm a overthinker and my own worst critic self esteem is really low and I find myself doing things I wouldn't normally do such as looking for transgender escorts online. In saying that I haven't done that in the past before ever. And I don't condone the industry at all. I've tried multiple times to quit pornography as I feel it's subjecting to all woman transgender or not. I feel low down highly anxious and depressed. I would just like to get better and try to find someone who is understanding and non judgemental. I fear that if I told this to the girl I like she'll think I'm a freak in some way. Guess I also worry about what other's think more than what I do of myself.

My partner is MtF (no surgery), I am cis AFAB.
For the first year of our relationship we could have sex, she would occasionally have dysphoria really bad and we would stop but for the most part she would be more into it than i was (i consider myself a strange grey area of asexual, also have a health issue that causes me extreme pain during sex) and i felt awful. My lack of sex drive due to my issues used to be a huge problem to her, to the extent that it almost caused us big problems.
We got over those issues and were doing well for a while;
but now, we haven't been able to have sex in weeks because she hasn't been able to keep herself into it, which i more than understand in my own ways so i dont hold it against her or hate her for it...im just curious as to if other trans folk have experienced this.
She can masturbate with no problem, she even watches straight cis porn to do so, but when it comes to actual SEX she can't handle it anymore.
Is this something a lot of trans folk struggle with?
I've discussed already with her and she assures me it isn't me, that she still 100% is in love with and attracted to me. She initiates half of the time and we still have to stop because even when she REALLY wants it, she can't do it.
We are thinking it could be her hormones (she recently started progesterone and is about to hit her 2 year mark for estrogen and t blockers).
Regardless, is there anything anyone can recommend that I could try to maybe make things easier for, or better for her? She isn't good at communicating and when i ask her that i always get ""i dont know"" so honestly, i'm asking because BOTH of us would like suggestions.
Things we could try, things that might have helped others who have experienced this, etc.
*
I know everyone is different but any suggestions, or even fellow trans folk reassuring her in the comments that this is a completely normal thing would be appreciated.

I feel kinds way out of my comfort zone but I\'m curious.\nMy partner is MtF (no surgery), I am cis AFAB.\nFor the first year of our relationship we could have sex, she would occasionally have dysphoria really bad and we would stop but for the most part she would be more into it than i was (i consider myself a strange grey area of asexual, also have a health issue that causes me extreme pain during sex) and i felt awful. My lack of sex drive due to my issues used to be a huge problem to her, to the extent that it almost caused us big problems.\nWe got over those issues and were doing well for a while;\nbut now, we haven\'t been able to have sex in weeks because she hasn\'t been able to keep herself into it, which i more than understand in my own ways so i dont hold it against her or hate her for it...im just curious as to if other trans folk have experienced this.\nShe can masturbate with no problem, she even watches straight cis porn to do so, but when it comes to actual SEX she can\'t handle it anymore.\nIs this something a lot of trans folk struggle with?\nI\'ve discussed already with her and she assures me it isn\'t me, that she still 100% is in love with and attracted to me. She initiates half of the time and we still have to stop because even when she REALLY wants it, she can\'t do it.\nWe are thinking it could be her hormones (she recently started progesterone and is about to hit her 2 year mark for estrogen and t blockers).\nRegardless, is there anything anyone can recommend that I could try to maybe make things easier for, or better for her? She isn\'t good at communicating and when i ask her that i always get ""i dont know"" so honestly, i\'m asking because BOTH of us would like suggestions.\nThings we could try, things that might have helped others who have experienced this, etc.\n*\nI know everyone is different but any suggestions, or even fellow trans folk reassuring her in the comments that this is a completely normal thing would be appreciated.

So this week I was on vacation from work and heading down to visit my Mom and head to the coast for the week.  I headed down to her place, and I noticed right away she seemed like she was confrontational right off the bat.

In the past she has been really supportive and invited me out as my new self a few different times,  never once did she say anything about any doubts/issues with my transition.

I brought some liquor (shes always had a drinking issue/hobby) she got kinda lit and was asking about my recent name change that I got done in court.  I updated my name and gender (Fuck yessss!) Ive been out everywhere for over a year now, and everyone uses my new name except her and my dad :(

She was upset and I told her its all so I can get my new ID. I have to still go get my social security and birth certificate updated.  That was the point she lost her stuff.  Started yelling about how I never thought about her in this whole process, and how could I want to update my birth certificate, that is totally wrong, because that is not who I am.

I'm 15 years old and am assigned female at birth, and have been identifying with female for my whole life. However, the past months have been causing me some confusion. I guess it all started when I cut all my hair off. I cut my hair purely because I hated having hair, hated how it felt on me, hated how I looked with it, just hated myself in general. So around April I buzzed it down do about an inch or so. Being young and uneducated, my little sisters immediately started calling me ""boy"" as a joke. I thought I would have felt odd being called a boy, but it wasn't at all. I felt happier than I ever did after cutting my hair, and I never once cared when told I looked like a boy. I don't dress stereatypically feminine, I don't wear makeup, I can't stand skirts and only wear dresses to fancy events (which I rarely go to).

10,2018-07-03 23:18:28,8vwtld,5,6,"AMAB, with gynecomastia. I sometimes feels like a boy and sometimes feels like a girl. 


Like when I was a kid, I got bored and said to my mum ""mum, today I want to be a girl!"" My mum would give me some of her clothes, and then I would play like a girl. 


Later I sometimes also took my mum's clothes myself without asking her. But at puberty I found when I wore her clothes thinking I was a beautiful girl I got erections. I knew girls don't have erections and was confused and afraid. I was scared that my mum would find out. If she found out, what would she say to me?! I could not imagine. Probably she would see me as a pervert? It seemed to me that if I wanted to be a girl, I could not have my male part, and otherwise I could not be a girl. So I stopped playing the ""mum, today I want to be a girl"" game. 


I feel it's like losing some great fun, kind of a regret, but I do not have dysphoria and I'm OK with being a guy. Each time I want to play the ""mum today I want to be a girl"" game, I would go online search for sex-change information. It could be fantasy, practical information, or porn. I have learnt a lot and am still gaining more and more knowledge about sex change. Besides, I will fantasise that I have a flat crotch and a vagina, and was being taken care of, dominated, loved and penetrated by a tall and muscular guy. Or I was playing scissoring with a girl. Just by fantasising and playing with my boobs (remember, I have gynecomastia) I could achieve multiple small orgasms. Like sudden electricity flows from the tip of my penis, only lasting 1 second, but could come many times in a row. I don't even need to touch my penis. It's far less intense than a full blown male orgasm, but it still feels really good.  


I used to have a room mate. I think I was in love with him and he was also in love with me. We use to do a lot things together and before we slept we used to talk with each until one of us felt into sleep. We even took showers together sometime, and he used to comment on my boobs and nipples. Like ""Wow, they are so big!"" In front of him, I think I exhibited my feminine side a lot more than usual. We kind of accepted each other the way we were. We didn't need to hide. But I couldn't physically get closer to him. I felt if I were a girl I would definitely want to have sex with him. I felt if I were to have sex with him, I was gonna offer him a vagina not a penis or anus. So we never had sex. 


Sometimes when I read success stories of post-op woman, or seeing their post-op bodies, not only the vagina folds, but also boobs, curvy hips and smooth skin, I am a bit jealous, because I couldn't have those. I am also jealous of those who have female voices. I've tried some ""voice therapy"" to sound more like a girl, so that it feels more real when I want to be a girl. My effort has not been successful. But anyway, I am happy for those transwomen, for they've got what they've been wanting so much. I think in the future if sex-change could be reversible, then I would definitely give it a try.  


For the rest of the time, I am just a guy. It's like 80% of the time I feel like a guy and 20% of the time I wish I were a girl. I had a girlfriend. When having sex, I was totally OK with being a guy. When I felt like being a girl, we would watch post-op transwoman porn and I would imagine I was the post-op transwoman. It's like they are my proxy, living a fantasy of mine. My ex-gf was fine with it and would sometimes tease me of being a girl. We broke up for other reasons.


I think that's my story. I used to have another account with a lot of down votes from those mtf people. It turned out that those mtf people didn't think I qualified to be one of them.

But all of these things suit me! I am an afab transmale but I also am not binary trans as I'm very gender non-conforming (femboy). So technically all 3 flags can fit me. But that's too difficult to use, hold, or create one with all 3! I thought about using one as an umbrella for the others but then I wasn't sure if trans is the umbrella for NB and genderqueer or if NB or genderqueer works as an umbrella for trans? (It could work wither way yeah?) I don't know how to just choose one I simply like as I like things they all represent.\n\nSo, which one do I use for me?

34,2018-07-09 00:45:52,8x6dns,6,6,"One thing I've been thinking about a lot recently is the relative focus put on mind vs. body in transgender circles, including both binary and nonbinary-centered ones.

I've always been someone focused more on the mind than the body. I'm a very emotional person, and I tend to experience life in terms of feelings a lot, and I also tend to be a pretty abstract thinker. I've always had an active imagination, and from an early age, I've read a lot, played a lot of make-believe games, made up lots of stories in my head, and things like that.

One thing I feel weird about is the large degree to which discussion of trans issues, both from trans people themselves, and from the broader society (who often discuss us in not-the-most-respectful ways) is the way discussion of transgender experience seems to focus on the body, almost exclusively, and neglect or ignore the mind.

I've always felt like my body isn't really that important to me. It's like, it's there, I live in it, and I want to take good care of it, but I've never felt like it defines me or is the most important aspect of who I am, or even anything close to it. When I think of the stuff most central to who I am, I think about things like my values, my ways of thinking, my knowledge, wisdom, my feelings, intuition, beliefs, impressions of things...all this stuff.

And so when I think about gender...the most important aspects of my gender have all been these things relating to my mind, and the body stuff seems less important, and primarily important insofar as it relates to the mental stuff. For example, social interaction, how i think about and relate to others, and how others interact with me, is central to my gender identity and experience of gender, both the positive aspects of it and the points of tension or struggle. And my body has only really been important to the degree to which it shapes these things, and even there...it doesn't feel like it's the thing that really matters to me.

I don't know if this is making much sense?

Like here are some thoughts I've been having about this topic:

* For me, the focus on the mind and drawing the focus away from the body feels like it makes me feel more comfortable in my identity as a trans person. When I separate the two, I feel more comfortable having a body that doesn't match my gender identiity. The intense focus on the body, both from the broader society, and in some trans communities, tends to make me feel worse: more dysphoria, more depression, more doubting of my identity. Focusing more on the mind makes me feel more confident in my identity and more comfortable with myself.
* The lack of discussion of mental and emotional facets of transgender experience I think has made it hard for me to get help navigating life situations. For example, one of the hardest things for me in life has been dating, especially, navigating the earlier stages of dating, and I often have found very few resources available that seem to address some of the struggles I have.
* I often just feel weird and alone when I think about this stuff. I'm like, are there people out there whose experiences of gender are so abstract, cerebral, and emotionally intense like mine? Yet not focused on the body?

So I'm someone who has always strongly questioned the legitimacy of the gender binary (at least from high school onward), but I've lived my whole life as a cis girl, and will probably continue to do so, with my cis guy partner. We're talking about having a kid soon, and as I look into parenting and pregnancy stuff, I'm finding all the binary-ness to be pretty overwhelming. Like, I'm really not looking forward to everyone asking me ""what I'm having"" and if I'm going to do a ""gender reveal."" And then when the kid is born, all the gendered gifts and comments (though I'm sure they would come from a good place).

I've been thinking a lot about how I want to approach the subject of gender if I get pregnant, and there are some things I'm pretty sure about, but other things where I'm totally clueless.

I'm sure I don't want to find out the ""gender"" before giving birth. I'm sure I want to choose a gender-neutral name. I'm sure I want to choose toys from princess to Power Ranger and everything in between.

But then there are those things like clothing and pronouns that would probably have to be binary, if nothing else because I couldn't handle the constant judgment, and it might actually make life unnecessarily difficult for my kid if I veer from the norm.

Obviously, the gender binary will be learned by my child no matter what I do, because they'll see and learn it everywhere they go. I just want to make sure I don't put my kid in a box, that I live at least somewhat true to my belief that the gender binary is bullshit, but also that I don't make life any harder for them by setting them up for bullying and judgment.

I would really appreciate hearing any thoughts on this from y'all. Have you seen any successful or unsuccessful examples of this? Is it ridiculous that I'm even thinking about it?

And then when the kid is born, all the gendered gifts and comments (though I\'m sure they would come from a good place).\n\nI\'ve been thinking a lot about how I want to approach the subject of gender if I get pregnant, and there are some things I\'m pretty sure about, but other things where I\'m totally clueless.\n\nI\'m sure I don\'t want to find out the ""gender"" before giving birth. I\'m sure I want to choose a gender-neutral name. I\'m sure I want to choose toys from princess to Power Ranger and everything in between.\n\nBut then there are those things like clothing and pronouns that would probably have to be binary, if nothing else because I couldn\'t handle the constant judgment, and it might actually make life unnecessarily difficult for my kid if I veer from the norm.\n\nObviously, the gender binary will be learned by my child no matter what I do, because they\'ll see and learn it everywhere they go. I just want to make sure I don\'t put my kid in a box, that I live at least somewhat true to my belief that the gender binary is bullshit, but also that I don\'t make life any harder for them by setting them up for bullying and judgment.\n\nI would really appreciate hearing any thoughts on this from y\'all. Have you seen any successful or unsuccessful examples of this? Is it ridiculous that I\'m even thinking about it?

39,2018-07-09 18:19:58,8xegpv,0,1,"tl;dr: I am a counselor working at a group home trying to be out as genderqueer/pansexual to simultaneously provide a queer staff to help questioning youth and an example to humanize queer folk and promote tolerance in our organization. Help! (skip to the end for my questions)

So, I work as a lead residential counselor with adjudicated male youth. I like to jokingly call it glorified, really complicated babysitting, but essentially it's a group home with 14-18 boys, ages 13-18. My job is to basically guide them through their daily schedule and help them to learn life/coping skills in-the-moment as situations arise. Additionally, since I'm a lead counselor at my place of work I am personally in charge of 5 boys and work with them closely one-on-one in learning skills and completing goals to get them back on track in their lives.   


We recently have had a resurgence of a lot of racial and homo/transphobic talk coming from the group (it kind of fluctuates in waves at my facility). I put together a ""diversity group"" at my work that will help to educate them on the differences between us, ranging from gender/sexuality to culture to things like economic class issues. 

Personally, I identify as genderqueer (/nonbinary around people who might balk at ""queer"") and pansexual, so my first focus was on trying to spread some factual information about sexuality and gender to them. We have a human sexuality group, but that is largely focused on topics such as birth control and consent etc. and doesn't really go into depth on anything outside cultural norms. We also do not really have any queer staff working (we're rather rural but luckily have a range of religious/cultural/political backgrounds at least). After a lengthy discussion with my boss who runs the facility, we decided that it would be useful to ""come out"" to them as a way of providing a queer support at my facility for youth that may be questioning and as an opportunity to teach tolerance and help humanize queer folk to boys whose only real exposure to them has been from misguided rhetoric from their families, schools, and peers. This was entirely my idea, and I went to my supervisor for feedback on whether it could be something helpful or if it would just provide too much conflict in my workplace etc. as well as how to go about it if I did. The idea was to essentially introduce it as an example when we got to nonbinary/genderqueer discussion in the diversity group and integrate it into the discussion.   


Well, I had the group on gender/sexuality last Saturday and it went even worse than I expected. :D I set firm expectations that they could communicate that they had issues with the concepts being discussed, and even provide why they don't agree with things, but it had to be done in a respectful way. I wanted there to be discussion and conversation. The point of the diversity group was to inform and to show that we can respect one another even if we can't agree with or accept certain things. However, I essentially ended up cancelling the group before we could really even get past the basics of what sex/gender/sexuality really mean due to a lot of really negative and trans/homophobic statements pretty much right out of the gate. Rather than support that kind of disrespectful communication, I told them we would try again at a future date. 

I segued that into a discussion about why this was such a touchy subject for them, and why they had such knee-jerk impulsive reactions to the topic. It actually was a pretty good discussion, and out of that one of the big points of contention with them was that they would not be talking that way if there was a ""gay person"" in the room. They also had a lot of comments about people outside of cis/heteronormativity being ""weird."" I saw that as a good opportunity and shared with them that I was nonbinary/pansexual, which was something that simply hadn't been relevant at my work before, but I was sharing now because it was important for them to understand that you can't know how people identify by just looking at them, and that disrespectful/hateful comments didn't have a place even in private conversations because you simply don't know when you might be hurting someone or alienating someone who might identify as whatever it is you're making fun of. I also reinforced with them that more and more people are coming out as queer in some form or another and will continue to do so, so it was valuable to understand more about them and practice tolerance.   


Talk about a mic drop. :D The response was exactly what I was hoping for, and everyone remained respectful after that. We didn't go into more discussion about the concepts then (I told them if they wanted to find out what nonbinary and pansexual meant they'd have to come to the next group :P), and wrapped up with expectations for how future groups would go. Coincidentally, that group was at the tail end of my shift and I was leaving to go on my weekend, so it gave them two days to consider how the group went etc. On my way out luckily nobody treated me any differently and all were friendly as they wished me a good weekend and such. Time will tell if issues start to arise. 

One positive out of the group already is that one youth came to me afterwards and said that when I introduced our topic for the day his stomach dropped because he was pansexual and had been on the receiving end of a lot of bullying over it. I was able to extend an open invitation to talk about gender/sexuality issues whenever he felt like he needed to and he seemed grateful. 

Which brings me to why I'm actually posting this here today. I am very confident in my work and my ability to navigate this issue with the boys (if I wasn't, I wouldn't have even approached the subject), but this is really the first time I've been out in the general public.

Overcome resistance from boys that have ingrained prejudices in wanting to work with me?

51,2018-07-11 12:59:33,8xzcpg,12,38,"CW: Talk of dysphoria and body image issues.

So hey. I'm an AMAB nonbinary and the way that manifests in me is a really strong feeling of not liking being explicitly gendered either way. To use an example my desired androgyny is kind of an 80s style Annie Lennox/David Bowie gender ambiguity that aims for presentation that sits in the middle of masc and femme, specifically as opposed to the mixing of explicitly gendered signifiers from multiple genders. In many ways the idea of being seen as a ""Man in a dress"" is kinda internally horrifying to me, and the butch lesbian aesthetic is something that I can feel a lot more at ease with.

That strong aversion to being explicitly gendered extends to my body and while I've contemplated it, I really don't think I'm a good candidate for HRT. There are too many things about my body as it is that I wouldn't want to change that HRT would impact in addition to the things it would help.

So my problem I'm having at the moment: My face. It's mannish. And I kinda hate that to the point where it's impacting my ability to be happy in day to day life. My weight has yo-yo'd a lot over the last few years for a variety of reasons.

I\'m an AMAB nonbinary and the way that manifests in me is a really strong feeling of not liking being explicitly gendered either way. To use an example my desired androgyny is kind of an 80s style Annie Lennox/David Bowie gender ambiguity that aims for presentation that sits in the middle of masc and femme, specifically as opposed to the mixing of explicitly gendered signifiers from multiple genders. In many ways the idea of being seen as a ""Man in a dress"" is kinda internally horrifying to me, and the butch lesbian aesthetic is something that I can feel a lot more at ease with.\n\nThat strong aversion to being explicitly gendered extends to my body and while I\'ve contemplated it, I really don\'t think I\'m a good candidate for HRT. There are too many things about my body as it is that I wouldn\'t want to change that HRT would impact in addition to the things it would help.\n\nSo my problem I\'m having at the moment: My face. It\'s mannish. And I kinda hate that to the point where it\'s impacting my ability to be happy in day to day life. My weight has yo-yo\'d a lot over the last few years for a variety of reasons.

I'm afab and kind of in a mess with gender questioning right now. I've identified as a butch lesbian for a while now, and since figuring out my butchness I felt for a while that I was a gender conconforming cis woman. 

Lately I've been reading a LOT about non binary and now I'm sort of unsure. I definitely get dysphoria. I changed my feminine birthname to an androgynous name years ago. My breasts don't feel like they belong to me, I eradicated my period with science, I can't deal with wearing dresses. I would love to be flat chested, more muscular (I work out, but progress is slow), maybe have more body hair, be a bit gruffer in general. I don't identify as male at all, but I love getting mistaken for a guy and I think I would be fine with he pronouns, though she ones don't bother me. 'They' is okay but (to me) feels more wishy washy and doesn't really sound right, though feels natural to refer to friends of mine who use them.

Most of that sounds very genderqueer on paper. But it feels like an almost a choice on if I point to myself and go 'look, a woman can be anything', or say I'm now not actually woman or am something else alongside woman. It feels political whichever way, too. 

Calling myself trans feels like stepping on the stories of those with more a defined transition. Though I have some of the same experiences... dysphoria, deadnaming, would consider top surgery. But maybe I just have those experiences as a cis person. I mean, I do recognise like you can be trans without feeling any of that too. 

It's just weird to break down gender this much. It's not your presentation, your pronouns, your social experience. People say it's an internal thing, but that just feels like calling however I feel about all this a gender.

I'm afab, and bigender¬†(at least, I'm pretty sure). Half the time I love my body (minus the extra weight), and the other half of the time I completely hate it and am very discomforted by it.¬†

When I am female, I love doing my hair, makeup and wearing dresses. I love my pronouns and name. My body gives me very little discomfort.

When I am Male I hate my body and face. I Feel very detached from it. Pronouns dont bother me much outside of my home, though¬†on Male days I love when my husband uses my Male name and pronouns. But it doesnt bother me much if not used when out.

I'm exploring my identity and now that I've accepted my Male self, I feel happy, exhilarated, and downright terrified.

My issue is that I dont know if I should come out. My husband is aware of my exploring and seems to be supportive. I'm an adult with my own family. My husbands family are very catholic and not understanding whatsoever to the lgbt community. My family is very conservative religious people. Again, not convenient¬†for a gender non conforming person. Additionally, I have kids that I dont want to confuse or¬†scare. I dont want them bullied for me being who I am. And honestly, even when I am a guy, I love being mommy. I never want that to change.

For now I am good being my Male self inside my home mostly when the kids are asleep or not home. I do wear my husbands clothes alot both inside the home and out in public and this doesnt bother them as I've always done¬†this. I have binded my chest and recently packed in front of them, but they didnt seem to notice, as I guess in some way I've always tried flattening my chest. And truthfully, they just weren't looking at my lower area and asking about it. Currently, I am not comfortable wearing my beard and using my Male name and pronouns around my kids family or friends. But the urge to go out in public as my Male self is strong. When I'm Male, I have to have a beard. It's the only way I feel remotely close to who I am. I spend a lot of tedious time applying a fake beard to wear around my house a few hours a day while my kids are at school. I havent been able to do this as its summer, and I'm feeling lost lately. The feeling of needing to have my beard is becoming almost unbearable at times.

My questions....Should I just come out and deal with all the hate, questions, confusion and problems? Should I just be my Male self at home? Should I try going somewhere away from home to be Male in public? What was it like your first time going out???

Also, my hair is straight and halfway down my back. if I choose not to come out but cut¬†my hair short (shaved pixie), will this out me regardless??? Should i cut my hair? I keep going back and forth. I feel like I really want to and then my anxiety and fear creeps back In.¬†If i cant even cut my hair how am i going to get through the biggest stuff??? Should I start by slowly wearing more mens clothes (meaning i start buying my own vs. Wearing my husbands) until I'm comfortable wearing them out and people dont even notice??? People dont notice now as I frequently go out in his tshirts and basketball shorts. But I want to get my own mens Jean's, flannels, boots, button ups. But I'm afraid cutting my hair and beginning to wear my own mens clothes will completely out me if I¬†dont come out.

'Im sorry for the long¬†post. My thoughts are currently jumbled.

My personality is a diverse spectrum - a continuum. There are many versions of me: some of them male, some female, some beyond the binary. Together they form a unified Gestalt - the self, ""me,"" and that ""me"" is not cis.

But for the most part, I still look and dress like a boy. 

I was AMAB, I have very distinctively ""masculine"" features, and I feel most comfortable in just casual jeans/t-shirt attire.

I like wearing makeup, my gender performance is across the spectrum and my behavior is absolutely fluid, but when I'm out in public I don't usually wear anything more than foundation/lip gloss (if that) and I never wear dresses (my feminine aspect is more ""soft butch"" anyway. Dresses don't really appeal to her.)

It's not that I don't want to go out in more non-conforming fashion with a full face of makeup, it's just my anxiety gets the better of me. I have pretty bad PTSD (I'm a trauma survivor) and in a way ""boy drag"" acts as a sort of safety blanket and defense mechanism in public.

I'm not questioning my identity, or my authenticity. I know gender identity and presentation are seperate things. I'm not cis. I know this. I feel this deeply. I have the monthly bouts of dysphoria to boot.

I recently moved to a new area, and - as fate would have it - also recently started questioning my gender identity.

Since I need to find a new doctor *anyway,* I decided to pick a new doctor from a list of referrals from a local transgender services group.  You know... just in case.  I haven't made any concrete decisions about transition, yet, but I see nothing wrong with putting all the correct pieces in place, in the meantime.

In the interest of openness with my doctor, I think I'd like to be up-front, and share the open question of my gender during our first appointment.  I may even like to discuss HRT with her.

The thing is, I'm *not* 'out.'  And I haven't 'decided' to transition.  I still present very male.  I'm not even sure what I'd like to transition 'into' - I figure I can stop as soon as I find a balance I'm comfortable with.  If that means full transition, so be it.  If not, also fine.  I'm just trying to find the real 'me.'  I suspect I'm a bit fluid in this regard, as my feelings pendulum back and forth with each new day.

So my questions for this sub are:

1.  Do I have to be 'sure' that I want to transition, to be allowed a prescription for HRT?  What if I'm hoping for HRT to shed some light on my doubts and questions?  I'd prefer to have an honest relationship with my Dr., but I'd hate to find out that they refuse HRT for people who might 'change their mind' later.

2.  Do you have to 'present' female, for Drs to prescribe hormones?  Do i have to go in and ask for female pronouns, and use a female name?  I'm not ready for any of that.  I don't feel comfortable with it, because I don't 'feel' female yet.  Part of my interest in HRT, is finding out if it can help with that regard; sort of a chicken/egg situation.

3.  Do doctors consider non-binary or androgynous appearances as valid desires or end-goal, for MTF HRT?  Do they condone SERMs in conjuction with E2, for instance, to hinder breast growth and sort of 'customize' the feminization areas?

I‚Äôm 14. I was assigned male at birth. I have a girlfriend who was previously ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù before she realized I was also interested in her. When I started to open up about my gender, she also started questioning and now is probably also fluid. 

So a few nights ago I was a girl most definitely.

20,2018-07-05 11:11:32,8w9m2d,2,9,"Why hello there lovelies,  Elizabeth here, 

So guess I'm just going to give alittle update on where I am at currently.

Apologies for not being so active :)

Here's some points:

\*My partner accepts me any way I am, always good to have that

\* I'm being alot more open and expressive with my gender identity (making more comments about how I am feeling and such)

\*I've realized that I am more confident and more social when I stop hiding my identity from myself 

\*I've contemplated on coming out to my family

\*I've come to terms with myself when it comes to my gender identity and I'm now more comfortable with myself 

I spent an hour in front of my mirror one morning and basically had a talk with myself really loud (No doubt if someone was awake, they heard). I told myself everything negative someone could tell me if I came out to them and I was able to formulate a response or explanation to it.  I then gave myself a ""pep talk"" and began crying to myself once I said these words. 

""You only want the people you love to understand what it's like to live in your head. To see the world and your body the way you see it. They would understand, without explanation, what you've gone through for so long. You only desire to be free and happy, whether you're a boy, girl, neither or somewhere in between. You'll never know how you will feel tomorrow, but at least you can identify it when you feel it, that's more then you could do a year ago.  Just look at yourself over the past few days, you're able to look at yourself in the mirror and say confidently that you love yourself, and that you think you're beautiful. You thought you could never see yourself as beautiful, but now that you have began to accept who you are, you're able to love yourself more then ever. You need to stop lying to yourself. Stop being a coward and be honest with yourself, at least yourself. How can someone else accept you if you cannot accept yourself? Stop lying to yourself. You deserve to love yourself, and that's non-debatable.  You're going to take these three weeks to find yourself and love yourself, then you're coming out. That's that.""

So yes, I've made a commitment to my inner coach that I will come out of the gender- closet in three weeks. With all of this exploration and personal acceptance, I am still worried about my families reaction. 

Can anyone give me advice on how to come out to my family?

It would be appreciated.

Or do you think I should even come out? 

Please give me all the responses :)

31,2018-07-08 19:02:01,8x3sq7,2,21,"SO and I have been together for almost ten years. In getting to know her early on she knew that I CD but not the history of how I came about to do it.

She was never supportive of it, and maybe hid her disgust of it from me. I was still able to CD, but had to hide it from her.

Over the last year I‚Äôve been more interested in exploring that side of me beyond just CDing. I‚Äôve started dressing out, but still subtle enough that few people can tell. I‚Äôve also opted to stop getting a haircut.

Coming out to her was a result of her nagging me to get a haircut, but I asked her why it was so important to her that I got one. Her response was that ‚Äúwomen grow their hair long. Do you want to be a woman?‚Äù To which I responded, ‚Äúthe length of one‚Äôs hair doesn‚Äôt determine their gender,‚Äù and ‚Äúno, I have no interest in being a woman, but I want to look like what I want to look like.‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt like this answer as she implied that I wanted to go full-time CD, and then questioned my sexuality.

I reminded her that who I am attracted to (women) sexually has no bearing as to how I want to look. I love being in ‚Äúguy‚Äù mode, but sometimes I like to feel that part of myself in ‚Äúgirl‚Äùmode.

She then remarked that I‚Äôve become ‚Äúobsessive‚Äù. I asked her to clarify. She told me that she tolerated that I liked to wear lingerie and began wearing them no matter what mode I‚Äôm in, but that I liked to dress as the gender I felt like bordered on obsessive (and therefore implied that I had a problem). 

Again, I disagreed. I said that I see nothing wrong in being who I want to be.  I‚Äôm still the same person, in pants or a skirt. I said she was the one with the hang up as she felt that if a man‚Äôs outward appearance resembles a woman he must want to be one (and vice verse). She said if she wanted to be with a woman, she would be an L.

I then said to her that she should see the person I am inside and realize that I am, and always will be, the same person. If she cannot accept that this is part of who I am then we should not be together.

Her response was that ‚Äúyou want it to be over so you can continue to live this way.‚Äù

So in essence, I feel that she is not open to understanding what it means to be gender fluid. I really would like her to understand, as I love her. 

What kind of resources would you recommend to help those on the outside looking in?

54,2018-07-13 01:06:41,8yfjtk,15,29," If I had to answer the question of whether I was a man or a woman, I would have to say both.

Yes, I was born into a male body, but my soul has two genders.

I am one person with two halves: a male half and a female half.

Although I was raised as a man, I believe my female half was always there. It just took me awhile to discover that. But once I did, it was impossible to ignore. When you spend your entire life only able to express one of your two genders, you get used to it. I still largely act male and dress male, which doesn't mean that my female half isn't there, it just means that most of the time her gender is something that remains buried deep within me, but every now and then, it'll be her turn to physically express herself the way she wants to while my male half takes the backseat. Her turns are much shorter than my male half's turns, but that's because it's more convenient to live as my birth gender. So although I can give my male half more control over my appearance, it doesn't mean that my female half doesn't exist, or that I can pretend it doesn't.

My male half has a morality based on tradition. My female half has a morality based on instinct. My male half is religious. My female half is spiritual. My male half is an extrovert. My female half is an introvert. My male half is a thinker. My female half is a feeler. My male half is a writer. My female half, a painter and a musician, the source of the raw artistic images and emotions that my male half organizes in his stories. Which is not to say that my male half is entirely devoid of emotion, or that my female half is entirely devoid of thought. The thoughts of my female half are more straightforward, the thoughts of my male half more complex. The emotions of my male half are subtle like a candle, the emotions of my female half are passionate like a campfire. One half is structure; the other is flow and flexibility. What I'm trying to say here is that I need both. If I killed one half and kept the other, I wouldn't be me anymore. Even if you've only seen me when I'm presenting as a male, you've still probably seen my female half in action.

This afternoon, I was feeling incredibly gender dysphoric. I got nauseous when I looked in the mirror. I hated the clothes I was wearing. I lay down on my bed paralyzed with the feeling, on the verge of tears just doing nothing for hours besides trying to chase the feeling away. So I did something that I'd never done before: I tried to have a conversation in my head between the two halves. I closed my eyes, meditated, and tried to split my consciousness into two halves, which was difficult. But as I felt myself dissolving, I could feel the two halves forming in the two sides of my body and the two sides of my brain. I could see him on the left, sitting amidst stacks of books, and her on the left, wearing a white dress and dancing in a field of flowers. I could see their history together. How when they were children, he was the mischievous trickster while she was exuberant and affectionate; then as teenagers, she became vulnerable and confused, and he protected her until she grew self-assured again.

I visualized them sitting together at a table in a restaurant. She's upset and he asks her what's wrong.

""I don't mind being cooped up in here,"" she says, referring to the subconscious that surrounds them, ""But I deserve to be able to dress up and feel pretty every once in a while.""

""You will,"" he replies, ""Just wait a day or two and then it'll be the weekend and we can crossdress with friends. You know we're saving our good dress for then, and even if we weren't, you know we can't wear a dress while our parents are in the house.""

She starts sobbing and puts her head down on the table and doesn't stop. It feels good to get all that emotion out. Concerned for her, he tries to think of ways to comfort her.

""Here, eat something, you'll feel better,"" he says, passing her a small piece of steak on a fork from his plate. She eats it and starts to calm down. ""What can we do to help you relax and make you feel better? We could take a bubble bath, eat some desserts... maybe we can't dress up until the weekend, but I'm sure we can compromise and find something that will cheer you up in the meantime. Does that sound good?""

""Yeah,"" she says, drying away her tears, ""But on one condition. I want to shave off all our facial hair. And I want to put on makeup... not too much, but just a little. I don't need to feel like a woman entirely, but I want to feel a little more feminine, even if it's just a little, just so I don't feel so ugly and trapped. Then we can go downstairs and have a healthy snack. Something better than steak.""

""Ok, then, it's a deal,"" he says.

It wasn't a particularly long conversation, but afterwards, I got up with more clarity as to what was going on inside me and what I could do about it. I shaved, put on makeup, then went downstairs and ate a peach, and then I felt much better. So I guess this is a good strategy for dealing with this kind of conflict in the future.

I guess it's a good time to share my story. Let's go deep. I'm AMAB (assigned male at birth). I started crossdressing at home when I was 15 years old -- my sister was off to college and had left some unwanted clothes behind. So whenever my parents were out of the house I'd sneak into her room and try on her things. I had no explanation for my behavior and felt terribly guilty about it, because I was raised in an Evangelical Conservative Christian family. I felt like God was watching and was seeing an abomination. I was so ashamed and I did everything I could to keep it absolutely secret.

My first exposure to transgender people was through 4chan. There were regular t\*\*p (cencored because it's a slur) threads on /b/. It was a very unhealthy community of chasers, revenge porn, and cyberbullying. BAD. I remember feeling confused and guilty. I wasn't sure whether I was attracted to t\*\*ps or jealous, I was afraid of being gay, I felt like what I was doing was wrong, and I kept lurking these threads for unexplained reasons. I was into ""fap roulettes,"" which are essentially a game that commands you to crossdress or masturbate anally or whatever. It was the only way I could give myself permission to experiment.

When I went to college I began questioning my religion, became an atheist and then an agnostic. I was so afraid of losing my family that I didn't tell them about my loss of faith. They would always ask if I had found a church and I'd say I was still looking, until eventually it became obvious I wasn't. In the meantime I rebuilt my morals from the ground up. I realized my gay roommate wasn't an abomination and neither was I, but I never let go of my shame. I had classified my ""issue"" as a sex fetish. The first person I confided in was an ex-girlfriend I thought was a friend. I told her I was shaving my legs and asked her to teach me some things. We later had a falling out and she threatened to call my parents and out me, tell them I was gay, and mix truths with untruths to make it worse. She didn't follow through on her threat but I felt so betrayed, hurt, and vulnerable that I purged. I gathered the few pieces of female clothing I had, mascara and waxing kit, and threw them in a dumpster. I cleared my internet history and regrew my leg hair. I made sure there was no evidence and I trusted nobody with my secret for five years.

Let\'s go deep. I\'m AMAB (assigned male at birth). I started crossdressing at home when I was 15 years old -- my sister was off to college and had left some unwanted clothes behind. So whenever my parents were out of the house I\'d sneak into her room and try on her things. I had no explanation for my behavior and felt terribly guilty about it, because I was raised in an Evangelical Conservative Christian family. I felt like God was watching and was seeing an abomination. I was so ashamed and I did everything I could to keep it absolutely secret.\n\nMy first exposure to transgender people was through 4chan. There were regular t\\*\\*p (cencored because it\'s a slur) threads on /b/. It was a very unhealthy community of chasers, revenge porn, and cyberbullying. BAD. I remember feeling confused and guilty. I wasn\'t sure whether I was attracted to t\\*\\*ps or jealous, I was afraid of being gay, I felt like what I was doing was wrong, and I kept lurking these threads for unexplained reasons. I was into ""fap roulettes,"" which are essentially a game that commands you to crossdress or masturbate anally or whatever. It was the only way I could give myself permission to experiment.\n\nWhen I went to college I began questioning my religion, became an atheist and then an agnostic. I was so afraid of losing my family that I didn\'t tell them about my loss of faith. They would always ask if I had found a church and I\'d say I was still looking, until eventually it became obvious I wasn\'t. In the meantime I rebuilt my morals from the ground up. I realized my gay roommate wasn\'t an abomination and neither was I, but I never let go of my shame. I had classified my ""issue"" as a sex fetish. The first person I confided in was an ex-girlfriend I thought was a friend. I told her I was shaving my legs and asked her to teach me some things. We later had a falling out and she threatened to call my parents and out me, tell them I was gay, and mix truths with untruths to make it worse. She didn\'t follow through on her threat but I felt so betrayed, hurt, and vulnerable that I purged. I gathered the few pieces of female clothing I had, mascara and waxing kit, and threw them in a dumpster. I cleared my internet history and regrew my leg hair. I made sure there was no evidence and I trusted nobody with my secret for five years.\n\nI went into software engineering. About a year into my job, a person sharing my office came out as trans.

63,2018-07-13 21:21:12,8ynwni,11,4,"Hey everyone.   
I would like to start of to tell you all something about myself.

I'm 32 year old male cis hetero, I'm basically as vanilla as can get. I'm a social worker and have been for 10 years. I'm also a socialist and very much believe in accepting everyone, even if you don't understand jack about it.

That said, I've always been interested in everything that I don't understand, that doesn't mean I get to understand everything, but I want to try as much as possible anyway.

About a year ago I found out my sister is trans, shock sure, but I'm truly happy she told us and now lives as a woman. Her happiness is a million times more important than the confused feelings I had when I found out. That said there was 100&amp;#37; acceptance from the get go.

Anyhoo, started to pay even more attention to everything about gender (like most, I grew up with the idea that sex and gender were the same), and I heard about genderfluid. While I can understand transgender for the most part, I mean not how it must have felt, but the idea that their gender doesn't match completely with the biological body they were born with, is understandable.

Genderfluid however I don't get, so I want to ask you all some questions and I hope it helps me understand you all a little better. :) PS I realize most of this can be found on the web, but I rather have some human interaction, especially since a lot of it is personal anyway.

If some of my oversimplification feels offense, know that none of that is my intention.  


\- How does genderfluid feel in your day to day life. I mean we got women who can dress up all in 'typical' female clothing with make up and everything, or put on some jeans, t shirt, put her hair up and I guess got a bit of a 'typical' male attitude of throwing something easy together. Where does genderfluid kick in that makes the experience so different?

\- Is different clothing that we as a society deem male or female, be a requirement to address how you feel that day? Or could you say I throw on a skirt everyday and I don't give a rats ass what people think (regardless of a biological male or female body as well)

\- Does it bother you if someone calls you he or she because depending on your biological body, you look more like 1 then the other? Do you correct them? Do you then prefer he/she, or they?

\- If he/she bothers you and prefer to use they, why exactly? They in language is of course use to address multiple people, so I'm always confused why that word is use (I get the wish for a neutral word, I just don't get why this one is used), and why does he/she bother you? I get to a certain degree (I don't mean that in a dismissive way, but really in a way that I don't understand many parts of it) that it may not fit your gender feeling at that moment, but it's history of course stems from biology, got a penis and you are a he, got a vagina you got a she. For me it's hard to understand that while I fully accept ones gender and personality, I would be considered offensive if I were to say she to someone who has a biological female body and also leaves it at that (or is that something that most change?). So basically I would be saying she to her gender, but to her biology. And while I get that I wouldn't do this to a trans person, and therefor it seems hypocritical, but there I have the feeling that biology didn't do it's job completely right, and when they go into transition it's also easier - and yes again I realize that this is not a good reason, but hopefully you are getting my point.

\- How fluid is your gender, I read some about having certain days, but is it something you wake up with, or does it change through the course of a day. Does something trigger it?

\- How is the experience for biological women to be pregnant? I know transmen have major issues with this, causing a lot of gender dysphoria?

\- How are relationships with straight people? I mean physically I'm only interested in the 'female' body, so say I were to meet a great person who has a female body, but their gender would change, I don't think that would bother me, but then again I have no clue.

\- What changes for you from day to day, from clothing to personality traits to emotions etc?

\- What are the biggest misunderstandings people have?

I became more familiar with the concept of gender and gender identity and started wondering if I was transgender. I realised that my gender identity was really variable, I sometimes felt like a girl and sometimes like a boy. During my 'boy' moments, I felt really connected to the stories of transsexual people as, just like some of them, I felt like my body didn't represent who I really was and I would have much rather wanted to have a male body.

I visited my best friend over the last 2 weeks, traveling 500miles up north to meet her face to face for the first time (we only had online contact before). And while there, i finally felt like i could, y'know, let loose a bit. Wear something other than shirts and pants, maybe. Try to be a bit more feminine, at least around my friend because i know i can trust her not to make it awkward...

.... aaand i ended up buying dresses and tights and panties with her, wearing them pretty much constantly, swapping clothes (we got the same dress size); i even found out what my general style is (slightly gothy punk, apparently) and the entire time -and i mean the ENTIRE TIME- i was there, not a single person looked at me funny or laughed or even made so much as a disagreeing noise. In fact, every single person i came into direct contact with either treated me perfectly normal or actually complimented my look. And i got a ton of nods and smiles on the street as well, which is still baffling me to no end. People called me *cute*, both to my face and behind my back. Nobody called me cute before, ever. People just accepted me without a second thought.

I don't think i ever felt so *alive* and *happy* in my entire life as i did in those last 14 days. And i am determined to not let this slide away from me. I am out now. Officially.

87,2018-07-20 21:53:10,90k5ud,1,1,"Hi,

About a year ago I first had the thought that I was gender fluid, which was fine by me.  I find myself fantasizing about being a girl, but have no dysphoria, and I actually love my body and face.  I have no problem with acting and being referred to as a man, but female pronouns and fantasies get me excited. Now I recently realized I have autogynephelia (arousal at the thought of having a woman's body. Negative connotations aside, this is just the term that describes me best) and I'm freaking out that I might actually be trans.  

The only reason this is freaking me out is because so many sources say that autogynepheliacs are often just late onset trans people, I've yet to find a gender fluid autogynepheliac.  I'm worried I will develop euphoria later in life and then regret not transitioning when I can actually ""pass"". So it's like a ticking timer and I'm already 22.  I almost feel like it would be easier if I just knew for sure that I was trans because then there would be no question of what to do.  

Also transitioning would prevent me from accomplishing lifestyle goals that I can't accomplish if I was a girl.  Like I prefer to have a male singing voice (even though I know hrt doesn't change voice, but I would be embarrassed with my voice as a girl).  

I would feel so much better to hear that another gender fluid person has autogynephelia, like just knowing its a ""combination"" that happens to people.  I feel like gender fluid could apply to me, but most people talk about how one day they're a man and one day they're a woman.  For me it's the same, but the switch happens like every 3 hours.

He said he needs flirting and girliness and got stressed and frustrated and didn't know how to deal. I know he needs this. I know I'm not a great supply of flirting and girliness. (I'm working on fulfilling these needs but it's like learning a new role and new set of lines and is bigger effort than I think he realizes when I'm not feeling very femme.) I told him as much, and asked him if he thinks he made the wrong choice in marrying me. He said he knows what he married and doesn't expect this from me and that he loves me for who I am.

*Great, way to respect that, bud.* /s

**Here is how I wish this went down:**

I wish he would have talked to me about this before getting on dating apps. This cowardly piece of shit (damn husband rn not dear husband, forgive my budding anger) didn't tell me when this happened or speak up about any of the angst that led to it, and I'm not sure if he would have ever come clean.

I want his needs fulfilled just as I don't want to be someone I'm not. I go out dressed as Hot Babe with him but I'm still...me. I think having an outside source of this flirtation is absolutely something I want to explore for us.**\*\*** I brought it up to him before, that he needs to find an outlet for it and maybe he should loop in some other women. 

I'm really Not Cool with *fucking* without talking to me about it first but am more than chill on the extramarital fucking given safety parameters, open communication, and of course reciprocal permission on my end to experiment and fool around.

Anyway, this post is getting really long so I'll wrap it up. Most of the time I feel really great about my life as a genderfluid person but this dug up a lot of old insecurities that have long been at rest (Hello, old friends! How have you been?) and I'm just disgusted right now at the scales that have newly fallen from my eyes.

When I'm\xa0feeling Male, I want to overhaul my entire wardrobe, cut my hair way short (which is currently halfway down my back) start T asap so I can grow a beard, and lower my voice. The intensity to be Male is overwhelming. My swings arent small swings. I'm either completely female, or completely Male. I have no clue how to navigate this and am not out to anyone except my husband who is completely supportive in me exploring myself and who I am.\xa0\n\nHow to I navigate this??? Do I cut my hair in Hope's I like it as both??? I've already bought boxers and getting ready to buy a packer and binder but will mostly be using these only at home.\n\nDoes anyone have any any suggestions???\xa0\n\nThanks!"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Extreme gender swings', 'created': 1532496809.0}"

I'm just a typical guy. Muscular build and I like being a guy, doing normal ""guy"" things. 
But there's a major part of me that loves femininity. And lately it's been depressing me more that I don't act on it. 
I have a unhealthy obsession with nailpolish, heels, and makeup in particular. 
I will often look at a woman when I'm out and I think either she is beautiful, or I wish I could be her.
But my issue is Im ok with being a man. But I'd also love to be a woman. 
I like having Male genitals but sometimes I wish I had female ones. 

Over the years I've wondered if I'm just into crossdesssing. Because I loved shaving my legs and painting my nails watching romance movies in langerie and my exs sweatpants and shirt while playing with my really long hair and fake nails. But I feel its more than that. I sometimes just don't feel like a man. I feel different. I feel like the woman I described not just a man wearing girls things.

So I question if I'm non binary. Or maybe I'm finally letting go of the denial. I've known I loved certain things for a while. But only once my now ex girlfriend helped me feel it's ok to be myself I really started to explore it with her.

My current wife isn't supportive of this. She is only ok with me doing my toenails. 
Even painting my toenails makes me feel drastically better about myself. Especially if I shave my legs.

Honestly writing this and just getting it off my chest feels good. I'm 28yo. And I've held this in forever. I've only accepted this part of myself since I was 22 and that's when I started to explore it. But I still feel so lost.

And any feedback or suggestions from anyone who may understand and know what may help me or what I am would be great. Is this normal? I feel most people want one or the other. They know they are a woman or a man or a crossdress or non binary etc. But im stuck and confused. But now I'm wondering if maybe this is what genderfluid is.

I've always been kind of uncomfortable with them, but I could never understand why. I feel that they're informal and I'm uncomfortable with using them for myself.

So I'm 20 now. I bound my chest from when I was 13 to when I was 18. I bound my chest every day for eight hours a day, sometimes more. At the time I didn't regret it, and I never thought I would. I was 100% convinced I was 100% a boy, and nothing could change my mind.

Now I'm 20 and a lot has changed. I'm currently identifying as a girl (for the most part) and let me tell you I regret binding my chest at such a young age. My breasts sag a LOT. Like they're the breasts of an elderly woman who's had a few kids in her younger years. And it gives me so much dysphoria in a way I never thought I'd have it.

I never knew that binding my chest from such a young age could mess me up. All the stuff I'd read on binding was written by young adults/ older teens, so there was no warning about the extreme consequences of binding and the impact it would have on my body.

I'm scared to talk about this because I'm afraid people will think I'm trying to tell people to not bind. That's not the case at all. I simply just want people to know that binding can really really give you permanent consequences later down the line, especially if you're young. I now will have to save up for some kind of reconstructive surgery at some point to have normal breasts.

I still didn't feel comfortable with coming out to them yet,(They know I am Bi) so when she asked me why, I came up with some bullsh*t answer. 

They have been pretty good calling me Jac for the past couple weeks but when my dad left the table today to go walk our dog, My grandma started asking me why. So I said something about how I didn't like my assigned name because I knew alot of people from both schools by that name who have all been jerks.

So, when I first found out about the whole ‚Äòtransgender‚Äô thing, a couple of years ago, I heavily identified with the whole idea of genderfluidity, and was pretty happy with that label, but over time I started kind of identifying differently. I identified as nonbinary for a year or so, then I began to identify as masculine. I‚Äôve been identifying as masculine for several years, chose out a name for myself and everything (I‚Äôve been going by Jeremy for about 2 years now). 
But recently, I‚Äôve been identifying with genderfluidity more, which is cool and all, and I‚Äôm okay with that, but I‚Äôve been a little confused. I wanna identify as more masculine, and just kinda generally be seen as more masc, even on feminine days. I still get dysphoria about my body quite a lot, even though I‚Äôm quite happy presenting as feminine, if that makes sense? I feel as if I‚Äôd be happier if I was AMAB. My gender fluctuates a lot, but overall I‚Äôd prefer to be seen as masculine. I get happy when people I don‚Äôt know use he/him pronouns for me, or refer to me as male. It upsets me when I‚Äôm seen as female, for the most part. It doesn‚Äôt bother me as much on feminine days, but it still kinda bothers me, unless it‚Äôs people I‚Äôm actually close with. I was just wondering if anyone else had experienced something similar because it‚Äôs rather stressful and making me feel like. Super invalid?? Idk haha if anyone‚Äôs got advice or input hmu
I‚Äôve also been wanting to change my name to something more gender neutral. I dislike my birth name, and I don‚Äôt think my chosen name quite fits me anymore. I‚Äôve been going by Castiel for a while now to close friends and people online, but I allow people close to me to call me Winnie on feminine or more androgynous days.

131,2018-07-31 05:33:12,93bqmd,1,13,"Hello everyone! 

I want to start this post by saying that I am not an expert but I do know my fair share about being genderfluid. (Also I am on mobile so forgive me for formatting errors) Also, there is some mention of sexual organs but I don't know if this classifies as NSFW

So now that I have that out of the way let's start!

So let's start with a definition:

&gt;*Genderfluid* : A gender identity in which the person gender fluctuates on a spectrum, usually between being male, female, Bigender or agender.

TLDR: sometimes you identify as male, female, both or neither.

*What are someways to know if you are genderfluid?*

1) Sometimes you wish you had the opposite sexes genitals but not all the time. This could mean want boobs and a vagina instead of a penis or vica versa or sometimes you want a penis and boobs.

2) You like to crossdress. Example: (AMAB [Assigned male at birth]) who likes to dress up in dress or female clothes.

3) sometimes you feel like the opposite gender.

4) You like things that are typically for the opposite gender only. Though you could just like that stuff so this one is kind of on the edge.
 Example: AMAB likes lip gloss, high heels, dresses

5) You identify as genderfluid. No one can tell you what to identify as. You get to choose. As I said I am not an expert.

Now, if you figured out your gender identity. then great! I will now give some bonus tip of what not to do.

1) go and make short videos with this joke

&gt;""So what is in your pants""
""(enterJokeHere)""

Usually the answer is something like death. Now I am not saying that this never happens (I know from personal experience it does) it is just over used.

2) COME OUT IF YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH YOURSELF. I know from personal experience that it is not good to come out if you are not ready. It is over whelming and you will regret your desiscion and go start questioning yourself. 

3) Introduce yourself by saying

&gt; hi my name is (enterNameHere) and I am genderdluid.

This will make people think you are making it up to get attention.

Now some things to definitely do!

1) If you are comfortable with yourself, then get yourself some clothes of the opposit gender. You don't have to wear them in public but on nights when you are feeling dysphoric put on the clothes and you will feel better.

Example: AMAB: get a dress, bra (that fits) and a t shirt

AFAB: get some male t-shirts and male jeans.

2)  Get comfortable with yourself before you come out.

I hope this has helped someone as that is my goal!
