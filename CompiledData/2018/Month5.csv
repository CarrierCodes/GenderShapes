I always thought that I was never even close to ‘passing’ as male due to the 38FF chesticles I have, and my hourglass shape. It’s something I’m learning to cope with for now while I’m losing weight (30lbs down yay!) since it’s way easier to be androgynous when you reduce that pesky sex-determined fat distribution. 


Anyway - I thought anyone with eyes would clock me as a butch woman, and I’ve never even considered NOT using the women’s restrooms. I’ve used them my whole life. 


Last night my boyfriend and I went to the cinema (he’s a total peach who is supportive of my gender exploration) and I just popped into the ladies before we went in. When I came out of the cubicle to wash my hands, an older woman came out of a cubicle and just openly stared at me, jaw agape. I made eye contact with her and smiled, and she just gave me a silent look of utter horror. She left without washing her hands (gross).


I live in the UK which hasn’t had the same debate about bathroom use for trans individuals that the US has had, so it’s not on people’s minds at all. I don’t blame her for her reaction (apart from not washing your hands, that’s icky) but now I’m left thinking - what bathroom am I welcome to use? This is something I’d genuinely never worried about. I always thought the stories of people being too afraid to use gendered bathrooms were paranoid. But what I got last night was a very mild reaction, but I am so shook - I made a woman flee the bathroom, she didn’t even say anything to me and nothing happened afterwards.

10,2018-05-01 22:32:36,8gcj5c,5,10,"Hi everyone. First i need to say that i dont know where to post this, so i tried to find something that is related. I am 21 born female, i live in germany. Ever since i can remember (and i remember EVERYTHING from my childhood) i never felt like i belong to ""women"", but not to men either. I felt detached, as if all this weird sex bullshit was useless and annoying. I also tend more to the ""male side"" of my family - i love art and maths like my grandpa and i love science (and art) like my father. I even LOOK 100% like my father (dark hair and eyes, the only thing from my mother is that my hair are straight). 

I feel kind of fine in my body, my boobs are small and since i am quite ugly i also dont fit into the beauty standard of women (yes it CAN be an advantage to be ugly lol). I usually wear mens tshirts bc they are more comfortable and my hair is pretty short. Optically i am good, i like how i look and dont intend to change it much. 

Theres one thing that bothers me though - reproduction and the theoretical ability to be pregnant. I am lucky that i hate children and dont want any (and that i am lesbian) because what i want more than anything is a sterilisation. Just THINKING about what is inside me makes me fucking cringe, i want to rip it out or shove something in my stomach that kills every fucking cell related to.... You know those things. I hate it. So i try to get a sterilisation. I could have asked fot a hysterectomy but i seriously dont want to hit early menopause, so i choose a sterilisation. I found a doctor and he was extremely supportive (quote: ""try to get your insurance to cover it, they have to it needs to be done!""). Issue: i am insured privately with my parents and there is NO WAY they wont know.


This is where my issue starts: my relationship with my parents isnt really bad but they lost all trust i had in them a long time ago since they never took me seriously. I always knew i NEVER wanted to marry (lesbian, gay marriage was illegal until last year i think) and that i dont want children. If i was ""lucky"" i got laughed at, if not i was ignored and yelled at to ""not talk shit and what do i even know"". They never cared much for these things (i also always wanted to move to southern europe like spain, france or italy... Guess what - they made fun of me) and i the only thing i remember is their laugh. It was my greatest fear as a child: being laughed at for my future plans.

My best friend (who is extremely supportive mostly and who does everything for me if i need help) now intervened bc my parents NEED to know my issue, so he told them. Not behind my back dont worry, but i wasnt present bc i was so scared. Since that i am really freaked out. My mom reacted almost positive (she said i will get the surgery so thats at least something) and my father idk. But the thing is, i dont trust her. AT ALL. I locked myself into my room and didnt leave since then (im in my room since yesterday). My friend even said that her reaction was ""yes i remember she said sth like that as a child but i didnt take it seriously"" - yeaaah... I figured that already. 

My friend now brought me some food in my room bc obvsly i didnt eat today. I am still pretty freaked out and i basically jusz wanted something to eat to shut up my stomach, nothing fancy like a pizza or some shit so i just told him to bring cereal. He did, but kind of thought its a good idea to make fun of me once again as in ""i would have brought you pizza but no you now want cereal and lock yourself up, typical way girls solve problems right there *HAHAHA LOOK AT ME IM SO FUNNY WOMEN ARE DUMB AND SO ARE YOU*""... Did i say he was supportive...? I just waited for ""are you on your period?"" (Im not btw, if i was he wouldnt have entered my home aka dragon cave during that week...)

Anyways now i changed from disturbed to pretty pissed and threw him out.. And now i just feel empty... I just want to never open that door and never see a living person who can make fun of me and laugh at me ever again...

My babysitter at the time told me I had to wear a shirt, even though it was over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and I remember being crushed. I think it was the first time I realized that being assigned as a girl meant that my life would go in a different path from my friends. 

The next time I remember really rankling against my gender was in high school. I knew I was bi or gay, although I wasn't sure which (still am not), but I was co-president of my school's GSA and doing research online at the time and stumbling across the idea of genderqueer. I immediately latched onto it and did a test drive of coming out while I was at debate camp over the summer between freshman and sophomore year (summer of 2005). It went poorly because teenagers are cruel, so I buried those feelings until college. I went by my assigned name (feminine), my middle name (ambiguous gender) and Vincent on and off over the years depending on the group I was interacting with. I eventually landed on just going by my feminine name because it was easier.

For the next several years I kind of put it aside because gender identity took a major back seat to the fact that I had some other mental health and trauma that needed to be processed before I could deal with those questions. But then I got help, and my brain had the capacity to start thinking about gender again.

Now when I'm in spaces and I have to identify my pronouns and I use she/her/hers sometimes I feel neutral about it, and other times I feel physically wrong as the words come out of my mouth. I was listening to a friend who is trans the other night about new pronouns, and she mentioned ve/ver/vis and those felt immediately right to me in a way I can't articulate. I feel like I need to start reexamining my gender for my own mental health, and nonbinary with non they/them/theirs pronouns just feels right.

I am very overweight and my body has extremely predominant, even overdeveloped feminine characteristics. I want to start exploring different gender expressions but feel very constrained by my body. And yes, I have tried losing weight but I just don't have a good metabolism and losing a lot of weight would come at the expense of my health. 

I mostly just wanted to get this out there in the world and maybe feel less alone? I would also love tips on how AFAB folks with large breasts and hips have started to explore different gender expressions and the experiences people have had with nontraditional pronouns in English. Thanks!

Someone responded with a remark that his parents love meat more than they love their son.

Someone else responded that it isn't about the love of meat, it is fear of what other people will think about their son being vegan, that the father might feel ""emasculated"" for others to see that his son is a vegan.

And then, someone wrote this below:

Looking for some advice on what to do. My partner is a queer cis man and I'm an AFAB nonbinary person. Some days I feel very happy presenting femme and feel very little dysphoria. Other days I feel incredibly dysphoric and feel best presenting more masc. 


I came out as enby, cut my hair a lot shorter, started using they/them pronouns, etc. around october (we had been dating about 2.5/3 months at that point), and we have talked before about how that has impacted my partner's attraction to me sometimes but how he still loves me and wants to be dating me.

Today when my partner came home and noticed I was packing, he got visibly distant and texted me later saying ""I just can't always be affectionate when you're presenting masc""

Has anyone had any similar experience handling this while in a relationship? I really adore my partner and I understand this isn't necessarily what he's most attracted to, but it also hurts a ton when he says stuff like that and I'm not sure how to approach it.

TW for gender dysphoria, internalized transphobia



I came out as NB and pansexual about 1 year into my marriage. Despite coming to a realization about my identity and orientation, I love my partner (AFAB) and we seem compatible sexually. But in the last year or so, I've had increased issues with decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction. I still feel strong attraction to my partner, and I get excited during foreplay, but penetration now stresses me out. Each instance of low performance increases my anxiety.

I'm comfortable with oral sex or pleasuring my partner with a toy or my fingers, but they say it's just not the same. They are more satisfied by penetration.

I experience dysphoria with my penis on occasion. It's more of a tool to me than a part of my body. If I transitioned I'm not sure I'd miss it, but it's familiar and I know how it works. Or I thought I did.

I think I have a lot of internalized toxic masculinity from my decades trying to pass as cis male. I'm seeing a therapist, and trying to work through these issues.

My partner is very supportive and never makes me feel impotent or ashamed, but I know it hurts them. We used to have incredible sex, and I love them entirely, so this has been incredibly frustrating for both of us.

I recently had some testosterone injections, which I've been iffy about in the past because I thought they'd stifle my femme side. Turns out I had low hormones across the board. The shots helped me feel more energetic and my sex drive increased, but I'm still having anxiety over the actual penetration, and finding myself getting soft minutes after getting aroused in foreplay.

We've experimented with pegging (them topping me, which I enjoyed but didn't climax) and as I mentioned, I really enjoy performing cunnilingus and fingering, to the point that I get a dopamine release similar to orgasm (I call em drygasms), but I have a hard time climaxing if my partner isn't fully enjoying themselves. I can't use a partner in a selfish way. I'm too aware of how hurtful that is. 

 I honestly sometimes hate depending on my penis so much. It feels transphobic and shitty to not feel like we're having sex if there's no vaginal insertion. If it would just do what I want, then my partner and I could get past this.

Our marriage is great. We've been together 6 years. We communicate, we are emotionally intimate and honest, we enjoy each others company.

So what gives? I'm willing to try pretty much anything at this point. I just got prescribed some ED drug treatment that my doctors believe will help me get my sexual confidence back, so we'll see how that goes, I guess.

I'm worried my condition could be something that won't get better. 

My partner is a schoolteacher and their job has become a source of constant stress for both of us.

I'm transitioning careers and have been going to school (hard at my age, but I inherited a windfall from my Dad so we had the financial security to go single income).

So maybe it's just stress. I have an anxiety disorder, my partner has clinical depression. Needless to say, as a leftist, feminist, NB couple this current presidential administration is a source of much fear and stress, so none of that is helping.

The thing that sucks the most is how this affects my partner's self esteem and their own dysphoria. And I constantly worry that we somehow are going to become less and less compatible even though we deeply care for each other.

Final note: I go soft when masturbating too, but can usually get it back. I think this is because I'm alone and don't get embarrassed or anxious. I almost never watch porn since I came out. (haven't found a lot that caters to my orientation or preferences that isn't horribly transphobic or sexist). Watched a lot in my teens and early 20s, but cut way back once in a committed relationship.

What a mess.

I’ve been realizing for awhile that I want to dress more androgynously because I don’t like that everyone who meets me instantly puts me right into the cishet guy box, since I’m nonbinary and I consider myself a somewhat feminine gay guy. I don’t know where to start. 

Here’s my problem- I’m disabled. I have quadriparesis (incomplete loss of function in all 4 limbs), so I have little leg, trunk, and hand strength. Now, I mostly wear loose-ish jeans or shorts and t shirts. I also wear sneakers exclusively because I wear clunky leg braces that require roomy shoes. It’s not impossible for me to wear anything else, it’s just that it’s what I’ve been wearing for years. When I first became a quad it was all I could wear but I’ve been learning how to do buttons and stuff. I just haven’t bothered. I’ve just kept buying and wearing t shirts and loose pants out of habit and being overwhelmed by the other options. 

What kind of shirts would look more androgynous? I know t shirts already do, but I sort of want to elevate my appearance more and want to wear more button shirts and polos. What colors and fits? What about pants? I want to look more elevated and put-together, because as a visibly disabled person with a fairly severe impairment I feel like I’m underestimated.

A few years ago, I started exploring transgender identities, and initially came upon the term ""demigirl."" I later came to find that this term didn't fit me so much, and I opted for, simply, female, but for the time that I had identified as a demigirl, I loved it. There was something about it that made me feel free, as though I were breaking not only biological boundaries, but also binary ones.
Identifying as female, while it is certainly a wonderful feeling, almost feels ever-so-slightly wrong, in some way, despite my 100% female expression and usage of she/her pronouns, feminine name, yada yada yada... I just feel as though there's a tiny bit of me that misses that feeling coming from identifying as NB. Yet, at the same time, I'm fine with identifying as female.
Let's put it this way: I am perfectly okay with identifying as female with all my main friends and my family. I prefer she/her pronouns over anything else, I love my feminine name, and I present 100% feminine. At the same time, I love that odd sense of freedom gained from identifying as NB, and would like to express an NB identity to, at the very least, online LGBTQ+ friends.
I'm worried that this might not really be a yearn to identify as NB, though, and that it might be a sort of ""transtrender"" scenario. That I'm really just yearning for identifying as NB to feel ""cool"" and ""different,"" especially because I talk to NB people and admire them. This worry is accentuated by the fact that I don't outwardly seem to be NB at all, because of my apparent gear toward female identity. I just wanted to know if it would be harmful in any way to identify as NB given the circumstances, if it really could just be a transtrender-like thing. And, if I were to ID as NB, what gender would I even apply as? Given that I'm so inherently female-seeming, is there really any point?
TL;DR I like the feeling of IDing as NB, but I'm worried it might be a ""transtrender"" sort of thing due to how feminine I present + usage of she/her pronouns + not really minding female identity.

I've found myself having thoughts like ""it would be really cool to try and look female and see if I could pass"", or ""I wish I could be male and female at the same time"", or ""I feel uncomfortable when I look too masculine, but proud when I look androgynous"". 

However, there's aspects of a queer male identity that I don't want to let go of. I like being able to hang out as ""one of the guys"", and I like being gay for males. I'm also afraid to lose that sort of privilege, since I already have my experiences invalidated oftentimes just existing as an autistic gay guy.

 I don't really mind terms like ""dude"" or ""guy"" at all, and I'm fine with he/him pronouns. However, I hate having chest hair and I don't really feel like a ""man"" (tho the exclamatory form like ""hey, man"" is fine). I also greatly prefer the androgynous form of my name ('Jackie') to the masculine form ('Jack'). When I was a kid, it would particularly infuriate me to be called ""Jack"" - it sounded too rugged and serious, as opposed to the softer, more playful and more mischievous ""Jackie"". 

If it were totally up to me, I'd call myself a nonbinary boy quite openly. I would claim both those identities with no issue. But not only do I have to navigate the cis world, I also have to navigate a queer world where nb identity is often defined in opposition to binary genders.

I identify as non-binary and genderfluid. Right now I feel trans masculine. I’m 20 years old AFAB, pronoun indifferent. I feel like I should also mention I’ve been independent from my parents since I was 17, although I’ve always had a decent relationship with my mom.

I’ve been hinting about my identity on Facebook and my super conservative transphobic bigoted grandmother is really the only one who seemed to notice. 
Since today was Mother’s Day I had plans to take my mom to brunch. I’ve been meaning to come out to her but my family is super religious and anti LGBTQ+  so I didn’t plan on doing it today. I also need to tell my mom I’m not religious anymore but I’m more scared of that then telling her I’m NB. I wanted her to have a nice Mother’s Day, due to my grandma that didn’t happen.
My mom called her to say happy mother’s  day and apparently my grandma said a bunch of stuff about me, not sure exactly what but I’m sure it wasn’t nice. 
Well when my mom picked me up one of the very first things she said was, “You look very masculine today” I really really doubt she meant it as a compliment, it felt like an accusation.  I was so anxious when she asked that I hardly remember what I responded. I made a sarcastic comment like oh is God mad at me now?? (Basically what my grandma is saying) she said no but there was so much tension. A bit latter in the car it got brought up again and she was saying how she thought it was too complicated and people can dress however they want without complicating it and that, “It’s simple, there are boys, and there are girls.” I stoped her right there and went off about how that’s not true even just talking about sex not gender, there are intersex people.  I told her that sex is different than gender. I told her I am non-binary and that makes me transgender. I was confident when I told her and made sure to use real science and statistics. She was intimidated by the science and facts I was using because she couldn’t argue against it. She didn’t want to say anything to offend me but was clearly upset and thinks I’m wrong. I tried to get her to say something but it was too confusing for her and she doesn’t know anything about the LGBTQ+ community. She said she didn’t want to offend me. She’s the type of Christian who pretends we don’t exist and that gay or trans is a bad word. She’s not hateful (unlike my grandma) but it’s like she sees it as a disease and wants to stay away to keep herself clean. 
My mom loves me and I know I broke her heart today. The past few years we have been extremely close minus me hiding this from her and I feel like that’s over now. I have no hope for changing her mind on this matter especially since I’m no longer Christian nothing I say really holds weight anymore if that makes sense.  I do want to try and educate her though so she knows what I’m talking about. She doesn’t even know the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation all LGBTQ+ people are the same to her. I would love to find a Christian friendly resource to send her with some info on non-binary and transgender people. Or just any advice in general on how I can explain it to her. I have an anxiety disorder so talking to her in person about this is really difficult for me.

I've elected not to tell my parents because they're narrow-minded people who wouldn't get it, trust me.\n\nWell, my boyfriend started referring to me at his parents' home with they/them pronouns and his mom finally asked what was up with it. He told her that's up for me to disclose, not him.\n\nI wasn't ready to really come out to anyone beyond some friends. I'm not ready to have to explain my identity and possibly be perceived negatively for it. I'm visiting his family tomorrow, so I'm sure this will come up. I just feel weird about it.\n\nI guess what I'm seeking here are some positive vibes for a nerve-wracking moment I'm sure will come tomorrow.

151,2018-05-15 16:53:47,8jn4tx,2,19,"Hey everyone, it's now possible to change your CA birth certificate gender marker by self-affidavit, including to nonbinary.

You don't need to wait until January, as some media have reported. I submitted my paperwork two months ago and just got back my new BC with “nonbinary” listed. I describe my process below. Feel free to ask me anything. 

The process requires a number of forms and other items. I go through the process I used below. The official instructions for this (and changing your name on the BC at the same time if applicable) are here (unfortunately named):  https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CHSI/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ADA_Sex%20Change%20(01-18).pdf

Basically, you mail the all of the following items to:
California Department of Public Health
Vital Records - M.S. 5103
P.O. Box 997410
Sacramento, CA 95899-7410

1. Form VS24:  https://www.cdph.ca.gov/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ControlledForms/VS24.pdf
You do not have to complete the last item (#12) per the instruction pdf above.  For a change to nonbinary, write out ""nonbinbary"" in the change field (not ""X"" or ""N"".). 

2. If changing the sex on your BC, include either a affidavit for the change or a certified court order of sex/gender change. For a change to nonbinary, you are most likely going to do an affidavit. They do not provide a form for this affidavit, but I used the template below.

3. If changing the name on your BC, include a certified court order of name change.  This must be an original and will not be returned.

4. Complete the following sworn statement, required to receive a certified copy of your new birth certificate:
https://www.cdph.ca.gov/CDPH%20Document%20Library/ControlledForms/VS111.pdf
You want to select ""certified authorized copy"" in  order to receive copies that will serve as identity documents.

5. Include check or money order payable to CDPH Vital Records: $23 for the change and first certified copy of the birth certificate; include and additional $25 for each additional certified copy that you want. 

6. A photocopy of your current BC, if you have it (NOT required).

But I've never let my mom see my facial hair, or even told her about it. I shave it whenever I go home (about twice a year). She has a lot of issues with my medical transition, and remains totally unprepared to deal with the concept. 

Back when I came out, she was very focused on ""making sure"" that I wasn't going ""all the way"" with my transition, and wouldn't ""become a guy."" It's clear that she thinks being nonbinary means not-transitioning-in-any-overt-way, no matter what I say, and she clings to that. She tried to get me to swear I would not grow facial hair (.... somehow, despite going on T. She's a nurse, so you would think she knows how hormones work, but no.) I declined to make that promise, but honestly, I also downplayed it a lot because she was freaking out. Eventually we hit a point where I had done my due diligence by explaining that yes, I am really actually trans and really actually transitioning and might one day be read as a (feminine) guy, and she decided to ignore that, and I gave her some time to process for the sake of family peace.

I was hoping that as time passed, she would chill out a bit and we could have a more calm conversation. But she hasn't. She's worked on my pronouns, which is good, but that's it. And it's just not sustainable to keep hiding my normal appearance from her. So I'm gearing up for The Conversation. But I'm afraid that she's going to accuse me of misleading her (by letting her live in denial) and/or just totally flip out all over again.

I went through something similar when I was 15/16 years old. But I didn't know anything about gender, so I never even really started to think properly about it. I started binding (with sports bras because I didn't have anything else), only wore things that are considered masculine, tried to be like my brother (my brother started watching youtube-&gt;shortly after I did as well, he learned skateboard-&gt;I as well wanted to learn that,he started playing computer games-&gt;I did the same; you see the pattern). I ""borrowed"" his clothes which resulted in ""stealing"" them haha
I felt really insecure about myself, felt lonely, a huge black hole inside of me but with school stress and  everything I just didn't even realise those  things. Looking back I feel like that might have been a little depression. 

After that I guess I tried to fit in, wore ""normal"" clothes, still not hyper feminine but not things that made people look at me twice, stopped binding, even went to end of school ball in a dress (i was 18 then)

Now I'm in quite a similar situation in which I was at the age of 15 (19 now). My ""chest dysphoria"" (not even sure it is dysphoria though) has gotten really bad, I even started binding with bandages although I know how bad they are. It was just the only thing that could make me feel a little bit better about myself and make me leave the house these days. also I cut my hair short (finally!!) which I had been wanting to do for the past 4 years but didn't dare to because of negative comments by my mum and hair dresser. 
I really started questioning my gender, got into all the non binary stuff and felt like that was something that might fit. and then obviously I also stumbled upon all the people saying non binary is made up, for special snow flakes, blabla, and all these doubts again made me doubt my identity a lot. I went from labels like agender to trans masc back to just a cis female tomboy. 
one important point I find difficult to talk about is that I experienced a very bad sexual experience. I wouldn't call it abuse yet but I was definitely not happy and really really drunk in that situation. 

I looked up reasons for gender dysphoria and found that sexual abuse is one of them. One thing is, I did bind before that experience, it just got a lot worse afterwards. Isn't it strange that my dysphoria gets worse with my depressive time periods? or are these bad times actually caused by dysphoria?

all that makes me doubt my identity. also I just don't care about pronouns, neutral pronouns don't exist in my mother tongue (or better: they are just really complicated) and they don't make me feel any different. quite recently I got called ""he"" a few rare times, which really made me happy, but ""she"" doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. 

I was high and I saw myself as a granddad for a second. my dysphoria was basically gone in that short moment. it just felt real. 
I got drunk and the opposite happened. every few minutes I had to go to the bathroom, desperately staring at the reflection of my feminine body, trying to hide my chest, in my drunkness pushing it around to make it look smaller (obviously not very effective haha).

Right now my dysphoria is bearable, I just wear baggy clothes and no bra at all and that already helps enough. also I'm comfortable with my name Hannah, although I also like Han which is usually seen as a male name or not connected to any gender at all (although it technically even is a name for everbody)
when I look back at old pictures I don't see myself, sometimesl I'm forced into wearing skirts, which makes me incredibly uncomfortable (usually I can avoid it, thank god) and when I see myself like that it feels like a costume, like a stranger is staring back at me. I feel like that might be my way of dealing with stuff, just seeing it as a costume, not a part of who I am?

In connection to sexuality, I'm bi/pan (depending on your definition of the words). when talking to cis men I often feel uncomfortable because I feel like I'm pushed into the traditional ""woman stereotype"" when talking to a person of any other gender I feel like I can just express who I am without these stupid gender roles that society pushes on us. 

Which makes me question, am I just a cis woman that hates gender roles? Or is there really something wrong with my gender. 

For the last months I've been writing down whether I would consider top surgery or going on testosterone and first I guess I had to get used to the thoughts, for top surgery the answer quite quickly changed to yes definitely, for t I was wondering if I really needed the effects. I guess I would be happier with a slightly deeper voice and maybe a different more masculine facial bone structure, I'm not too sure about facial hair though and feel like I could achieve the voice change with voice training as well. 

Also I'm unsure because of the ""I knew it all my life"" stories and that I was quite happy as a child. I did grow up in quite a gender neutral environment but even in the gendered things I did not feel uncomfortable. I did wear dresses as a child and only when puberty hit and I started growing up I didn't like these things anymore.

It's all just a mess. I can't see a psychotherapist right now because I live abroad for another 3 months and then move back to Germany, I've tried talking to a ton of different people online and it literally has confused me even more most of the time. I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I try to just live without thinking about it, just being myself, but my thoughts always come back to it. Someone just has to consider me a girl/woman and mention it and I'm thinking again. 

I don't even know why I'm writing you all this, maybe you still feel like answering, if not that's perfectly fine.

196,2018-05-20 03:59:44,8kqddw,13,7,"Hey all! 

Nice to meet you all. Thanks for having a rad subreddit with a rad community. I'm AMAB and ... maybe genderfluid? or transfemme? or enby? Or ... I don't know?

I've been struggling a lot for the past week to come to terms with how / who to refer to myself as and I was hoping some of the more experienced folk around here could help talk me through what the heck is happening.

Over the past several months, I've been doing a lot of good, hard mental work. I've broken through a lot of my longstanding depression and anxiety, and gotten a much stronger grip on my life. I've done this by finding and making peace with my internal critic, who lives in my head and judges me for not being like everyone else.

Unexpectely, this had gender-identity fallout for me last week. On my commute I started seeing trans themes in some of my favorite pieces of art -- and identifying with them -- and then, I asked myself a question that I'd asked many times and always stopped myself before answering: am I a man?

And the answer was: no. You're super not, dude.

Ever since then I can't wear most of my old clothes. My name still sounds fine. Parts of my body feel ... off (body hair, facial hair). I now vividly REMEMBER hating my genitals but I've also had 20 years since puberty to get used to them. 

I feel most comfortable referring to myself with she/her pronouns and talking in my upper register. However, when I slip into networking or dealing / discussion I find my voice dropping and feel masculinity settle into me. Which feels itchy. It passes after 20 minutes or so. 

I've found my fashion sense revert to 90s grunge -- the fashion of my adolescence. The first thing I did the day after I saw it was dye my hair purple and cut thumbholes in a thermal. I've remembered wishing I were Angela when I watched My So Called Life. Fortunately, her layering plaid and grunge gives me 

This does not change the fact that I am a goddam mess.

I've since started to see a therapist. I suspect, if being trans had been something i could consider in my teens without my brain shutting it down with depression/anxiety, I would have been a trans-woman. Now, though, I've spend so long socialized male that I've made peace with some of it.

Which almost makes things harder, because I sometimes feel it trying to erase the female or nb parts.

Him- ""I thought you decided that long ago.""

Me- ""No....? I was just thinking about it, but I didn't say anything, I was scared to.""

Him- ""I don't see why. Its nothing, it's like being gay.""

Me- ""Well... Its not nothing... But kinda supportive I guess...?""

Me- ""I haven't decided my pronouns yet, but you wouldnt use them much anyways since I'm not out""

Him- ""I probably wouldn't even if you were.""

Me- ""That's... Rude.""

It continues back and forth for a bit, him claiming that it's fine because it's only bad if you change a person's pronouns, not if you just refuse to use their chosen ones. Also he says he won't remember, so he wouldn't try.

I mean, he's the person I trust most in the world; it feels physically painful. If even he refuses to respect my gender then who would in this conservative farming town I'm stuck in??? I want to close this Pandora's box now plz.

I feel really awful, but maybe he's missing a piece of information here? 

His text when I texted him that what he said hurt:

""Ahh hmm, I’m not very articulate - my point is whatever happens or whatever you are you’re just my friend ____, which is what I was failing to say""

So he's not being snide, he just... Doesn't get it? Idk

I was active here for a while when I was questioning myself like crazy and eventually came to identify as non-binary.  Here, I felt like I had a community - a rare thing for me.  Last fall, though, I started to acknowledge my deep envy of cis male bodies and realize that I am a trans man.  It took me a while to accept that, and I was somewhat sad about stepping out of this community.  Being here gave me permission to be myself and to talk about things with people who could help and support me because they'd been through the same thing.  In the end, it turned out that myself is a (feminine, dapper, pansexual) man - but I don't think I ever would have discovered that or accepted it had I not first participated in this community and gotten to know myself better.

Thank you for being yourselves here, as much as you can.  You will always have an ally/brother in me.

I've started posting on my gender blog again, which has changed from Mx Lexicon to [Mr Lexicon](https://mrlexicon.tumblr.com/).  I plan to finish putting up the non-binary resources I've found on the Resources page there, and my past posts from when I identified as non-binary will stay up.  I hope you'll join me as I journey through this new chapter of gender exploration and eventually start transitioning.  I think I might start spending some time on this sub again just because it's a lovely community with a lot of very stylish people. c:

Also, as a final note, being non-binary is completely valid and wonderful.  Although some people, like me, end up identifying more with binary genders, non-binary people exist, and you all are living proof of that.

I was active here for a while when I was questioning myself like crazy and eventually came to identify as non-binary.  Here, I felt like I had a community - a rare thing for me.  Last fall, though, I started to acknowledge my deep envy of cis male bodies and realize that I am a trans man.  It took me a while to accept that, and I was somewhat sad about stepping out of this community.  Being here gave me permission to be myself and to talk about things with people who could help and support me because they'd been through the same thing.  In the end, it turned out that myself is a (feminine, dapper, pansexual) man - but I don't think I ever would have discovered that or accepted it had I not first participated in this community and gotten to know myself better.  \n\nSo, thank you.

When I am on a female swing, I'm all girl, love pretty stuff and wearing skirts, sparkly dangly earrings, etc. I love ""ladies cut"" shirts, girly colors and patterns, etc, and when I'm in full girl mode, even wearing ""unisex"" clothes is dysphoric. My girly side priority is my social presentation, being perceived as all girl. I really don't care what's under the clothes, as long as the outer presentation is all girl.

My guy side is still emerging as a social presentation (partly because a lack of budget keeps me from adding men's clothes to my wardrobe), but has a strong need to fully transition physically, and I've been on testosterone for nearly a year and loving the effects. While I adore the physical effects on my body, especially the muscle growth, and some of the changes are making it difficult to wear my feminine cut shirts. My arms and shoulders are bulking up very nicely and I love my new masc body, but if I go with a larger size ladies shirt to accommodate my musculature, it just hangs ugly on the rest of my body. I prefer closely fit (but not tight) clothing. As a large-breasted person (not for much longer!) I learned early that you buy a shirt to fit the largest size of your body, and alter the rest to fit, but I can't afford to get them all custom tailored, and I don't have the skills or equipment (sewing machine, etc) to do it myself.

I cannot afford to buy new clothes at this time. Not even Goodwill. 

*Note: by some miracle, my face hasn't been masculinized by testosterone, so I still look femme that way.

I have come to identify as non-binary, but as a married father, I face enormous pressure from my wife to present and act as a typical cis-male.

My dysphoria seems to come in waves, and the peaks can be weeks or even months apart, it seems, but last night, my wife gave me criticism for continuing to shave my legs in spite of the fact that I keep getting razor rash and ingrown hairs.  It's hard to blame her because I look like I have some disgusting skin disease on many days, but the honest truth is that I feel the compulsion to shave because I so strongly dislike my masculine body hair.

It's become an ongoing source of conflict between us.  She reminded me that when we got married, she married a man, not an enby.  In a way, it's really unfair to both of us that things turned out this way.  I feel like I'm trying to live more authentically, and she sees me as the man she loved turning into something she doesn't want to be with.  She said that if I had presented as enby from the beginning, she wouldn't have married me.

But frankly, *I* did not know that I was enby until recently.  But as I've said before, there are signs going back years that I diligently covered up and ignored.  Growing up, I was harshly criticised for my persona as it was and I was taught repeatedly by my sexist, narcissistic, misogynist, homophobic, transphobic father that *female is inferior* and he was raising me to be a *real man*.  It should come as a surprise to no one that I censored my own thoughts and feelings that it took well into my fourth decade of life to even allow myself to acknowledge what I feel inside.

I finally said to my wife around bedtime today, ""Non-binary is transgender.""  I can't remember everything I said, but I told her that I feel like I can't tell her the truth because **telling the truth hurts her**, and I can't keep secrets because **keeping secrets hurts her**, so I feel like **I'm doing wrong no matter what I say**.  I think we're going to have some more intensely uncomfortable talks in the coming days because I'm no longer willing to pretend to be something I'm not.

The thing that just drives me insane is that I feel like she is doing something to me whether she is even aware of it or not.  She is so terrified of this change that she is sending small, but very powerful signals to me that my enbiness is completely unacceptable, to the point that I feel like I'm stepping out of line when I insist on expressing myself.

229,2018-05-23 05:11:42,8lgtgn,2,9,"I made a post a few monrhs back explaining I didn't know how to express my enby-ness. After some supportive comments and suggestions, I set back out into the world with a new point of view. 

I started with Instagram, (a suggestion I was given), and sought out lovely enby people to follow and just find encouragement from. Forgot this was an old account and my (incredibly bigoted) oldest brother followed me and liked one of my pictures that I tagged as enby. Deleted the tag. Deleted Instagram. Again.

Meanwhile on the presentation front, I did some research and bought a compression bra, just as a starter binder in hopes it would help kick start me into this whole gender expression thing. Turns out it was kinda just a waste of money and stretched out quickly to a point where it did as much compression as a regular sports bra minus the comfort. After landing myself a job, I bought a custom binder as a birthday gift to myself, discovering that I'm one of those people that would rather drop a bunch of money on one thing and having it last rather than a little money but have to keep making repeat purchases.  Which isn't an enby fact, but it is still a lesson I learned. I'm kinda at a standstill as far as physical representation, considering there's a lot of things that I can't do because of work dress code policy and the sheer amount of time I no longer have for myself because of my job. 

My days off don't feel like time for me, it feels like recovery. I spend so much time around people with no recharge time, my legs hurt, my back hurts, I feel exhausted. Sometimes I'm caught off guard by the sound of my own name. Sometimes people will call me sir, which I think is just an accident most of the time, but it almost feels... nice(?) when people have to do a double take? Like HA! I almost had you! I know how feminine I look and sound, sometimes I wish I could change it, sometimes I don't care at all. 

I don't actually mind appearing feminine, I just wish I had more control over it. I don't really know how else to explain that. I have my binder now, I want to take it for a test run. Get my hair cut and just feel comfortable again. Not to mention its super hot here now and this long shit that I'm putting up with has got to stop. 

This just feels like venting but I don't have anyone to talk to. I have one trans friend but he lives a couple states away and he works a lot. My boyfriend doesn't really know much about all this but keeps telling me he loves me for who I am (even though my brain tries to tell me he's lying). I don't know.

For the criminalization of doctors and providers who administer HRT without a vigorous vetting process to determine if one's gender dysphoria is severe enough to warrant medical transitioning, as well as the arrests of patients who take HRT without severe dysphoria, and the immediate arrests of all who engage in DIY transitions.

Our movement right now is split, some of us feel that people should be able to do whatever they want with their bodies, however about 40% of them feel that DIY and informed consent should be criminally prosecuted. About 25% of us support forcible detransitioning to those who undergo the DIY method. On the whole, 75% want to ban informed consent entirely.

1) STOP CALLING FOR SELF ID. We believe that the process of changing ID should take a minimum of 2 years after formal diagnosis of Transsexualism under ICD 10.

2) STOP CALLING FOR DEMEDICALIZATION OF BEING TRANSGENDER. Simply put, if you do not have gender dysphoria YOU ARE NOT TRANSGENDER.

Hey! So I posted on here last week asking about STP packers. I know many AFAB NB people but it many have the desire, but I’ve found some do so I thought I’d share my experience with one.

I went with Number One Factories’ Number One STP. As far as STP/packer hybrids goes it’s one of the cheapest. Not SUPER realistic which was actually a draw for me but trans men have said they have used a urinal with them. 

I wanted one to alleviate *some* bottom dysphoria and also while out and about I hate sitting on public toilet seats. I’m very happy to announce that I’ve had zero “peeing down my leg” mishaps and it is nearly invisible when I pack with it (and super comfy!). I just cut a tiny hole on the back flap of men’s briefs/boxer briefs and it stays in place and packs up. I am on the heavier side (5’6”, 38 waist men’s pants). 

It was important to me to find one that didn’t have a bulge as I’m not trying to be read as male. So far I love it. I bought the harness that’s intended to go with it but honestly didn’t need it and found it to complicate things more.

275,2018-05-29 02:14:16,8mvfog,25,11,"hi! :3 I was wondering if any of you guys could give perspectives on being nonbinary. I'm currently questioning.

So, uhh, I guess this sentiment pops up a lot, but basically I *really don't want to be a ""special snowflake""* or whatever.

I've been thinking a lot about gender recently and I'm not sure what being nonbinary is all about. So, I'm AFAB and have always considered myself cis—like, I don't really think I've just thought much about this. I found out about being nonbinary and thought it sounded very intriguing, but I'm not sure what being NB really means.

Tbh, I think I have ""discomfort"" over my breasts, but I'm not sure if it's dysphoria or something else. I have been avoiding wearing bras for some time because of it, and I wish I could have a flatter chest. I've always wanted a smaller bust size, from when I was young, but I don't know why exactly. I bought a binder but I don't actually wear it since I wear a lot of layers. I am planning on perhaps wearing it during the summer though. Maybe it's just because I think it's cuter and more childish that way, since I don't know if it's a gender thing or just an eating disorder thing (since I have anorexia). I did feel bad about my breasts before my eating disorder flared up though.

Idk, as for pronouns and names and socially considering myself a woman I have no idea what that means, like to consider yourself a woman? I don't relate personally to talks about feminism sometimes but I don't know if that's just because I've not really experienced things that women and girls typically experienced or not. I sort of wish I were described as being more boyish or whatever, instead of feminine or womanly, idk. One time I got a short haircut and was really happy when my mom told me that someone at the salon was confused about my gender. About pronouns I don't know. I don't like being referred to in the third person for some reason—like ""she"" makes me feel awkward, but I don't know if ""they"" would be any better.

The thing is that I'm not sure what it means to be NB rather than,  idk, just want to mess around with gender roles, and I don't want to be appropriating an identity that isn't mine.

I think, mostly, it was still the right decision overall. But I've been struggling with it more and more lately.

I was tired of having bruises on my hips, I was tired of not being able to breathe or eat comfortably, and I was tired of being absolutely miserable in the summer. It was time.

Up until I started school everything was fine because I was in kindergarten group where everyone knew each other and we were just kids simple as that. Then I was suddenly middle of strangers, I got to feel that vague feeling when you are looked through or as something other than yourself, spoken in manner that for reason you can't define gives out there is some giant mistake at place, and the categorising to two began. I felt insanely insulted every time I was lumped somewhere based on gender no matter where it was. 


It's not because I thought girls (I'm afab) were inferior to boys in any way and I actually was friends with many. I was told everyone feels like this and that no one likes to be categorized. It could be true but I never saw it ruin entire complete afternoon for anyone else so either I'm crazy or there is a reason it always took toll on me.

I don't feel I'm more intelligent than those people, I just feel I'm inadequate and can't fill shoes I'm set to.


I feel constantly like something is off. Despite sometimes wishing I could look like guy just to reduce the pressure, I'm disproportionately frightened by anything in my appearance that isn't feminine. I can't wear short hairs, I'd die for feeling of being naked/exposed if I was made to wear a shirt guy could wear.

My name is Aaryn and I'd like some feedback on my situation~

Im 19 &amp; Ive been on T since 2014. comin up on 4 years here. I'm going to be 2 years post op (top surgery) this year as well. Never going to get bottom surgery because I'm 100% comfy with my nether regions. 
Let's crack into this then, shall we?
So pre T me would beat my face in hearing this, but- I dont like passing fully as a guy. I loved it for the first 2 years, but now I just dont like being classified as a guy. iunno , I just dont, it makes me feel uneasy. I'm obviously 'masculine' looking bc of T, but I still put in an effort to not hide my ' femininity '. I like embracing both. some days I feel more masc, others I feel more femme. I dont even like using those words most of the time because who's to say what's masculine/feminine? anyways, I'm not stealth. If I just met you then you're guaranteed to know I'm trans within an hour of talking to me. I'm very open and proud about it. Personally I prefer to identify as a trans non binary (they/them pronouns). I don't want to be labeled as a man, or a woman.  Honestly I feel like I'm both/neither.  I wish I could pass as androgynous bc I feel like it would help ease this new dysphoria I'm feeling(a second wave of dysphoria?? this is shocking to me). I get dysphoria from both binaries now, this shit is cray to me.

Any advice on this whole rant would be amazing , I dont have a lot of ppl I can talk to about it that understand. 
A few questions I've been thinking..

1. Why do I feel this way? I feel crazy.
2. I've thought about stopping T to see if i could maybe achieve some androgyny, comments ?
3. Any advice on how to look more andro?

Several others had already tried explaining what the term meant, and were subsequently sea-lioned and dehumanized.

I have no idea why I thought jumping in would be a good idea, but I did, and I got sucked into it.

I am kinda really... jumpy right now, adrenaline running high, hands kinda shaking. I have done such a good job curating my life both on and offline that it has been literal years since I had such a dehumanizing encounter.

I was wondering if you all may have some suggestions and advice for things I could do right now to help calm down? I want to just forget I made the mistake of engaging with these people, just have a good rest of my evening, but my mind keeps returning to them casually claiming it is impossible to both be human and be non-binary and other such outrageous and disgusting attacks.

But she looked a little angry  like she was expecting me to give her sh\*\* for it and instantly said *:""I didnt knew it was you, ive seen a transgirl sitting there in the waiting room just had no idea it was you.""* So i asked *her :""Oh so you.... instantly noticed i was tr*ans?""

Especially in a small  town, where people can be a little old fashion and be less tollerant no  one ever really stared at me in a weird way or said anything... and when  we made trips to bigger citys and went to the theater etc n one ever  gave me those ""stares."" even when i was in bigger crowds. I really was  so happy i could just blend into society and be female when im outside  and at home... And from what my therapist says there is no such a thing  as like complete ""Passing"" for her... it made me really anxious and i  got lost in my thoughts when she talked..... After the appointment was  over we left her office and walked to the secretary. We passed the  waiting room and she'd still continue talking about how she notices that  im trans and its because she is professional. The people in the waiting  room heard it and i was too afraid to look towards their way... when we  were standing infront of the secretary she'd *say ""Mrs XYZ you did notice this girl was trans too rig*ht?""

I think ts  important that therapists know why most of us are doing HRT, or doing  SRS... its because some of us just want to be female and dont want to be  labeled as trans ...

I think ts  important that therapists know why most of us are doing HRT, or doing  SRS... its because some of us just want to be female and dont want to be  labeled as trans ... I think thats the reason why most of us also want  to pass in the first place... so we can just be who we want to be,  Female, Male etc. I also really dont care how professional her eye is  because she worked with transpeople for years... in my eyes she wasnt  professional, but very unprofessional instead...', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My therapist is giving me anxiety.', 'created': 1525538269.0}"

I used this app called voice pitch analyzer for fun and the pics in order are:
1. my regular speaking voice
2. when i try to pitch it high while still sounding normal
3. when i try to pitch it low

I’m non-binary and I have been on testosterone twice, the first time for two months, the second time for three. 

I was off and on because I just wanted some changes. After this second round I feel like I’ve gotten to a good place with my voice and body hair and I’m content. 

But I’ve noticed my voice has changed in the six months since I was last on T! Since I don’t see a lot of people talking about their experiences going on and off T multiple times I thought I would share mine. 

My voice deeper now than it was before the second round, but now i can pitch my voice higher without discomfort more than i could right after i stopped taking it.

I noticed this after my first time taking T as well, but less drastically because my voice didn’t get as low as it did the second time. 

I just think it’s cool because while there is a definite permanent change to my voice, things changed physically after I stopped T as well.

I feel such overwhelming joy when I imagine myself as a guy (albeit a slightly effeminate one) with a penis and facial hair, and I think I experience dysphoria when I look at pictures of tall, skinny dudes and also when I have makeup on (seriously, everything about it feels so wrong and weird it freaks me out). But there are aspects of my feminine self I don't want to give up; for example I don't want to stop having boobs, and I like wearing women's shoes and (sometimes) clothes.

As you all know, my (now ex) boyfriend broke up with me in a really cold and uncaring way. I struggled with what to do with the binder I had purchased for him as my conscience and my pettiness duked it out. I thought about it for days, talked to everyone I knew, and finally came to a conclusion. I gave him the binder.

 I realized that even if I didn't think he was trans, what if he really was? Am I really going to deprive him of the one chance he has to express himself? To pass? No, I'm not. I realized that if he's ever going to grow up-- if he's ever going to feel sorry for what he did-- that I had to be the bigger person and show him that kindness. That being said, I didn't dismiss what he did. I wrote him a letter saying that even though what he did was cruel, that I was still going to support him in his transition if that's the path he chose to take.

He was wearing it today, along with a shirt we bought from the men's section. He looked so comfortable and bright. I think that's when I knew I'd made the right decision. 

And with that, my trans boyfriend binder saga comes to a close. Thanks so much to everyone in this sub who helped me and gave me advice.

61,2018-05-09 19:29:19,8i8qac,8,15,"I am so sorry if I shouldn’t be posting here if I am still figuring things out I have always associated with the term transgender when I thought about it and it was recently suggested I consider exploring more including non-binary. I am also sorry for just how much I have to say I don't know how to edit myself sometimes.

My question is more do I deserve to “come out” as Trans or Non Binary than am I those things. And does my story line up with people in this community enough that I can associate with it.

I am 22/female I am confident but self-deprecating, that’s important I think. 

Aesthetically my mental picture of myself is a guy and that has always been my normal. I have always dressed myself as a guy hell when I was in preschool I cried when I spilled juice on my pants and my only back up clothes was a dress, my mom had to pick me up early because I wouldn’t leave the bathroom wearing it.  But I dismiss that as “I just like guy’s clothes that isn’t important or significant”.

In middle school I hardcore stared to hate being called a girl or worse yet a young lady, it made me cringe. I didn’t want to be called a boy either I just didn’t want it addressed. I was wearing oversized clothes including jackets in the dead of summer to cover my body. I also rebelled against bras because that was going to be crossing a hard line into becoming a woman. At this point I thought I was just scared of growing up and puberty. As I am typing this I realize for the first time that I wasn’t scared to grow up as much as I was scared of becoming a woman, it’s weird when things make sense when you talk it out for real for the first time. I thought it was normal to hate yourself and your body so I let it lie.

High school was just me dressing like a guy in a construction class trring desperately to convince other that my online boyfriend was real and I wasn’t gay.

In college I made a few great progressive fiends, learned that life isn’t black and white, male and female for the first time and I started to feel ok-ish.

About a year ago I joked with my boyfriend (the totally real one from high school) about how “I dress like a guy I should just be one lol” and he joked back “omg just come out as trans already lol” and it has not left my mind once since then. A little while after that I threw out all of the feminine clothes I held onto but never wore and I bought my first sports bra in years and then another and another until it was all I had. I had a panic attack a few months ago about how much I hated being a girl in this world and cried until I fell asleep but that’s mostly frustration over the social/political climate.
 
I know I can’t be cis and feel this way but I also feel like I don’t deserve to “come out” as anything especially if I don’t know exactly what that anything is and If all I feel like I need to be totally happy is cut my hair, bind my chest and MAYBE be referred to as him/he. My now husband has in the last few days told me for the millionth time that he would love me no matter how I presented. My mom would never understand and kind of just be confused by it but would just be supportive. My friends don’t feel close enough to really care one way or another.

I DO NOT want to be all like “This is ME now” when I haven’t face nearly the hardships that some people have with their gender identity that’s why I ask if I deserve to feel this way. 

TLDR: I know I am not a cis gender female and if I did “come out” as anything else I would be loved and supported by who matter to me but should I if I won’t be making any big changes in my life? Would it be worth it to tell my mom that I don’t feel like a girl if it would only kinda confuse her but she would be supportive?

I would consider myself a relatively rational person and before that moment I had researched a lot about trans (mainly for general interest and curiosity) therefore I knew that if she felt that she was a female, then it was something that couldnt be helped and I knew that she needed as much support possible. Therefore, this rational sense made me put my own emotions to the side and forget about how I felt - I had been so concerned with supporting her, not upsetting her and trying not to say the wrong thing (which I have done a few times which I feel very bad for) that I had completely forgotten to address how I truly felt and my own process that I had to deal with. I had a brother for over 20 years and then all of a sudden, I felt like I had lost one. You could say that I ""gained"" a sister, but for some reason it doesnt feel like that.

1. I must support her
2. I dont have a brother anymore
3. I feel guilty for missing the brother figure
4. I feel guilty for not feeling like I have ""gained"" a sister
5. I must deal with my own process yet still make sure that I am supportive at the same time
6. Constant worry about how she is doing

its a mixture of emotions! I am not saying that I dont want her to be trans, I mean, it is hard enough being trans as it is - let alone not having your family support you.

I have spoken to her about this a couple times so its not a massive secret (we are pretty open with each other) yet I still do not feel a lot better about all these emotions.

In short I was suspecting it a couple years ago, then thought I was rather just ""atypical male"" but gave myself some freedom to explore being more feminine. Two weeks ago after another dream about looking and presenting as a girl and some dysphoria again, realized I still don't feel right about myself.

I've been thinking and reading a lot in last 2-3 weeks, I realized how much I lied to myself and that being male feels more like smth I can cope with rather then a way in which I can be truly happy and confident. My therapist agrees I have a gender problem and I also managed to relax a bit in feeling female (a bit hard to explain) and at those times I felt soo much better.

The thing is, I still feel like I oscillate. I understand it's all kinda me, it's just that I am not only used to but also worked hard to accept and feel good about myself while I thought I was male and I am kinda proud how far I got. I learned to stop trying to fit in (by being more masculine), I unlearned some things I was still thaught as a male (mostly problematic), and I felt like I finally respected myself and that others respect me too for some things I really am. So it's not that I hate it nor I feeel like rejecting my whole masculine side.
But then again a big part of my confidence, my emotions and who I really am felt so buried in my mind before I started accepting I might be trans. I thought I would need so many years to get to it and now a simple answer to everything pops up: ""You are a girl!"". But I get so emotional and excited that it's hard to stick to it for longer and I end up back in my regular self, not feeling much. Or I keep analyzing my thoughts and behaviour, afraid I am doing smth wrong or just imagining the whole thing bc of oscillations.ć. Like I will go back to ""normal"". But I'd rather not, it might be easier but at some point it gets to being unmotivated and like I might just choose suicide instead of coffe.

I am simply not sure what to expect, how 'should' I feel, what to do? The change itself also feels somehow strange now (I am 22y old). And that I might finally express what has been in my head like very personal stuff. I will get some clothes and makeup soon and hang out with friends as a girl but I am afraid how will I 'jump into' that, what if I just slip into feeling nothing?

I am 26, Male-to-Female. Several years into transition, Though I learned a couple years in that I’m also inter-sexed which adds complication I suppose. I’m afraid this is likely going to be a long read.

&amp;nbsp; 

Mother’s Day is rather hard on me, Struggling with my emotions. It brings up feelings of being hopeless, Worthless, incomplete. The idea of being broken beyond repair, questioning if it’s all even worth it. I never have a harder time fighting self harm than on mother’s day. My life didn’t decide it was enough for me to be Trans, Or to be inter-sexed. It found it proper to keep dumping things on me. Once upon a time I somewhat came to terms with my limitations, Accepted that someday I would look forward to adopting. Deep down it hurt more than I could put into words but I fought to move forward even if being infertile as a girl seemed like enough in my mind to justify dying. I have kept fighting, through severe abuse and struggle.

&amp;nbsp; 

 I’ve always had hypothyroidism, My endo always told me it was why even with estrogen I never saw much of a change with hrt, never got much breast development. More or less stayed the same really, I guess part of that I can credit to being inter-sexed, I’m thankful that I’ve always pretty much passed so that is nice. But my life didn’t see that as enough, A couple years ago I started having more severe health problems. I developed severe migraines, Like Really really bad. A particular variety of migraine referred to as “hemipelegic migraines”, Put simply it’s like your brain short circuiting. In addition to the usual pain, nausea, sensitivity to light and sound you can expect from a migraine I also get stroke like symptoms, Slurred speech, Confusion, Numbness and paralysis in my right side. Significant near blindness in my right eye. Being that I’m not uneducated in potential complications of hrt,,Like strokes I panicked the first time it happened, Cue the first trip to the ER for me. A CT scan, IV fluids and $2000 later..The diagnosis “migraines” and I was sent home with a prescription for the pain. A week later I collapsed at work with another one. This time someone called an ambulance for me. I wasn’t given the option to say no, so more bills and off to the ER with me once again. Same diagnosis, Except this time the dreadful news of stopping all HRT. I was horrified, crushed. But even after a few weeks of being hormone free I was still having these migraines. I eventually lost my job, Only to be sent of for another CT scan, And an MRI..Both of which came back clean. There was nothing “Wrong” with me, Just these awful experiences. They are miserable and frequent. They have kept me from working, or getting anything done. I ran out of money long before getting any sort of diagnosis as to why I have them and the neurologist I spoke to, by his tone didn’t believe I was having them. The good news is I now have a very supportive boyfriend whom I am grateful for. I have as much support as I could ask for. But deep down it makes this day hurt more.

It wasn’t until two years ago that it actually struck me, Mother’s day 2016. I had gotten over the fact I would never bare a child only now to realize that I will likely never get the opportunity to adopt either.
It’s been paralyzing dread, I should be on disability. I should apply for it, I should seek it out. But I don’t even know if I could qualify, I don’t have a diagnosis and I can’t even prove I have these dreadful things. As I am I will never be financially stable enough to support a child even if I could adopt...But if I were to seek out disability, I doubt I’d ever be able to adopt. Or even worse, If I have a diagnosis. Should my dream come true, medical science finally being progressive. that someday the option for me to bare a child presents it self, A diagnosis like “chronic hemiplegic migraine disorder” would disqualify me from ever experiencing the thing I want more than anything else. I struggle with every day but seem to make forward motion. I’m back on hormones which is it’s own small gift. And I’m now struggling to make ends meet as an artist working from home. But it’s barely enough to feed me, and I still suffer with multiple migraines a week. On normal days I get by, But On Mother’s Day...I realize that the thing I dreamed of since I was little, Will never come true. No matter how loving I am, How much I think I deserve it. I’m not fit to be a mother, No matter how much I tell my self it’s not my fault. The world has decided it will never happen. I will never have children of my own even if it warms my dreams every single night. I will never be stable enough to offer a safe home to any child through adoption. I feel this crushing chill that I will never be whole.

&amp;nbsp; 

Mother’s day more than any other day, makes me want to die. It drags up urges of self harm.drives me to want to be in pain. It makes me feel like I deserve to suffer. Somehow deep down my mind starts to dig at me, to pry at my will. It makes me feel that I deserve this, That perhaps in some past life I did something so unspeakably horrible, that life would forbid me from the one thing my mind tells me I truly want more than all else. My logical mind tells me it’s just another day, That it changes nothing. It makes it worse by making me feel absurd… I feel disappointed in my self for being upset. I hate my self for being so hurt.

I suppose I should probably start by introducing myself. Hi! I'm Alexandria, and I'm trans AMAB, and prefer she/her/hers pronouns, thank you very much. I'm 17 years old, 6 ft 2.5 in, have ADHD, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD, and started my journey of questioning my gender since January 2016. 


My earliest memory of any kind of ""confusion"" was when I was around 7 (2007, I guess the great thing about being born in 2000 is that the year is always my age). I had been playing around with makeup, and I had nail polish and lipstick on, and I remember feeling girly, and I remember liking it. My mom was going to Lifetime Fitness and she decided to take me with her, not knowing that I was all bedazzled up. When we arrived there, she looked back to the backseat, and I distinctly remember the look on her face when she saw me. Disapproval and scolding. She told me that I cant be going out looking like that and that boys aren't supposed to use makeup. I remember wanting to cry so badly, not understanding what was ever wrong with wanting to look girly. She made me take it all off before we went inside, and as the scent of acetone filled my nose, I started to cry. Not from the scent, but from what it meant, I guess. After that, there were other less significant ones like wanting to dress up with my step sisters but my dad saying no, wanting to do stereo-typically feminine things, and sometimes dressing up in my moms clothes when she wasn't home, and how good and cathartic it made me feel.


This all continued until middle school, where everyone started calling everything ""gay"" and didn't want to be negatively associated with all of that. I didn't have many friends and I was very self conscious about the way I looked, given I started puberty when I turned 12. Pimples everywhere. Hella voice drop. For reference, if anyone knows music stuff, my voice can hit an A1. Believe your eyes. A1. My normal talking voice now is around 90hz (something like an F#2), which is extremely dysphoric for me now, and has always been a source of anxiety for me, as I don't exactly like it. That summer I grew from 5 foot 5 in to 5 foot 11 in. I was the TALLEST 7th grader. I have stretch marks all over my butt, back, thighs, and knees. I can post pics of these if enough people request it. It looks like I got attacked by an animal XD.


I cut for the first time on December 22nd, 2015. My mom took me straight to the hospital. She was so upset with me, I remember. Everything was just getting to be too much. My mom has really high expectations of me. She got a 36 on her ACT (perfect score) and a 1500 something on her SAT (almost perfect) and had a 4.0 GPA throughout highschool and college. Her IQ is 146. I was starting to fall behind in school, and she reacted to this by taking away anything that made me feel happy. My phone, my DS lite, my free time with friends (including my girlfriend at the time), books, etc. She would then hover over me while i sit at the kitchen table trying to focus but to no avail, as medication can only do so much for my ADHD. I came out to her sometime around February 2016, and I came out as transgender. I remember her saying things like ""You dont need to be focusing on these things right now"" and ""You have plenty of time to figure this stuff out later, right now your priority needs to be school work"" and ""being.... that.... would make your life so much harder than it already is. You think you have it hard now, but you just wait and see"" and even going as far as to interrogate me (in the metaphorical sense) about why I think I'm trans. I didn't know how to answer. How does anyone answer that question? All I knew was that I was a girl, and I was being questioned on it. Right back into the closet I went. Anyhow, my realization that I was trans came in January 2016, after my girlfriend at the time said that she was pansexual. At this point, I felt comfortable enough to tell her that I used to dress up all the time (and still did occasionally), and she was very excited and supportive of this. She said that I might be trans, and I thought it sounded off but might be. She started using she/her/hers pronouns and I remember how right it felt. We went to her place after school one day and we dressed me up in her clothes and it made me so happy to share this with someone else. Another day (May 31st, 2016) we went onto her parents boat (who were very accepting of everything) and I went wearing trunks and a bikini. The feeling was amazing. People were around but nobody gave me looks (i guess i must have passed :), and I had no idea how good an article of clothing could ever make me feel. It wasn't long after, though, that she broke up with me. It was June 10th, and I had been accepted into an early college program just the night before. This was one of the first real anxiety attacks that I had because it would mean that I wouldn't get to see her anymore. We had both been suffering a lot from depression, and for her, anxiety too. Anyways, on the 10th (3 days before my birthday, mind you) she breaks up with me. She said I wasn't good for her mental health (which was true) and that it wasn't a healthy relationship (it really wasn't healthy). I had never loved someone as much as I loved her, trusted someone as much as her, and that moment is when my downward spiral started. I came home and my mom wouldn't be there for me. She told me (notice the reoccurring theme here) that there were ""more important things to be thinking about and putting my energy into"". I spilled my fucking heart out to her and cried alone in the fetal position in my bedroom with a pillow covering my ears as she screamed at me from outside of my door about how I'm an emotional mess and how I just need to suck it up and stop crying. I cut so deep that night that its still my biggest scar I have. My birthday came and went. Another day. No friends. Just me, alone, emotionally wrecked, and nothing but my own broad shoulders (which also made me dysphoric) to cry on. 


That summer came and went. I found out that she had cheated on me with a cis girl, and it killed me. I trusted her so much. Its been the main focus of every anxiety attack I've had since. Not being good enough (only exacerbated by my moms high expectations), constant fear of being cheated on, left. I was depressed the whole summer, and had been depressed until just about 1 month ago. Everything felt so fake. I cut every single night; it was the only way I could block out everything else. I became addicted to it, and after a while it became part of my every day routine. But even as a new hope loomed in the distance (going to my new school), I feared it was only a curse in disguise. I was so anxious about meeting all new people and having to make all new friends and it all just seemed so overwhelming. It was right around then that I got my license and a car, and a job at Target to pay for it all (more on this later!). 


First day. I decided to shed my old name (AJ, short for Alexander John) and go by Alex because it was more gender neutral. Over the summer, I was so fixated and obsessed with my old relationship that when i thought about all my gender issues, it all just seemed... I don't know. Blurred? I identified as gender fluid from September 2016 up until just about 2 months ago. I guess I knew deep down that I was a girl, but I really wanted to figure things out with my emotions and stuff and it was a lot easier to just be gender fluid. Something that I wasn't. Truth is, it wasn't easier. I was miserable. Again, still with the verbal abuse from my mom. Constant disappointment, taking away things that make me happy, etc.


But then a new ray of hope. A new girlfriend. She helped me stop cutting and is always there for me, even if she doesn't understand what I'm going through or why I'm feeling the way i am at a specific moment in time. I'm still with her today!!! We became a couple on January 31st, 2017. I let her know that I was genderfluid, but that didn't seem to bother her, despite the fact that she thought she was straight. Anyhow, its about then that i grew a beard. Not just any beard. Ill post a pic. It was enormous. I looked about 11 years older than I actually was. For me it was more of an experiment. Just to see what i was comfortable with. Problem is, I got a lot of positive reinforcement from it, and while that made me feel good about the way I looked, it isn't about what other people think. Deep down I guess I knew I was girl and many nights i spent my time crying and pulling at my face because I couldn't stand the way it felt. The next year went by alot better, and by February of 2018, I went to see a therapist and she referred me to a psychiatrist who upon hearing about all the things that I was going to told me that I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD. I was prescribed Lexapro, and we switched my ADHD medication, and ever since then, everything has been so much better and clearer. I came out to my girlfriend as trans, and she took it well, considering she didnt think she was straight. Apparently she's Panromantic and Heteroflexible (shes into boobs and femininity, but not the female version of the down there areas, which is totally fine because I like how things are down there too), and my coming out to her has opened her up to all of that. In the last 2 weeks, I came out to all of my school proximity associates and my teachers, my therapist, my one trans male friend, and Target. Target was just today. I told the HR rep, and he's going to tell most everybody for me. It feels really good to have such an amazing support team :).


But then there's my mom. I bet you can guess what she said when she came out to me if you very graciously took the time to read my life story XD. ""There are more important things to be focusing on right now"". Things are a little better, and she avoids pronouns, but still refuses to call me Alex. She's kinda a TERF.....


Anyways! That's where I am right now, doing voice training every single day and trying to avoid my mother at all costs. Thank you so much for reading if you did take the time to read all of that!! If you have any questions, Id be more than happy to answer! Have a wonderful days, ladies and gents and non binaries and aliens!


Sending love and support your way,

-Alexandria Noelle

We went to her place after school one day and we dressed me up in her clothes and it made me so happy to share this with someone else. Another day (May 31st, 2016) we went onto her parents boat (who were very accepting of everything) and I went wearing trunks and a bikini. The feeling was amazing. People were around but nobody gave me looks (i guess i must have passed :), and I had no idea how good an article of clothing could ever make me feel. It wasn\'t long after, though, that she broke up with me. It was June 10th, and I had been accepted into an early college program just the night before. This was one of the first real anxiety attacks that I had because it would mean that I wouldn\'t get to see her anymore. We had both been suffering a lot from depression, and for her, anxiety too. Anyways, on the 10th (3 days before my birthday, mind you) she breaks up with me. She said I wasn\'t good for her mental health (which was true) and that it wasn\'t a healthy relationship (it really wasn\'t healthy). I had never loved someone as much as I loved her, trusted someone as much as her, and that moment is when my downward spiral started. I came home and my mom wouldn\'t be there for me. She told me (notice the reoccurring theme here) that there were ""more important things to be thinking about and putting my energy into"". I spilled my fucking heart out to her and cried alone in the fetal position in my bedroom with a pillow covering my ears as she\xa0screamed at me from outside of my door about how I\'m an emotional mess and how I just need to suck it up and stop crying. I cut so deep that night that its still my biggest scar I have. My birthday came and went. Another day. No friends. Just me, alone, emotionally wrecked, and nothing but my own broad shoulders (which also made me dysphoric) to cry on.\xa0\n\n\nThat summer came and went. I found out that she had cheated on me with a cis girl, and it killed me. I trusted her so much. Its been the main focus of every anxiety attack I\'ve had since. Not being good enough (only exacerbated by my moms high expectations), constant fear of being cheated on, left. I was depressed the whole summer, and had been depressed until just about 1 month ago. Everything felt so fake. I cut every single night; it was the only way I could block out everything else. I became addicted to it, and after a while it became part of my every day routine. But even as a new hope loomed in the distance (going to my new school), I feared it was only a curse in disguise. I was so anxious about meeting all new people and having to make all new friends and it all just seemed so overwhelming. It was right around then that I got my license and a car, and a job at Target to pay for it all (more on this later!).\xa0\n\n\nFirst day. I decided to shed my old name (AJ, short for Alexander John) and go by Alex because it was more gender neutral. Over the summer, I was so fixated and obsessed with my old relationship that when i thought about all my gender issues, it all just seemed... I don\'t know. Blurred? I identified as gender fluid from September 2016 up until just about 2 months ago. I guess I knew deep down that I was a girl, but I really wanted to figure things out with my emotions and stuff and it was a lot easier to just be gender fluid. Something that I wasn\'t. Truth is, it wasn\'t easier. I was miserable. Again, still with the verbal abuse from my mom. Constant disappointment, taking away things that make me happy, etc.\n\n\nBut then a new ray of hope. A new girlfriend. She helped me stop cutting and is always there for me, even if she doesn\'t understand what I\'m going through or why I\'m feeling the way i am at a specific moment in time. I\'m still with her today!!! We became a couple on January 31st, 2017. I let her know that I was genderfluid, but that didn\'t seem to bother her, despite the fact that she thought she was straight. Anyhow, its about then that i grew a beard. Not just any beard. Ill post a pic. It was enormous. I looked about 11 years older than I actually was. For me it was more of an experiment. Just to see what i was comfortable with. Problem is, I got a lot of positive reinforcement from it, and while that made me feel good about the way I looked, it isn\'t about what other people think. Deep down I guess I knew I was girl and many nights i spent my time crying and pulling at my face because I couldn\'t stand the way it felt. The next year went by alot better, and by February of 2018, I went to see a therapist and she referred me to a psychiatrist who upon hearing about all the things that I was going to told me that I have Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and PTSD. I was prescribed Lexapro, and we switched my ADHD medication, and ever since then, everything has been so much better and clearer. I came out to my girlfriend as trans, and she took it well, considering she didnt think she was straight. Apparently she\'s Panromantic and Heteroflexible (shes into boobs and femininity, but not the female version of the down there areas, which is totally fine because I like how things are down there too), and my coming out to her has opened her up to all of that. In the last 2 weeks, I came out to all of my school proximity associates and my teachers, my therapist, my one trans male friend, and Target. Target was just today. I told the HR rep, and he\'s going to tell most everybody for me. It feels really good to have such an amazing support team :).\n\n\nBut then there\'s my mom. I bet you can guess what she said when she came out to me if you very graciously took the time to read my life story XD. ""There are more important things to be focusing on right now"". Things are a little better, and she avoids pronouns, but still refuses to call me Alex. She\'s kinda a TERF.....\n\n\nAnyways! That\'s where I am right now, doing voice training every single day and trying to avoid my mother at all costs. Thank you so much for reading if you did take the time to read all of that!! If you have any questions, Id be more than happy to answer! Have a wonderful days, ladies and gents and non binaries and aliens!\n\n\nSending love and support your way,\n\n-Alexandria Noelle\n\n', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'My Story', 'created': 1526291372.0}"

Like I said in my disclaimer, I need some help sorting this matter out in my mind. For a while now, I’ve felt some frustration with trans women and crossdressers/sissies being lumped together in the minds of cis people. For this post, I’m largely going to be focusing on trans women rather than trans men and non-binary people, because a) my experience is that of a tran’s woman, and b) because “”women’s things”” are almost always relegated to the women’s domain, whereas “”men’s things”” are more acceptable for everyone. I could explain this further, but that’s a whole other topic. Though I just want to recognize that their are AFAB crossdressers, and I invite everyone to share in discussion.

&amp;nbsp;

For as long as certain groups have been repressed, oppressors have used scare tactics to maintain their power. In the case of trans folk, cis people often make baseless and inflammatory accusations that trans people are perverts and predators, trying to invade spaces they don’t belong in order to take advantage of others. It’s offensive and infuriating to know that, with enough repetition, some people begin to believe these lies whether consciously or unconsciously.

&amp;nbsp;

For this reason, I’m particularly sensitive to having crossdressers and sissy fetishists grouped in with trans women, or even under the trans* umbrella as a whole. I admit some naiveté to the exact nature of crossdressers/sissies interests, but my understanding is that a big reason both are done is for sexual purposes—as kinks. Of course there are other reasons for crossdressing, like performance (as with drag) or preference of self expression deviating from gender norms, but by and large most accounts I’ve heard from crossdressers is about sexual thrill.

&amp;nbsp;

I don’t think there’s any issue with crossdressing/sissy fetishism at all, for any reason; I think people should feel free to explore sexuality and kinks in safe and consensual ways. There is probably even some importance of trans people finding their gender identity through crossdressing and the like. My main discomfort is with CDs/sissies and trans people being grouped together by a cis/het/vanilla public at large, who often make no effort to differentiate one another when forming bigoted arguments against us.

#TL;DR—crossdressers ≠ trans women, plz stop grouping us together cis people.

So my questions are:

-Has anyone else felt this frustration?

-Am I being ridiculous?

-Should be more accepting of CDs under the trans* umbrella?

But I'm talking to people who are in a place where therapy and HRT is available, but due to anxiety or other factors are considering a DIY method. 

I'm not going to discuss if I think DIY methods are effective or not either. That's not really something I know a lot about and a lot more intelligent people have written about that subject. 

That was all preface. Whew. That got wordy.

The other day I was looking at some of the sites I had bookmarked on an old PC relating to DIY hormones, before I decided to go the clinical route. I noticed many of the sites were gone, and of those that were not, many were not currently stocked. So I started poking around out of curiosity, and during that time a pretty big red flag went up. 

One thing about any method, is that it needs to be consistent. If you miss days individually it isn't bad but if you go a week or a month without your supplement things stop working. Almost all of these sites are sketchy. The ones that seem legit come and go, and are often out of stock. Getting a consistant supply with DIY methods seems tricky. I'm sure some people have managed it, or found a hail mary website, but going the clinical route is so much better. They take blood and make sure the doses are right, they aren't giving you placebos or only half of what you need (T-blockers are just as, if not more important. I take 2 100mg t-blockers a day and 2mg of estrogen, for reference). My therapist is awesome, and so was my doctor. Picking up my script once a month is easy, and visiting a doctor every 3 months is something you should maybe do anyways if you have insurance? 

Anyway, I know there are reasons DIY can be the only option. But if you happen to be lucky enough to have a choice... I really recommend the clinical way of doing things.

But I'm talking to people who are in a place where therapy and HRT is available, but due to anxiety or other factors are considering a DIY method. \n\nI'm not going to discuss if I think DIY methods are effective or not either. That's not really something I know a lot about and a lot more intelligent people have written about that subject. \n\nThat was all preface. Whew. That got wordy.\n\nThe other day I was looking at some of the sites I had bookmarked on an old PC relating to DIY hormones, before I decided to go the clinical route. I noticed many of the sites were gone, and of those that were not, many were not currently stocked. So I started poking around out of curiosity, and during that time a pretty big red flag went up. \n\nOne thing about any method, is that it needs to be consistent. If you miss days individually it isn't bad but if you go a week or a month without your supplement things stop working. Almost all of these sites are sketchy. The ones that seem legit come and go, and are often out of stock. Getting a consistant supply with DIY methods seems tricky. I'm sure some people have managed it, or found a hail mary website, but going the clinical route is so much better. They take blood and make sure the doses are right, they aren't giving you placebos or only half of what you need (T-blockers are just as, if not more important. I take 2 100mg t-blockers a day and 2mg of estrogen, for reference). My therapist is awesome, and so was my doctor. Picking up my script once a month is easy, and visiting a doctor every 3 months is something you should maybe do anyways if you have insurance? \n\nAnyway, I know there are reasons DIY can be the only option. But if you happen to be lucky enough to have a choice... I really recommend the clinical way of doing things.

I posted a couple of times recently about being intersex and I have to say that you all made me feel so welcome and respected - so thank you so much :) 
As I said before I am absolutely an ally, I don’t identify as trans, I identify (and was brought up as) female with certain intersex aspects (although physically I’m very obviously female etc). I’ve struggled with gender dysphoria and issues with my body image mainly because of my enlarged clitoris, which I’ve just had reduced and it’s made such a huge difference to my mental health (see previous post!) 
The only remaining thing that causes me dysphoria is my boobs. I’m slim/average sort of weight (5ft3 and about 9 stone), I’ve got hips and a bum that I’m confident about and not a big stomach. But my boobs are tiny, and sort of child like in form. I sort of feel like my entire body would be far better proportioned if I had bigger boobs, or at least with a more mature shape. The docs have said it’s basically not going to change and I’ve even asked them for E but they said it probably won’t make a difference because I’ve already had oestrogen throughout my life and my boobs have basically decided what shape they’re going to be etc. 
I know this sounds like a really minor issue and I’m probably in a very privileged position compared to what a lot of trans people go through but it does still cause me dysphoria so I hope you understand that :) 
Basically is there anything I can do? I’m not keen on the idea of a surgical increase in size. Do those breast pump things actually work?

So here are my questions:

1) I know I can start HRT just by going to my local Planned Parenthood that uses the informed consent model, BUT I was wondering if doing so would make getting surgery more difficult later on. Not physically(HRT is HRT), but legally. Like, would I be more likely to be denied surgery, since I didn’t get evaluated by a therapist? 

2) Should I even try to get a therapist? Do they make the process of transitioning any easier legally(getting surgery, changing legal documents to reflect gender, etc.)? 

3) Could not going through a therapist effect how my insurance would or wouldn’t cover any of my medical expenses? I know this relies on which insurance I have, but just generally speaking. Do most insurance companies care if you follow a path laid out by a therapist, or not?

 My wife is from California and we both live in AZ (in my home town) and while my old doc (third I've had out here due to issues with the other doctors) was recklessly overdosing me, not hearing my emotional and hormonal concerns, being completely unreachable for 6 months at a time, denying that there was anything we could do but put more and more Spiro into my system and raise my cortisol levels dangerously, making me a stressed out mess, I was losing my mind.

My WIFE on the other hand still video chatted with her out of state doctor who like...helped her. There were so many other options for my regimine and when I brought them up to my doctor she'd say something like 'well I use the original handbook for this and it doesn't call for any of that'

I never questioned my gender until about 6 months ago. I literally never considered it. But after leaving the all-boys secondary school I attended and now being in university living with and mostly associating with women, I’ve been assaulted by the thought that I want to be a girl almost constantly. I don’t really know what it is that I want: I can’t tell if I hate being a guy for example. When I look at myself in the mirror I’m not exactly overcome with horror or anything but I find it a little bit hard to really like what I’m seeing. Like, if someone looked like me I’d think they were fairly attractive. But for me theres something “off”. Maybe, I’m not sure. 

Similarly, I have an abstract idea that I’d love to wear traditionally feminine clothing, but I always default to very anonymous generic masc clothing because I don’t really feel like I know where to start. I know I’m bi, but whenever I imagine myself being in a relationship with a woman I think of us as lesbians (if that makes sense). My feelings towards both men and women are gay, somehow. Sorry if that’s a stupid thing to say. 

I think a lot of these thoughts first came about when I started following a bunch of trans women on Twitter. I felt like I was approaching something I needed when I spectated them, if that makes sense. Like they where on a path in life I also wanted to be on. 

All this said, I don’t feel like I really fully fit the bill for being a trans woman. I don’t think of myself as a woman (not now anyway) and I’m still not sure if a lot of this is a brief phase that’s come about just because I’m experiencing a lot of new things after having moved away from my parents.

193,2018-05-28 06:10:25,8mnxke,3,5,"Hello there, I'm an average American non-politically affiliated person. I just want to have a little rant about the trans bathroom debate in a place that might appreciate how I've felt about this topic for a while.

Now while I understand that it's a deep and important topic for you, I do not understand how you feel, how *much* it means to you, or anything to that degree, because I'm not trans, so I simply cannot really ""get it"". 

That being said, as an outsider, viewing this from the perspective of someone who generally spends their time observing the stupidity of all facets of American and world culture, I have a great feeling of...I think irritation might be the word for what I feel about this debate. I feel very, very irritated that in 2018, we are having huge public debates, that ultimately boil down to ""We do not want you to shit *here*."". It is incredibly irritating that with all the things in the world that are going on right now, which bathroom a person is allowed to dump their ass in is a *HOT* issue in most areas of this country. I understand that this is also about acknowledging that you are what you identify as as well, but the simple fact that society has such an issue with where you shit is unbelievable to me. The excuses I've heard have ranged from religious persecution (by the way, former southern baptist here, raised by a preacher, and I'm thinking Jesus either didn't care, or forgot to make rules about transgender people, because there's nothing there), the oh so popular ""*It* shouldn't be given special rights."", and of course ""I don't want a pervert around my children/I don't want to be in a bathroom with a man. He might rape me."". So I'd like to focus on that last one. 


If a guy is so ballsy that he's willing to rape a woman in a public bathroom, letting trans people into the bathrooms isn't going to matter one way or the other. Same with molesting little girls. Generally that happens when there are only the assaulter and the assaulted in the bathroom. They aren't going to do it with a crowd of people in there. So anything to do with rape or sexual assault is a moot point in the trans bathroom debate. If a rapist is really that motivated, trans or not, they're going to go into whatever bathroom and do it. No legislation is going to change that. Also a man might try to say that he is trans afterwards as if that was some kind of defense, but that's just the coyote trying desperately to chew it's arm off and get out of this. 

Also as a side note, the prominent bathroom sexual assaults are men against young boys. Nobody gives a fuck about that though. It doesn't fit into the conservative/regressive agenda, so it's not an issue worth discussing. 

So yeah, I just wanted to rant on this topic, because I am so irritated that society still fucks with you all in every way possible. You seem to be the last group of people that society is allowed to hate right out in the open, with absolutely no repercussions. It sucks, it really does, and I hope shit gets better soon.

31 days ago I had the realization and acceptance, laying awake in bed, almost midnight, I should have been asleep, but instead my mind was racing and my depression was eating away at me when I finally connected the dots, finally allowed my mind to entertain the thought that I might actually be trans and I couldn't run from it anymore. 

Today is my first therapy appointment.

When I called in to schedule it one week after the day I realized, I was so anxious just to get in there and start moving along. When they told me they couldn't see me until the end of the month I started to panic, I thought of finding another therapist, or taking time off work to get an earlier appointment. I didn't know how I'd find peace with myself in the next 20 days. I needed to start moving, I'd finally accepted it, finally started gaining momentum, I couldn't lose it or I knew how easy it would be to slip back into denial and acceptance. 

Well guess what happened in those 20 days? 

Yup, slipped back into denial. 

Today the reality is hitting me...or not hitting me. I feel disconnected from the world, it's still like this is all fake and I can just keep ignoring it and it will go away. My brain's going, ""What are you doing, this isn't you, you don't do things like this, you're just a regular guy, not trans at all. Cancel the appointment. You don't need this!"" 

I'm not used to taking my time with things. I'm all or nothing. But I can't do that here. Can't be like, ""Sign me up for dick removal tomorrow or I'll stay a man for life."" 

I'm not good at this. 

A month ago I wanted to come out to the world just to get it off my chest. I wanted to tell my family and close friends, or make a facebook post, I just wanted to get all the bad things over with so I could move forward.

One problem I have is that when I wear fitted women's clothes, my nipples show through. Sometimes I don't like this just because I don't like how it looks, and sometimes I also don't like it because it's a visual thing that clearly shows that I have small nipples (a male sex characteristic) and that I am not wearing a bra (a male cultural gender signal).

I've been thinking of the idea of wearing a sports bra to address both the nipple issue, and I wouldn't mind people noticing that I'm wearing a bra because that would send another ""not male"" gender signal.

I have tried on other bras and I don't like them -- they actually give me an appearance of *too much boob* and it looks unnatural to me. I rather like my chest as-is, I have more shape than you'd expect for someone as skinny as I am, and when I wear feminine fitted shirts or the right dress it makes my form look pretty in-between.

Over the last year, I had Avascular Necrosis and was put in a wheelchair while going through a couple intense surgeries. While I was in the hospital, my parents refused to visit (they'd been mad at me for living with some trans friends) so I decided fuck it, I'm going to come out.

My parents and basically my entire extended family disowned me. I went through a lot of this medical stuff alone, with the exceptions of a couple close friends, and things have been rough for a year. I've lost friends from coming out, life is WAY different shifting from passibly straight to visibly queer. 

Anyway, the other day a friend of mine kind of snapped on me that she takes it very personally that I think I'm having a rough time, and I've been sad about it. She gave me this really long speech where she outright said ""I have been through worse than you, my life is harder than yours is"" because she had a major surgery when she was a teenager and also came out as bisexual as a teenager. 

I kind of feel like a lot of this is out of line. I don't think trauma should be a dick-measuring competition in the first place.  Ever since I've known her (and as far as I know, always) she exclusively dates men. And I don't want to invalidate her experiences, but I also think it's very easy for her to be straight-passing and I think she doesn't understand what this transition has been like.

Anyway, as of late I've been thinking about my identity. Growing up, I always had a sort of feminine side and a sort of masculine side. All my best friends were girls, and I loved letting them do my makeup, which I couldn't do myself due to my blindness. But I also loved, and still love, doing martial arts, shooting guns, and singing heavy metal music—traditionally ""masculine"" things, supposedly. Anyway, I'm really into the idea of exploring my gender identity, but I have no idea how to start. So far, I've just been doing things that make me happy—painting my nails, piercing my ears, and buying some cute skirts that I still haven't had the courage to wear outside. Pretty much the only time I've managed to explore my desire to dress in feminine attire is by way of cosplaying at a local Sailor Moon convention. But I guess the point of this post is just that I am confused. I don't know where to start. What am I? How do I identify? Why do I like makeup and glitter if I can't even see it? I just want to understand myself, and to figure out what it means to feel how I do, and what to do with that knowledge. I would welcome any advice, questions, thoughts, etc.

BTW, not that it's super relevant, but here's a link to some of my cosplay, just to show how I've kind of explored looks that make me feel happy. It's a video promoting cosplay for folks with disabilities, but I think it's helpful because the first bit shows me in male attire, while the latter bit shows me in my outfit.

Since then I've begun working in getting in shape, which has gone really well. I've lost lots of weight and looking a lot better since accepting myself. My health is doing really awesome actually.

Yesterday was the big day. Scheduled consultation with the most trans friendly surgeon I could find in the Chicago area.

He seemed way to overly skeptical about me being genderqueer/non-binary as I don't look ""feminine enough""(which the part the pains me very deeply is what I was seeing him about fixing) and the entire concept seemed utterly foreign to him.

He began going on about how I would need a therapist etc to sign off on this first. And then when he found out I had that already he began going on about how I still need to loose more weight, picking some numbers with out even bothering to inquire about how much I weight, my health, or anything.

I am just feeling really depressed and sad. Been crying on and off for nearly the last 24 hours now.

I am tired of the pain of my brain telling me my chest is not right and there are bits missing. I am tired of being purely male.

Wearing falsies does not help. Just makes it more painful. It serves as a reminder of what is missing.

Then to make stuff worse. United fellates fetid donkey dong. Finding a kink/poly friendly person in network is really problematic when it comes to LGBT therapists. Mine is out of network, meaning I unfortunately can't see her to often.

15,2018-05-04 20:57:42,8h2jyx,25,56,"Sorry for this novel, tl;dr at the end:

was completely out as nonbinary, they/them pronouns, name change, androgynous clothes, binder, etc, for two years. Then I moved back to my home red state and got a ""temporary"" job at a preschool. I went back to presenting as a woman for this job. Then I realized how much I loved the job. After a year I realized I wanted to pursue early childhood education, and then started a horrible internal gender conflict. 

First I just tried to not think about it. Then I actually tried to see if I could ""go back"" to being cis (lol). Like forget what it felt like to be out and proud. This was weird for my parents because it had been hard for them to accept me being nb, although they were supportive. I was like ""I have to be in the closet for work. Maybe I can live this way forever. Gender is fake/performative anyway."" 

Well, one year of doublethink and I had a big come to jesus moment. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't ""make"" myself cis. I was able to squelch dysphoria some and reconnect with woman-ness. I no longer cringe at being seen as a woman, she/her pronouns, and feel like I do have a place in women's spaces. BUT the truth never goes away. It's like a rock in my shoe. I really am nonbinary and wishing it away doesn't change anything. Even if I didn't know being nonbinary was an ""option"" I'd feel this way and not have a name for it. 

But I want to teach young children. I al going back to school in the fall for an ECED degree and hopefully I'll teach kindergarten or first grade. Trans teachers, especially in lower grades, don't fare so well. Especially in my state. I don't want to be the one to fight that battle either. It's easier to stay in the closet, even though I feel like a traitor and a liar. 

I guess the best term for me right now is ""nonbinary woman"" or ""agender woman,"" because as I read once somewhere, ""my gender is nonbinary, my social class is woman."" I still feel weird and horrible about it though. I'm basically choosing my career over my gender identity. And the mental logistics... how is this going to affect me in the future? What about dating? I don't trust cis men... what if I go into a wlw space and then later have to say ""I'm NB but in the closet forever,"" will I look like a liar? I still want top surgery... how am I going to explain that? It's horrible, I hate it. That's all. 

TL;DR I went from being totally out back to being in the closet for a preschool job, realized I wanted to be a kindergarten teacher, now I'm planning on staying in the closer forever for the sake of my future career.

I'm AMAB, somewhere between genderqueer, nonconforming, genderfluid, nonbinary at this point...really still exploring my identity/expression but I've always had a thing for ""feminine"" stuff. As I've gotten to be more comfortable with my \(still questioning\) self I've gotten more and more confident shopping as guy in the women's section for myself.

I had tried to find information on David's LGBTQ\+ openness on Reddit and Google but wasn't able to find much, so I hope this will appear when the next person like me looks for information like this. Sorry in advance if it's a little long, but this was a great experience and I want to share everything I can to help someone else out down the road!

Friday, I took a mental health day from work and decided to try something I've always wanted to do \- try on wedding dresses! I'll also say I did feel \*slightly\* guilty making an appointment and lying about being engaged and planning a wedding but I'm sure tons of people go for a fitting and never buy a dress so in the end it didn't bother me too much. I looked at the appointment times online before calling to make an appointment to make sure the staff knew I am a guy and the bridal appointment was for me and that it wouldn't be a problem and the woman on the phone was so calm and just brushed it off saying it wasn't an issue at all and my appointment was all set. Phew \- first hurdle jumped.

So when I get to the store, I check in and the girl at the desk takes me to the racks of dresses they have in the store, asked me if I had any ideas or visions and I said no not really, that I was trying to decide between a tux or a dress and I wanted to just try a bunch and see how it went. So I picked out a few dresses to try and she introduced me to the stylist, Alex, who was so sweet and helpful and who treated me just like any other customer. She hooked the back of the sample longline bra for me \(I wasn't planning on that, but she said they recommend it because it helps the dress fit better\) and obviously helped me in and out of all the dresses, talking about their fit, design, what makes them unique, and on and on.

It was one of the best experiences I've ever had! When I stepped out of the room and in front of the mirror in a beautiful ball gown my face lit up and so did Alex's! Other store employees walked by and commented how beautiful the dress was and they looked genuinely happy that I was there and enjoying myself. There were a few other customers in the store too which made me a little anxious, but even one of them said they loved one of the dresses I had one \- and it didn't even seem to phase anyone that I was obviously a guy. Alex even got me to twirl in one of the dresses because she said it looked so pretty when it twirled. Just thinking about this makes me giddy all over again lol!

It was so amazing to be able to just indulge myself and enjoy this ""rite of female passage"" that I never thought I'd be able to experience for myself. The supportiveness of the staff and their non\-chalant\-ness about a dude coming in to try on bridal gowns was such a huge experience for me and definitely helped me build confidence about expressing myself in more traditionally feminine ways. 

**tl;dr \- David's Bridal \(at least the one in Springfield, MA\) appears to be incredibly LGBTQ\+ friendly, not just for allowing me to come in and be fitted for a bridal gown but to have a stylist make it so comfortable and not awkward.

52,2018-05-08 20:33:20,8i01yn,5,9,"I've been rolling over this post in my head and attempting to write it for a few days days so I'm sorry if it's both overthought and also a little word dump because I'm just trying to say it without deleting this time. 

Quick summary \- I'm looking for ways to get confidence to make forward motion in my journey as well as talk to my husband. I need to know to explain dysphoria better and how to address his worry that I will solely present as or be male.

Background: I'm non\-binary and came to this conclusion two years ago after questioning my gender for a few decades \(way too stressful, do not recommend\). However, I have also been struggling for those two years to figure out how that is expressed. I have some pretty bad dysphoria mainly focused on breasts, voice, hair and period. The last is being taken care of by an IUD. My voice, I've thankfully recently found out that I just need to stop subconsciously raising my pitch around other people to sound more female. Breasts, I'm trying to decide if I just want to do a reduction because it's covered by my insurance and then use a binder/sports bra. Hair is then just a matter convincing myself to go through getting the cut I want to. 

I'm lucky in that there are a reasonable number of GNC/LBGT people where I work so I wouldn't stand out there but I'm struggling against the survival instinct to not draw attention to myself in the wider world. Am I OK taking things as slowly as I am? Do you think it's a mistake to just try jumping in on things like my hair that are easily reversible? 

My husband is someone I'm having problems talking about things with. Do you have any suggestions or resources on discussing dysphoria and being non\-binary? Somehow he is the straightest, most cis, person in my immediate family. I've discussed being non\-binary and my dysphoria with him. The problem is I keep feeling like he doesn't understand them. To start with it feels like he's confusing dysphoria with dysmorphia and tries to reassure me that I look good. Then he's oddly resistant to my desire to have much smaller/non\-existent breasts \(though he's in favor of my breasts getting reduced for my health\) and cutting my hair. He says he's worried about me having balance issues and that I'd be unhappy with the hairstyle I am looking at. I know he's worried that I'm going to be male or fully male presenting because of things he's said even though I've assured him that isn't the case \(I know that things like a voice as deep as my father or brother would also cause dysphoria for example\). Those all add up to me being uncertain I'm doing a good job explaining things.

Other than husband I've only talked about my gender with my brother and his spouse in the immediate family. They're both good with it and his spouse is masculine\-leaning non\-binary so it's good to talk with them. I'm actually not worried about talking with the rest of the family because it feels like they basically know but it could make it more awkward to tell them. And I say this because of things like my dad keeps suggesting I look at men's suits or tuxes and my mother telling me her goal was to raise her children in the least gendered way possible.

69,2018-05-11 09:14:26,8imdam,1,5,"My apologies in advance for a very long winded post, but here goes.

I came out back in 2011 and spent a lot of the time since then completely out. My family and friends are generally very supportive, which has made the process a lot easier. After I moved back home from college in 2016 I started having more trouble. While the area I live in is generally very progressive, it's not nearly as progressive as where I went to college. In addition I started teaching full time. In some ways, teachers can be very progressive, but culturally, the teaching field can be very culturally conservative and I have not been comfortable coming out to my colleagues. On top of that I recently moved in with a few strangers, and because I don't know anything about them or their background, I don't feel comfortable telling them the truth about my identity.

All this to say that I haven't been nearly as open about my pronouns/identity in the last couple years. 

I also work in theater, and generally I tend to be a little more vocal about pronoun preferences in those circles. In my initial emails to casts/designers/directors I almost always mention my pronouns, and I generally try to correct people when they get it wrong. On the most recent show that I worked on I noticed that slipping. 

I came into the process really late, after opening night in fact. I didn't know anyone in the cast and I guess I didn't want to make waves. I did have my pronouns in the signature of my initial email, and corrected a couple of actors on pronouns at first, but after a while I stopped. It seemed like not enough actors knew or cared and I was so exhausted from working two jobs that I almost didn't even have the energy to be upset? It wasn't like it didn't bother me, but I felt completely numb to my frustration.

On closing night I was talking to one of the actors and he approached me to apologize for misgendering me and using the wrong pronouns. He pointed out that he shouldn't have assumed my pronouns without asking me. What surprised me was that I found myself minimizing my frustration, both to myself and to him. At the time it didn't seem like a huge deal, but now I can't stop thinking about it. It made me wonder when I'd stopped standing up for myself, and it disturbed me to realize just how far back into the closet I've gone in the last year. I know I have the right to having people use the right pronouns\(at least cerebrally I know\), but at some point I stopped expecting it.

I feel like I'm losing myself and it honestly scares me. I don't know how to start being vocal about this stuff again and in the mean time I can feel myself turning inward, being less outgoing, and questioning whether I'm ""really"" genderqueer if my identity isn't acknowledged.

These are just my opinions, they relate to me and I use the terms and words to describe things as I've come to understand them. I recognize that my views are not consistent with most current opinion on the subjects, but I intend no offense and respect the right of others to have come to different conclusions. I just want to discuss these things.

I'm body-dysphoric FtM and gender non-conforming. I personally believe that body-dysphoric trans is a disorder of the mental making system of the brain, akin to BIID, and that this is why transition helps some of us. I believe social issues, specifically gender-binary expression expectations, are the other part of the problem.

My brain tells me that I should have a penis, and not having one causes me distress. I feel like I ""should be"" male, but this is where the issue comes into play. What does it mean to feel male? How do I, as a person born with healthy gynotypical physiology and socialized as female, know what I'm feeling *is* feeling ""male""?

I know that I don't ""feel female""... Or do I? 

How can I quantify these feelings? By what measure am I using to understand male and femaleness? How does a cisperson know they're cis? How much of what I think I feel is merely my brain trying to meet or subvert expectation? 

Feelings are too easily influenced. Things like the button test are almost laughable (if you asked me the button test about, for instance, turning into a vampire or werewolf, I'd probably smash it. That doesn't mean I'm really a vampire or werewolf deep down). Science nor psychology know the where what's and why's about gender and sex, cause or causality, everyone's guessing and the current zeitgeist is to just blindly accept subjective experience as law.

I can't get behind that. I want to be healthy, and authentically myself, but that doesn't mean throw away all outside opinion or critical thought. So in the interest of that, I'm here to ask for input, basically on anything I've said so far, whether you agree, partially agree and disagree, or fully disagree, please weigh in and tell me why you think what you do. Any sources would of course be appreciated, though I'd prefer a medical journal over Wikipedia, I'll take anything you got.

Through this, I've really come to understand how restrictive and reductive labels are, just by their very nature. That's just a personal belief of mine based on my own experience, and I was able to prove that to myself by taking off labels as they come up and really benefiting from it. I used to call myself Muslim, but I don't anymore. I still pray and fast and read the Quran, but I don't say I'm Muslim because I don't believe there's one definable cut and dry term for ""Muslim,"" it's too abstract of a concept.

I've since used the term genderqueer, and feel more authentic and comfortable. 

I still consider myself gay, and do not \(as many NB folks do\) prefer ""androsexual"" or some other inwardly\-genderneutral term for my orientation. This is partially because while I am non\-binary, I still consider myself very male. I don't have a desire for more specific terms like demiboy, or some other NB categorization of heavily\-present male  gender\-neutrality, but this is just how I am.

 Because I identify heavily with my masculine side, and I'm attracted exclusively to other males \(including transmasculine people\), I still use the term gay, and I find it accurate. 

My boyfriend \(who is cis, AMAB, and homosexual\) often reminds me whenever I ask him that my genderqueerness does not affect his adoration for me, which is really nice I guess. I think it may be because, as I said, I am ""mostly"" male, and express this way a lot. 

I guess I am just very self\-conscious about my identity, especially based on internalized comments from people who believe I'm not ""fully"" trans\*.

110,2018-05-19 16:20:53,8km9mi,10,13,"heyhey! I know you aren't my doctor or psychologist. I also know you can't tell me what gender I have or what my identity is. And writing this I don't know why I'm even writing you. maybe because I just really don't know who I could talk to instead, my family and friends would definitely not understand.

I'm Han/Hannah, afab, therefore offline known as Hannah, online(where no one knows me, like reddit,online games,etc) I'm Han. I'm 19 years old and 4 months ago i started questioning my gender again. 
I went through something similar when I was 15/16 years old. But I didn't know anything about gender, so I never even really started to think properly about it. I started binding (with sports bras because I didn't have anything else), only wore things that are considered masculine, tried to be like my brother (my brother started watching youtube-&gt;shortly after I did as well, he learned skateboard-&gt;I as well wanted to learn that,he started playing computer games-&gt;I did the same; you see the pattern). I ""borrowed"" his clothes which resulted in ""stealing"" them haha
I felt really insecure about myself, felt lonely, a huge black hole inside of me but with school stress and  everything I just didn't even realise those  things. Looking back I feel like that might have been a little depression. 

After that I guess I tried to fit in, wore ""normal"" clothes, still not hyper feminine but not things that made people look at me twice, stopped binding, even went to end of school ball in a dress (i was 18 then)

Now I'm in quite a similar situation in which I was at the age of 15 (19 now). My ""chest dysphoria"" (not even sure it is dysphoria though) has gotten really bad, I even started binding with bandages although I know how bad they are. It was just the only thing that could make me feel a little bit better about myself and make me leave the house these days. also I cut my hair short (finally!!) which I had been wanting to do for the past 4 years but didn't dare to because of negative comments by my mum and hair dresser. 
I really started questioning my gender, got into all the non binary stuff and felt like that was something that might fit. and then obviously I also stumbled upon all the people saying non binary is made up, for special snow flakes, blabla, and all these doubts again made me doubt my identity a lot. I went from labels like agender to trans masc back to just a cis female tomboy. 
one important point I find difficult to talk about is that I experienced a very bad sexual experience. I wouldn't call it abuse yet but I was definitely not happy and really really drunk in that situation. 

I looked up reasons for gender dysphoria and found that sexual abuse is one of them. One thing is, I did bind before that experience, it just got a lot worse afterwards. Isn't it strange that my dysphoria gets worse with my depressive time periods? or are these bad times actually caused by dysphoria?

all that makes me doubt my identity. also I just don't care about pronouns, neutral pronouns don't exist in my mother tongue (or better: they are just really complicated) and they don't make me feel any different. quite recently I got called ""he"" a few rare times, which really made me happy, but ""she"" doesn't make me feel uncomfortable. 

I was high and I saw myself as a granddad for a second. my dysphoria was basically gone in that short moment. it just felt real. 
I got drunk and the opposite happened. every few minutes I had to go to the bathroom, desperately staring at the reflection of my feminine body, trying to hide my chest, in my drunkness pushing it around to make it look smaller (obviously not very effective haha).

Right now my dysphoria is bearable, I just wear baggy clothes and no bra at all and that already helps enough. also I'm comfortable with my name Hannah, although I also like Han which is usually seen as a male name or not connected to any gender at all (although it technically even is a name for everbody)
when I look back at old pictures I don't see myself, sometimesl I'm forced into wearing skirts, which makes me incredibly uncomfortable (usually I can avoid it, thank god) and when I see myself like that it feels like a costume, like a stranger is staring back at me. I feel like that might be my way of dealing with stuff, just seeing it as a costume, not a part of who I am?

In connection to sexuality, I'm bi/pan (depending on your definition of the words). when talking to cis men I often feel uncomfortable because I feel like I'm pushed into the traditional ""woman stereotype"" when talking to a person of any other gender I feel like I can just express who I am without these stupid gender roles that society pushes on us. 

Which makes me question, am I just a cis woman that hates gender roles? Or is there really something wrong with my gender. 

For the last months I've been writing down whether I would consider top surgery or going on testosterone and first I guess I had to get used to the thoughts, for top surgery the answer quite quickly changed to yes definitely, for t I was wondering if I really needed the effects. I guess I would be happier with a slightly deeper voice and maybe a different more masculine facial bone structure, I'm not too sure about facial hair though and feel like I could achieve the voice change with voice training as well. 

Also I'm unsure because of the ""I knew it all my life"" stories and that I was quite happy as a child. I did grow up in quite a gender neutral environment but even in the gendered things I did not feel uncomfortable. I did wear dresses as a child and only when puberty hit and I started growing up I didn't like these things anymore.

It's all just a mess. I can't see a psychotherapist right now because I live abroad for another 3 months and then move back to Germany, I've tried talking to a ton of different people online and it literally has confused me even more most of the time. I just don't know what to do anymore. 
I try to just live without thinking about it, just being myself, but my thoughts always come back to it. Someone just has to consider me a girl/woman and mention it and I'm thinking again. 

I don't even know why I'm writing you all this, maybe you still feel like answering, if not that's perfectly fine. 
Thank you for reading all this mess of thoughts

How in the world am I supposed to choose a label for my gender!?

I'm afab, but even when I was a kid I knew I didn't fully fit femininity. Mentally, I always thought I was more masculine, and I frequently would get frustrated that my mental state wasn't reflected in my physical state. The past few years I've started embracing my androgynous side much more and I'm totally loving it, but if anyone asked I would still tell them I'm a woman. This bothers me; I don't feel completely female, nor do I feel completely male. Some days I feel differently than others, which makes me think I might be more genderfluid. However, there are SO MANY labels to choose from that also seem to resonate with me, and I'm having a really tough time narrowing them down.

Mentally, I always thought I was more masculine, and I frequently would get frustrated that my mental state wasn't reflected in my physical state. The past few years I've started embracing my androgynous side much more and I'm totally loving it, but if anyone asked I would still tell them I'm a woman. This bothers me; I don't feel completely female, nor do I feel completely male. Some days I feel differently than others, which makes me think I might be more genderfluid. However, there are SO MANY labels to choose from that also seem to resonate with me, and I'm having a really tough time narrowing them down.

Statement: There are more than two genders.

Rebuttal: There are only two.  People are born with either XX chromosomes or XY chromosomes.

Counterargument: No there aren't. Intersex people exist. Some people are not even born with XX or XY Chromosones and some \(Chimeras\) are born with both.

Rebuttal: Those only account for a small part of the population. The vast majority of people who identify as a third gender were born either male or female. They were not born intersex. Calling someone something different doesn't change their biological reality.

Counterargument: Certain people have a certain genotype but their phenotype may present as something else entirely. People with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome for example have XY chromosomes, but everyone by observing them as they go through life would recognize them as female.  


Rebuttal: Again intersex people are a small section of the population. They are biological accidents, outliers to the general rule. Intersex people may call themselves a third gender but people who were born not intersex cannot. They cannot change the fact that they were born male or female.  


Counterargument: Gender refers to the social rules attached to biological sex. There can be nonbinary genders because there are people who don't conform to the social rules attached to either biological sex and don't identify with being either male or female.  


Rebuttal : Gender roles don't exist. I don't conform to gender roles in \_\_\_ , \_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_ way. I know many people who don't conform to gender roles.   


Counterargument: Go down on the street. You will notice that the vast majority of men have shorter than chin\-length hair. You will notice the vast majority of women have longer than chin\-length hair. If you are guy, your chances of success are much lower if you into a finance or law or customer service interview wearing a dress.  Of course gender roles exist. They are everywhere. \(I already feel dragged through the mud here\).  


Rebuttal: Gender roles don't exist. We are all just human. You are just exacerbating a problem by creating more genders when all these artificial rules on gender are bullshit. There are still mainly two biological genders, male and female, with very limited exceptions. Also, the majority of men and women have different hair lengths and clothing options because they want to, not because they are forced to. Clothes and fashion aren't important.  


Counterargument: If you want to go abolish gender roles, go create an organization. All nonbinary people want to do is live their lives in the way they choose. Nonbinary genders help them do live their life and articulate who they are. Nonbinary people don't exist to solve the world's gender problems. If you want to do that, put your skin in the game.

My name is Piszé Szőke.
It's not my ""official"" name, I just played with letters and got Piszé. Szőke means Blonde.

I'm 21 years old.

You can see, I hope not, but I think you see it, I am not too good at english. (I have to admit I don't really care.)
I studied it, used it, but I live in Hungary, and I can't really practice. 

I rarely use Reddit, it's easier to use Messenger when I don't have too much time, and I just prefer Facebook.

I'm looking for peoples to talk with, I am interested in politics, how can I say vallás in english...
Religion! Spirituality.
Cats, dogs, fishes.
Clothes.

I am engaged, not looking for, not interested in love, or sex, nothing like that.

I only listen to a few female artists music, Tina Turner, Bonnie Tyler.
We don't have to agree in anything.

So here is my Facebook profile and a picture of me.
I can't attach picture and write my monologue in the same post.

9,2018-05-04 01:55:25,8gvpys,1,1,"First of all I understand no one can answer that question for me and it has been long since I bothered about in which category my sexuality and gender fit. I just need to hear some other opinions and experiences. I decided to post here since how I feel about it has always been fluid in some way, though mostly I thought I was simply 'atypical male'.

**Backstory**\(**feel free to skip****\)**: So I am 23 AMAB and until I was 18 I never thought about gender. There were a few small signs before like other boys not making sense to me \(and they still don't\). I never had my style when it comes to clothing, no interest in male fashion, so I just let my parents pick. I NEVER felt connected \(to this day\) with my body and my looks, I barely knew how I look in the mirror and never understood how can people feel good about their looks.

Things changed when my depression started, but I made some new friends and realized I really am way more'natural' when hanging out with girls and also that I would cross\-dress. As it progressed I felt at one point I really didn't know which gender I was, and later there were times I hated my whole male body, even more because it made people simply assume I am a man \(I still wish they wouldn't\). But I ended up accepting I am just 'atypical' male with crossdressing wish. I got better after 3y, gained some confidence, self\-respect and autonomy. I thought all before was just some self\-hate and reconnecting with my ""feamle side"".

**The thing is:** I am not sure if I feel good alone with myself, or just with some things I do. I still try to look more feminine \(without being too obvious\) and it can really get me so happy but sometimes I notice my male face and I just think I look like an idiot. But it changes with my mood, if it's good I can be satisfied with little things and carry on as a male, when it's great I feel like trying out more, but when it's bad I get really sensitive about it and just wish I looked so much more feminine. I don't know if it's some kind of defense mechanism? Also when bad, my dreams \(very vivid\) about looking really feminine are more often, and I feel by a magnitude  better even days after them.

Lately it got bad, I lost some friends, but I also further questioned how others treat me and realized how much I still feel surpressed. I realized I often feel like a doll that someone can treat, use and dress how they want. It has to do with my boundaries and being passive, but also with my parents. Living with them I feel like ""I can't express myself""\(incl. being more feminine\)\- even though I don't have other problems than them not realizing I am grownup. I so want to get to live alone to the point of not wanting to live at all if I don't do it this year. And yet I am constantly sabotaging myself in that plan like I don't care about myself, I only look for distractions so I don't feel anything when alone.

And then there was a dream again about being female, but this time in it I told people to call me Juno and they did. I never thought about changing name but this one stuck sooo much with me, I felt so much better just calling myself Juno and like I kept wanting to be that person in my dream. But then I got very anxious, I don't hate myself like I used to but I still feel like somethings very wrong with me. Or I get frustrated and angry. Yesterday night my body felt like all needles. Then I feel scared about changing my look, I am not sure if how I feel about myself is actually 'bad' or just 'acceptable' and I am not sure I could wake up tomorrow and be a woman or how am I suppoused to feel then? I don't know if I just run away from my problems/myself by wanting to be a different gender, did I convince myself it is some sort of dysphoria?After all I've been fooling and surpressing myself before.

So that said, here's my name story.

Originally, I was assigned male at birth, and never questioned my assigned [male-first-name] [male-middle-name/father's-first-name] [father's-last-name] name. However, as I matured, I began to feel like my name was the wrong name, and sought a new one but never knew what it should be.

Then, finally, during a religious vow of silence, I discovered on the first day that my first name was *Christopher*, and went by that in my pen-and-paper-aided communications for the remainder of the vow.

Interestingly, my gender then flipped to to female during the vow (holy shit!), and I ended the vow on the evening of the ninth day after unintentionally saying the *female* name out loud, *Christy*.

I've since gone by both names, depending upon which gender role I was occupying, for example, Christopher at work and in legal situations, and Christy at home and with friends.

On the form I had to fill out to file for a name change, the following prompt was given:

---

[Explain here why you want to change your name.]

The reasons for this name change are as follows:____

---

Here is what I wrote:

---

As of Spring of 2016, I no longer go by [deadname] at all, and additionally I identify not as my birth-assigned gender of male, but as bigender.

Since then, I go by two other names, Christopher or Christy, depending upon which gender role I am occupying in a particular social circle.

I have chosen to make my legal first name to be Christopher because I have already been going by Christopher as early as age four, in the form of my nickname, Christopher Robin.

I have chosen to make my legal middle name to be Christy because that is the only place left to include it in my legal name.

40,2018-05-12 05:36:26,8iu3f1,3,3,"My name is Zairen and I'm a 19 year old genderfluid college student in Minnesota. I was assigned male at birth with the name Zachary. I've only recently come out to more of my friends but not to my family yet. I struggle with what is most likely depression and stress problems on a daily basis. I also deal with constant intrusive thoughts that range of self mockery to self harm and even suicide. I have a large problem with call of the void whenever doing something dangerous or has the potential for danger. When driving a vehicle there is constant thoughts just to swerve my car into an oncoming vehicle or somekind of building or pole. While I really don't have the urge myself to die it has become hard sometimes to seperate what thoughts are mine. On the outside to anyone that doesn't know what I'm going through I appear perfectly fine if not just a little somber. Even getting up is a struggle for me. It takes a good 2 to 3 hours before Im actually up. Doing homework is especially a struggle. I always have a little voice in the back of my head telling me that I should just give up and to quit. A lot of times I do end up listening to this voice and it hurts a lot. Because of my mental state happiness is a momentary situation backed by sadness and depression. The joy someone would get from their birthday or some other kind of positive event lasts maybe a few hours at best. Every moment is filled with self doubt and self hatred. Even when my best friends in the world do something positive for me I always have the suspicion that they are only doing it to appear for my own sake instead of out of actual kindness. Under the same train of thought I always think I'm some kind of burden upon those around me. I'm hyper aware of the way people percieve me and my presence to the point that I assume people automatically dislike my presence.

For me my gender identity is a curse and a blessing compared to many in the LGBT community. As a cis-passing person I don't have to worry about any kind of discrimination unless I make it publicly known what my gender identity is. I'm also lucky that as a genderfluid my disphoria is relatively small compared to other people. However, my identity is also a curse. Because of the fact that I can pass without out any work as a cis-male and I'm not ""fully trans"" acceptance by those in the LGBT community is difficult. I often feel like my identity isnt legitimate and that I'm appropriating the culture of those that have struggled more than I have.

I wish I was able to list positive things about myself but I somehow lack this ability. When trying to do so I automatically shun myself for being narcacisstic. With any kind of positive thought I find something negative to replace it with. Did good on a paper? THen I have to remind myself that I hate my body or that I'm some kind of failure that doesn't have a passion for anything. This lack of passion for anything is quite true though. I hold little passion or care for anything besides others. When it comes to careers or myself its next to impossible to make myself care. I could be someone's shoulder to cry on and be able to help solve their problems but I can barely drag myself to class or see a therapist. When I look at myself in the mirror I see a fat, short, dumb, ginger boy. When I look at myself I see failure, disappointment, and a waste of life. Despite not wanting to die I care very little for my well being beyond eating and bathing.

During all of this my biggest help was been my boss and friend Carter. They have helped me figure out and become comfortable with my identity. Carter is one of the few if not the only person I feel comfortable talking about anything personal with anymore. I can't talk to my parents about anything and Im terrified of other authority figures whether it be teachers, assistants, or therapists. This why I'm terrified of not being able to continue going to Morris. If can't come anymore I won't have a rock anymore. While my other friends have been accepting of my identity they either don't understand or can't relate fully. If I go to ARCC than I won't have this kind of community. If I stay at home then all I have to look forward to is verbal bullying by my parents, working constantly, and stayig in my room for the rest of the time. I may have the possibility of seeing a counselor but what good does that bring me when I have to go right back to the home which causes me so much stress and anxiety. At home I have little reason to exist or be a person. During high school I would next to always be in my room paying video games. Asking to see friends was not a right but a privelge. Of course that was when I was still in high school and not a legal adult. But now that I can be my own person with a few calls to declare myself independent why am I so terrified? Why don't I struggle with the idea of leaving the people that tried to raise a genius child that only grew up to disappoint them? Why I am I afraid to leave the home that mocked me for my anxiety issues when I was afraid the world was going to end. Why am I afraid to leave the home which I can't even associate any positive memoryies, a home that is just a house and nothing more, not even a real home. Why do I blame myself for all of this? Have I been lazy a bunch when it comes to solving my problems? Of course, but I shouldn't be afraid of just talking to someone that is wanting and willing to help. My parents are not the sole reason for this happening. Society at large played just as big of a role in me becoming the weak person I am if not bigger. But where were my parents during all of this trying to help me? Whenever I got bad grades in school they would constantly ask why I wasn't asking anyone for help. My answer was always I don't know which wasn't acceptable but I always knew deep down was that it was because I was afraid. In my sophmore year of highschool I finally decided to tell my parents the truth about a bad grade and that I needed help. My father was acepting but of course he had to tell my mother. as soon as I could hear her feeting pounding up the stairs I knew I wasn't going to be asking for help again. I was told to get out my spanish homework and to sit at the table. As soon as I did I was met with a hard slap against the back of the head which made my face fly towards the table. As I was crying my mother berated me for being a moron and that I wasn't going to amount to anything. This was not the only time this happened, in fact, it happened many times throughout my life. The one that sticks with me the most was when my parents found out about my last report card in senior year. I had dropped and failed a class in pseo because of stress and not knowing how to get help. As soon as they saw it I was hit in the face and knocked out of the chair I was sitting in. The same one I had been hit in during my sophmore year. I was told to stand up and when I did I was met with the same kind of verbal abuse I've been hit with before. What was different about this time was the physicality I faced. Instead of just the usual slaps I was met with punches to the body and kicks to the legs that were thrown with enough force that I ended up on the ground in tears. This is no where representative of the normal state of the household. Normally thingd go on just fine without a hitch but there was always an underlying feeling of tension ad uneasiness. What made the house particularily bad were the bad times. There were no different levels of anger, it was either a 0 or a 10 nothing inbetween. My parents were my own bullies. Everything I did was used against me whether it be my acne, my weight, or the people I associated with. I was simply never good enough. 

This behavior at home transfered heavily in school. I lacked any confidence in anything I was doing and hated people that were even slighty better than me. I learned quickly that the only was I would make it through school was being invisible and making as little of a splash as possible. I didn't want people to know me or be friends with me. I wanted to sit alone in silence at lunch and disappear into the sea of people and be nothing with everything. At the same time I began to question my gender identity which made me want to hide even more as I didn't even understand myself at that point. What made this especially worse is that I grew up in a heavily conservative area where people were both openly homophobic and transphobic. I thought I was less than human, a monster if anything. this is where my intrusive thoughts began. On a constant basis my mind was swarming itself that it was worthless and didn't deserve to live. If I had lived in a different household I could have gone to my parents for help and acceptance and I would have been in a way better place than I would be now. But instead I know I would have been openly mocked. Only a few years prior I had deceloped a strong fear of the world ending at the end of the Mayan calendar. Was it silly? definelty, but I was terrified. I struggled with sleeping and eating to the point it started affecting my grades. I eventually started seeing a counselor at school but soon stopped when my parents found out and began mocking me for it and acting as if I done someting wrong. If I couldn't trust my parents with bad grades or a silly little fear like that how could I ever trust them with me struggling with my self-worth and gender indentity? I couldn't and I still can't. There is one small and mundane memory from my childhood that eerily relates to all of this. I remeber sitting at Costco with my parents eating lunch after we had finished shopping. I dont remember what we were talking about but I can remember like it was yesterday turning to my mother and saying ""I don't have any self confidence"" while this was true even when I was very young I shouldn't have been thinking this way but what I shouldn't have gotten in response but did anyways was the short phrase from my mother ""No you don't, and thats your fault."" This is the person that Zairen is. This is the person I am. This is why I am the way I am. While people have struggled much more than I have much of this is my own fault for not standing up for myself its the way it is. However, this is not the person I want to be. I want to become a better person for myself and I want to prove my family wrong. I want to be stronger and more confident. I want to be able to stand up for and teach the next generation of people dealing with the same stuff I've had to deal with.

I\'m also lucky that as a genderfluid my disphoria is relatively small compared to other people. However, my identity is also a curse. Because of the fact that I can pass without out any work as a cis-male and I\'m not ""fully trans"" acceptance by those in the LGBT community is difficult. I often feel like my identity isnt legitimate and that I\'m appropriating the culture of those that have struggled more than I have.\n\nI wish I was able to list positive things about myself but I somehow lack this ability. When trying to do so I automatically shun myself for being narcacisstic. With any kind of positive thought I find something negative to replace it with. Did good on a paper? THen I have to remind myself that I hate my body or that I\'m some kind of failure that doesn\'t have a passion for anything. This lack of passion for anything is quite true though. I hold little passion or care for anything besides others. When it comes to careers or myself its next to impossible to make myself care. I could be someone\'s shoulder to cry on and be able to help solve their problems but I can barely drag myself to class or see a therapist. When I look at myself in the mirror I see a fat, short, dumb, ginger boy. When I look at myself I see failure, disappointment, and a waste of life. Despite not wanting to die I care very little for my well being beyond eating and bathing.\n\nDuring all of this my biggest help was been my boss and friend Carter. They have helped me figure out and become comfortable with my identity. Carter is one of the few if not the only person I feel comfortable talking about anything personal with anymore. I can\'t talk to my parents about anything and Im terrified of other authority figures whether it be teachers, assistants, or therapists. This why I\'m terrified of not being able to continue going to Morris. If can\'t come anymore I won\'t have a rock anymore. While my other friends have been accepting of my identity they either don\'t understand or can\'t relate fully. If I go to ARCC than I won\'t have this kind of community. If I stay at home then all I have to look forward to is verbal bullying by my parents, working constantly, and stayig in my room for the rest of the time. I may have the possibility of seeing a counselor but what good does that bring me when I have to go right back to the home which causes me so much stress and anxiety. At home I have little reason to exist or be a person. During high school I would next to always be in my room paying video games. Asking to see friends was not a right but a privelge. Of course that was when I was still in high school and not a legal adult. But now that I can be my own person with a few calls to declare myself independent why am I so terrified? Why don\'t I struggle with the idea of leaving the people that tried to raise a genius child that only grew up to disappoint them? Why I am I afraid to leave the home that mocked me for my anxiety issues when I was afraid the world was going to end. Why am I afraid to leave the home which I can\'t even associate any positive memoryies, a home that is just a house and nothing more, not even a real home. Why do I blame myself for all of this? Have I been lazy a bunch when it comes to solving my problems? Of course, but I shouldn\'t be afraid of just talking to someone that is wanting and willing to help. My parents are not the sole reason for this happening. Society at large played just as big of a role in me becoming the weak person I am if not bigger. But where were my parents during all of this trying to help me? Whenever I got bad grades in school they would constantly ask why I wasn\'t asking anyone for help. My answer was always I don\'t know which wasn\'t acceptable but I always knew deep down was that it was because I was afraid. In my sophmore year of highschool I finally decided to tell my parents the truth about a bad grade and that I needed help. My father was acepting but of course he had to tell my mother. as soon as I could hear her feeting pounding up the stairs I knew I wasn\'t going to be asking for help again. I was told to get out my spanish homework and to sit at the table. As soon as I did I was met with a hard slap against the back of the head which made my face fly towards the table. As I was crying my mother berated me for being a moron and that I wasn\'t going to amount to anything. This was not the only time this happened, in fact, it happened many times throughout my life. The one that sticks with me the most was when my parents found out about my last report card in senior year. I had dropped and failed a class in pseo because of stress and not knowing how to get help. As soon as they saw it I was hit in the face and knocked out of the chair I was sitting in. The same one I had been hit in during my sophmore year. I was told to stand up and when I did I was met with the same kind of verbal abuse I\'ve been hit with before. What was different about this time was the physicality I faced. Instead of just the usual slaps I was met with punches to the body and kicks to the legs that were thrown with enough force that I ended up on the ground in tears. This is no where representative of the normal state of the household. Normally thingd go on just fine without a hitch but there was always an underlying feeling of tension ad uneasiness. What made the house particularily bad were the bad times. There were no different levels of anger, it was either a 0 or a 10 nothing inbetween. My parents were my own bullies. Everything I did was used against me whether it be my acne, my weight, or the people I associated with. I was simply never good enough. \n\nThis behavior at home transfered heavily in school. I lacked any confidence in anything I was doing and hated people that were even slighty better than me. I learned quickly that the only was I would make it through school was being invisible and making as little of a splash as possible. I didn\'t want people to know me or be friends with me. I wanted to sit alone in silence at lunch and disappear into the sea of people and be nothing with everything. At the same time I began to question my gender identity which made me want to hide even more as I didn\'t even understand myself at that point. What made this especially worse is that I grew up in a heavily conservative area where people were both openly homophobic and transphobic. I thought I was less than human, a monster if anything. this is where my intrusive thoughts began. On a constant basis my mind was swarming itself that it was worthless and didn\'t deserve to live. If I had lived in a different household I could have gone to my parents for help and acceptance and I would have been in a way better place than I would be now. But instead I know I would have been openly mocked. Only a few years prior I had deceloped a strong fear of the world ending at the end of the Mayan calendar. Was it silly? definelty, but I was terrified. I struggled with sleeping and eating to the point it started affecting my grades. I eventually started seeing a counselor at school but soon stopped when my parents found out and began mocking me for it and acting as if I done someting wrong. If I couldn\'t trust my parents with bad grades or a silly little fear like that how could I ever trust them with me struggling with my self-worth and gender indentity? I couldn\'t and I still can\'t. There is one small and mundane memory from my childhood that eerily relates to all of this. I remeber sitting at Costco with my parents eating lunch after we had finished shopping. I dont remember what we were talking about but I can remember like it was yesterday turning to my mother and saying ""I don\'t have any self confidence"" while this was true even when I was very young I shouldn\'t have been thinking this way but what I shouldn\'t have gotten in response but did anyways was the short phrase from my mother ""No you don\'t, and thats your fault."" This is the person that Zairen is. This is the person I am. This is why I am the way I am. While people have struggled much more than I have much of this is my own fault for not standing up for myself its the way it is. However, this is not the person I want to be. I want to become a better person for myself and I want to prove my family wrong. I want to be stronger and more confident. I want to be able to stand up for and teach the next generation of people dealing with the same stuff I\'ve had to deal with. I want to make sure that one day no one will have to go though the same stuff I did.

I'm trying to figure out what to call myself and what to ask others to call me. I'm coming out in a very supportive community and I have a supportive partner. 

Background:
37 AMAB, broke through some fear walls in my head about a week ago and still picking up the pieces. Moving between she/her and they/them with occasional fits of he/him in my head self-gendering. I seem to have very little control over this. 
&lt;/background&gt;


I've been going by Hal for most of my life and, so far, it's felt OK to keep going by it. It's uncommon enough to not feel tied to a thousand other representations of it. The only major Pop culture version of my name is the computer from 2001: A Space Odyssey and, while HAL has a masculine voice, they are just a glowing red eye and action wise don't tend to skew one gender or another. Also, I'm a programming teacher with an active interest in AI so that helps me stay attached to the name.

My name at birth is Halsted -- an old family name. It came from my great-grandfather and the only other person I've ever heard of having the name is a woman in San Francisco. I really like and respect the history and care associated with picking my name, but I also feel some distance from it.

I've been trying on the name Hallie recently socially. When my folks asked my great grandfather if they could name me after him, he told them that yes, but only if noone called me Hallie because, and I quote, ""That's a girl's name."" When I was a kid, I had strong negative reactions be being called Howie or Hallie at least in part as a result of knowing this info.

I now kindof feel like reclaiming it, and it feels good to wear. It also feels somewhat gendered f but not overly so. How does it hit other folk in their intuitive sense?


I'm afraid:
1) That I'll hate it a month after I get everyone calling me that
2) I'll end up feeling too distant from my self and end up creating traumatic rifts in my self-id that I'll need to heal later
3) It will feel right when I feel she/her and not when I feel they/them - he/himish and I'll end up confusing the crap out of everyone around me if I'm feeling different genders over the course of a day. Also, is this a thing?

Here are 3 from me: 

I am thankful for my health, because it opens endless possibilities for jobs, travel, and fun activities. 

I am thankful for my life partner, who grounds and supports me, no matter how batshit off the wall I go. I don't know If I will ever meet a person as brutally honest and patient as him again. He's always my support and strength.
:) 


I am thankful for the financial abundance in my life. I have a steady paycheck that takes care of my expenses, food, etc. 
I am blessed to be among those who aren't drowning in expenses and debts at the end of each month. We live paycheck to paycheck, but all of our needs and some basic wants sre always taken care of. :)

They didn't really say anything, just changed the topic back to the pizza after a short pause. But that's the first time I've come out to anyone fully outside of my family and a very few fellow gays and queers I know.

but i how about your ego - if you really don't care about what somebody thinks then you would dress how the hell you would like and present yourself in any way that took your fancy. such as naked, filthy, dressed in a sheet. 

so there it is - its about ego and how we want others to react to us. we want others to react to us in a way that aligns with our expectations. so if we feel that a bit of male banter is expected, then if we behave in a way that elicits male banter, then we might expect to get it. if we don't, we might feel that we should dress a bit more masculine in order elicit that feeling.
Or perhaps we might hope that females would be more comfortable around us and trust us a little more if we are a little more feminine as we ourselves don't feel that combative Male behaviour to be valuable.

So its about social interaction because without any other humans, we really dont feel these social related feelings. If i were deserted on an island with no human contact its unlikely i would get turned on dressing like a cute little cosplay vixen. unless i drew on memories of society. (an island of cosplay vixens isn't such a bad thought to dwell on)...

But im not, im living in a fucking complex society and its feeling difficult to make sense of it. i just know that if i dress in a way that in compelled to (leafing through my wifes wardrobe) i will find my day rather difficult.
