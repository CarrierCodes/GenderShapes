9,2018-03-01 17:42:35,8173lj,8,13,"Hello /r/NonBinary,

It's a long story, but I think that I may be one of you.  Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.  Maybe I'm something else.

If I am, I am not properly ""out"" to anyone.  There are a lot of haters in my family, and coming out could be dangerous. (but I'm sure it is for most anyone)

Anyhow, I'd like to tell you a little about myself.  (I previously wrote this if you want to read more about me: https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/80fqhd/not_sure_what_i_am_what_do_you_think/)

I've always been a bit odd and I've never fit it very well.  As a child, I was diagnosed with ADHD, but as an adult with access to better information, it's clear to me that I am high-functioning autistic.  I used to fear that I would grow old alone and without family and friends, but I was super lucky to meet a wonderful lady who learned to love me the way I am (mostly) and she became my wife and the mother of my child.  I love her dearly.

I think it is relevant that I have always been exclusively attracted to women sexually and I am deeply committed to my monogamous marriage.

I've always thought of myself as a guy.  However, I sometimes feel urges to behave femininely, and sometimes I wish I could appear more feminine.  (I've actually been chastised by closed-minded family members for this)  I wrote in the thread I linked above that I sometimes feel what I would describe as an unhealthy envy of women's bodies, which I suspect is related to sexual health issues and possibly influenced by pornography.  I was disappointed to read that it typically costs over 10,000 USD for a man to have his beard permanently removed.

I spoke to my wife about my interest in cross-dressing as a sexual fetish.  She was rather put off by it.  She made some remark that she was afraid of me turning into Caitlyn Jenner.  I do not see myself being like Caitlyn.  The way I would explain that is that Caitlyn is a trans-woman.  She identifies herself as a women.  I see myself identifying as someone who has a female identity alongside my male identity.  I can't see myself ceasing to identify with my masculine roles of husband and father.  Being a father means the world to me.  Still, my wife made it very clear to me that she cannot be married to a woman.  She said that if I become a woman, ""we can be friends"".  Perish the thought!  I do not want my child raised without myself as the father.

So what about clothes?  Without my wife's knowledge, I ordered a pair of tunic dresses online.  They arrived yesterday.  I wanted to keep this to myself.  The delivery came while my wife was giving the child a nap.  Feeling a sense of shame that I was hiding something, I stuck a note on the door: ""no doorbell, please"".  The package arrived during the nap and I carefully discarded the note and stuck the package in the back of a filing cabinet.  I tried on the dresses after my wife and child had retired for the night.

I really hate that I'm keeping this secret.  I just don't know how I can explain this to my wife and what she'll think.

I enjoyed trying on my new clothes, but I felt sad that at least for now, I can only wear them by myself.  One of my dresses is a pleated dress with a floral print.  It fits me very well and helps fill my urge to appear feminine (not that I feel the need to appear feminine 24/7)

One thing I really love about this dress is that with its long sleeves, I can wear it with leggings and cover up almost 100% of my masculine body hair.  I think that my muscles would also look ridiculous sticking out of a sleeveless dress.  Trying to look androgynous is not for the faint of heart!  I feel like I'm actually rather smart about this!  I also like the fact that the pleats tend to conceal my masculine spare tire and my novice tucking job.  It's actually about perfect for an AMAB non-binary!

The other thing that bugs me is this:  My wife used to tease me for being girly.  I used to take it in stride.  I thought that it was a ""shit test"" that I had become very comfortable with passing.  One day, I said to her, ""You know, I think you're on to something.  I think that there is a girly side to me, and from now on, I won't hold back from feeling it and expressing it.""  She never teased me that way again.  I feel wistful thinking about it.

Another thing is that I've finally acted on my urge to grow my hair out.  It's about 3 inches long and very curly.  Family and friends have always urged me to keep it short because they think it looks handsome and manly that way.

See, if I were a trans-woman, I suspect I would be wanting to taking female hormones and present as a woman 100% of the time, but that isn't who I am.  But at the same time, I feel stifled by not being able to express myself femininely in demeanour and appearance.  So, I suspect that I might fall into some sort of non-binary category.  Hence, I suspect that I am one of you.

My top concern right now is that I want to feel comfortable in my own skin, and I don't want to become something that my wife doesn't want anymore.  I think she should be able to accept me as non-binary, but I don't know how to explain it to her.",NonBinary,"AMAB, new here... I think I may be one of you.

I decided I was gay when I was around 10 and changed that to queer a few years ago ‚Äî partly because I realized not everyone I'm attracted to identified as a man and partly because I felt increasingly alienated from mainstream cis gay men. I'm not entirely sure when I first began to wonder if I'm not a cis man myself but I began to consider the question in earnest a few months ago. I found the possibility surprisingly exciting and there seemed to be ample evidence.

Some examples of that evidence: - I've never felt very comfortable in designated male spaces (locker rooms, men's bathrooms, etc.) and I've never particularly enjoyed being considered ""one of the guys"" as it seemed an awkward fit. - At High School, all my friends were women (though as an adult it's been all gay men) and I've always hated sports and recoiled from traditionally masculine behavior. - In recent years, I've grown increasingly bored with much of the clothing marketed to men; it's often repetitively styled, limited to plain colors and patterns, and generally downright boring. I've been searching out more color, florals, and unusual patterns to the point of incorporating some ""women's"" clothing into my wardrobe. - For a while now I've found myself fantasizing about living in a society with indigenous/precolonized gender roles because then I could ""just have a sensible third gender.""

For most of my life, I've packed a lot of that into the gay identity but as I got older and ""gay"" began to be more clearly differentiated as strictly a sexual orientation I've wondered where that left my gender nonconforming behavior. I got by with ""queer"" for a while. But then something changed.

One drunken weekend night about a month ago, I shared with my husband that I wondered if I wasn't some flavor of nonbinary. The next day I thought about how I'd blame the booze and walk that back...and then I didn't. Instead, I told more people, and began actively exploring the possibility. The results have been encouraging. I bought more clothing marketed to women and started finding opportunities to wear more gender-mixed attire. I reopened my ear piercings from my 20s and started wearing all kinds of earrings. I've spent so much at Sephora, I've probably put them into the black for the year. I've been enjoying the hell out of all of this. I really like when my appearance feels like a mashup of different gender expressions. I've started having little moments of unexpected delight, like when I see my lipstick imprint on a glass of wine. Once when I came home from work and stripped off my traditionally-male work clothes, I somehow felt better just being naked.

I just noticed that comparing with my friend I don't feel that comfortable being a woman as her. There was kind of a part that wasn't male nor female. Before that I identified as a girl but never thought about it much. I came out as bi/pan last summer and got more into the local queer community and got to know some nb people. Since then my gender questioning got worse. 

Everytime we did an introduction round in queer circles with pronouns, mostly it felt wrong to use 'she'. When I needed to choose my gender in formulars, sometimes I don't want to tick the woman box. I feel most comfortable in sweater and jeans, but sometimes I also like skirts and dresses. Also I got into button-up shirts (and felt as if I look like a lesbian stereotype first). Recently I cut my hair short and I feel so much more like me. I never imagined that would be possible with short hair (it was pretty spontaneous). I like to present androgynous (except my face is really soft), but as soon as I look too masculine, it doesn't feel right. Also I don't like it to be mistaken a guy. But I also feel an aversion when someone calls me Miss whatever.

Also I would like to rip out my uterus, not just because bad cramps but it doesn't feel as a part of me. On the other side I'm pretty much fine with my outer genitalia.

32,2018-03-04 04:09:44,81vh1b,8,18,"A long, long time ago, to be specific, two days ago, I posted my musings that I suspect that I am one of you. (https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/8173lj)  This conversation and others have convinced me that I am non-binary in some way, and now I feel the need to tell others about what I feel.

To start out with, I need to be out with my wife, because one of the strongest indications of my non-binary identity is my frequent urge to wear feminine clothes (but I am certain that this is about more than clothes).  If I'm not out with her, my girl clothes are going to be sitting in the back of my filing cabinet with my tax papers until the day I drop dead.

I previously wrote that my wife expressed apprehension that I might be a trans-woman and said to me very clearly that she could not be married to me if that's what I am.

So, the first thing that came to mind is the fear that she might give me an ultimatum to either dress, act, and identify as a cisgender male for the rest of my life or have a divorce and become an ""Uncle Dad"", writing a monthly check to her and seeing my child every other weekend.

I don't think that the above is the likely outcome.  I think my coming out is likely to come as a shock to her, but I don't think she'd leave me or give me an ultimatum.

However... There is something else that I'm afraid of.  As many of you probably did when you first discovered that you were non-binary, I feel like I don't know exactly how to express myself as non-binary, and some experimentation is in order.  I'm afraid that such experimentation will be heavily censured and stifled.

I fear that she'll have a mindset (even perhaps being unaware of it) that will cause her to exert very strong pressure to conform to a traditional cisgender role upon me.  She might urge me to give up shaving body hair because I've been having trouble with ingrown hairs (yuck!)  She might steer me away from situations where I might express myself femininely.  She might tell our 3 year old that Daddy is going thru a phase.  She might frequently make comments about how nice my hair looks shorter.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/NonBinary/comments/8173lj)  This conversation and others have convinced me that I am non-binary in some way, and now I feel the need to tell others about what I feel.\n\nTo start out with, I need to be out with my wife, because one of the strongest indications of my non-binary identity is my frequent urge to wear feminine clothes (but I am certain that this is about more than clothes).  If I\'m not out with her, my girl clothes are going to be sitting in the back of my filing cabinet with my tax papers until the day I drop dead.\n\nI previously wrote that my wife expressed apprehension that I might be a trans-woman and said to me very clearly that she could not be married to me if that\'s what I am.\n\nSo, the first thing that came to mind is the fear that she might give me an ultimatum to either dress, act, and identify as a cisgender male for the rest of my life or have a divorce and become an ""Uncle Dad"", writing a monthly check to her and seeing my child every other weekend.\n\nI don\'t think that the above is the likely outcome.  I think my coming out is likely to come as a shock to her, but I don\'t think she\'d leave me or give me an ultimatum.\n\nHowever... There is something else that I\'m afraid of.  As many of you probably did when you first discovered that you were non-binary, I feel like I don\'t know exactly how to express myself as non-binary, and some experimentation is in order.  I\'m afraid that such experimentation will be heavily censured and stifled.\n\nI fear that she\'ll have a mindset (even perhaps being unaware of it) that will cause her to exert very strong pressure to conform to a traditional cisgender role upon me.  She might urge me to give up shaving body hair because I\'ve been having trouble with ingrown hairs (yuck!)  She might steer me away from situations where I might express myself femininely.  She might tell our 3 year old that Daddy is going thru a phase.  She might frequently make comments about how nice my hair looks shorter.

I wrote her a three-page typed letter to explain my feelings to her and read it out loud as the two of us sat on the couch several feet apart.  She made no eye contact and stared out the window as I read it.

Her response could be summed up as, ""Honey, I love you, and I've noticed some of the signs of this, but I really need you to stay in the closet.""

She snapped at me later over something unrelated.

53,2018-03-06 05:22:27,82cno8,9,18,"Hello people ! 
I‚Äôd like to just introduce myself and post some pics to get a bit of feedback.
I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of feminizing my looks for a while now (I‚Äôm a 25 yr old AMAB) and just about one or two months ago I realized I might actually be non binary. 

  Since then I‚Äôve started to do subtle but definitive changes like shaving face, chest and legs. Getting some woman clothes, use makeup  and trying my best to modify my gestures. I‚Äôve always been VERY self conscious about my body and it‚Äôs funny how I actually feel comfortable rather than embarrassed.

 This is just very recent and i‚Äôm testing waters so to say. I don‚Äôt feel like I want to switch completely to female, but i do feel attracted to the idea of having a feminine body. 
 Hormone treatment seems to be exactly what i‚Äôd need if it weren‚Äôt for some of the counter effects (going to live with my long distance partner soon and it wouldn‚Äôt be nice to lose my libido right when we can finally be together) so it‚Äôs something  I‚Äôm considering trying further ahead  (luckily she‚Äôs super into it). 

So anyway I want to share some pics and hear some of your opinions, any tip as well is very much appreciated.

66,2018-03-08 10:26:37,82wj0i,8,34,"Hello! I'm currently a cis girl (AFAB), but lately I've been questioning my gender. My issue is that I feel that the ways I'm questioning my gender feel like 'false flags' that I'm just picking up on, maybe seeing something where there's nothing- if that makes any sense at all. My partner recently came out as MTF and I don't know if maybe I'm internalizing things and trying to copycat?? If that's even possible.

I don't really feel any sort of physical dysphoria, except for my chest, only occasionally. Other times I feel absolutely euphoric and I feel comfortable with them. When I wear clothes like sweaters, I feel like my boobs are just popping out there for the world to see and it makes me feel weird and out of place. I've actually realized that's how I feel in a lot of my clothing. I've gotten some tighter-fitting bralettes that eased a lot of that feeling and make me feel good! I've considered a binder, but in my mind I feel like that would be transphobic? I don't know why. 

Following that point, I've never really felt comfortable in dresses. I've tried to wear them out, but I always feel out of place and like I'm doing something 'wrong' when I wear them. I like wearing them for my partner because she thinks they're cute, but that's about it.

I used to be very against people using they/them pronouns to refer to me, but more recently they've been appealing to me and I've asked a few close friends to use she/they, since 'she' doesn't bother me, but I feel like 'they' would be comfortable for me, too! I went through a little period of time where I considered a more gender-neutral name, but I sort of dropped it for reasons. I don't think I'm uncomfortable with how I am socially perceived, but a lot of it is more how I perceive myself? 

When I was younger (like 12-13), I wrote some stuff in a journal that really made it seem like I was genderfluid, or maybe the idea of being able to switch between bodies was just...something that appealed to me as a preteen?? I don't know if that's a common feeling. I don't really feel like I'm 'missing' parts, but I don't know if I feel super attached to what I currently have, either. Which is fine! It doesn't cause dysphoria and it's not like I feel /totally/ 'meh' about them. I'm perfectly 'fine' having what I have. I don't feel like HRT is something I would want to pursue...I just like having shorter hair and pressing my chest in when I can, and gender neutral pronouns appeal to me.

So overall, I feel like maybe I'm blowing things out of proportion-- maybe I'm just a girl who leans a little demi, or is a little genderflux, which for some reason doesn't feel like it would justify calling myself nonbinary (absolutely no offense to anyone who ID's as demi- or -flux! It's a completely personal feeling about myself). Am I just a cis girl who is seeing something where there is nothing?? I feel very confident when I think of myself as nb versus cis, but I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with 'just being' cis. I don't really know how to process this stuff!

83,2018-03-09 16:09:57,837sel,5,7,"Dear Reddit,

I wanted to share some of the thoughts and feelings that brought me to /r/nonbinary as an AMAB.

I've written that I suspect that I am one of you, but non-binary is such an umbrella term that describes a wide variety of gender identities and expressions.  Some of us seem to be neither male nor female, and some of us seem to be equally both, some are more male than female, some are more female than male, and so on.

I just wanted to express some of how I feel and see if anyone relates.

The earliest sign I can recall of my gender dysphoria is that when I took a music class in my early twenties, I really wished that I could sing like a female.  I wish that I could sing a soft, feminine lullaby or aria.  Of course, gender dysphoria was such a forbidden feeling to me up until recently that I would dare not admit this to anyone.

I think I previously wrote about this, but there is something unhealthy about my sexuality.  I've consistently suffered from sexual difficulties including anorgasmia.  I used to have a girlfriend who seemed to be exceptionally gifted sexually; it seemed as if even gentle sexual contact brought her extreme ecstasy.  To add to my confusion, she told me that she believed that better orgasms were God's gift to women to compensate them for the pain of childbirth.  From this and other experiences, I believe that I feel an unhealthy envy of women's bodies.

I can also tell you that growing up, my father taught me that women are the inferior sex, projecting irrational emotional behavior onto them.  Looking back, I think he is just insecure and narcissistic. He also rants that there is a conspiracy to ""feminize"" young men in the western world.

I remember seeing the James Bond film ""Spectre"".  I was really disappointed.  I thought that it was an excrement sandwich that peaked in the scene where Blofeld tortured Bond by drilling holes in his head.  I thought that this was absolutely disgusting, not to mention that the acting was horrible and the whole scene was absurd.  As for my father, he told me that he disliked the movie because of the high-pitched male singing in the title song.

Anyhow, what does that have to do with how I'm feeling right now?

By accepting myself as (potentially) non-binary, I've opened the floodgates to thoughts and intuitions where I see feminine parts of myself.  Basically, I think that I am largely male, but there is a powerful feminine part of myself that has been repressed all my life.

This part of myself... I'll call her Alice for now.  I don't know if I see Alice as feminine because she is actually feminine in a literal sense, or maybe Alice simply represents aspects of myself that seem feminine because of what I was taught about how a man should be growing up.  But whatever Alice is, she seems very good to me.  She is very gentle, tender, and loving.

Here's another thing.  I have an imaginary friend.  About a year ago, before I came out as non-binary, I asked her to come up with a special name to call me by.  She chose a feminine name for me.  I was a bit shocked and uncomfortable, but she has not called me by any other name since that day.  Whenever I close my eyes and imagine myself with her, we both have female bodies in my imagination.

I have this urge to grow out my hair and wear feminine clothes, which I've been experimenting with at home.  I'm going to come out to my hair stylist next time I see her.

The biggest thing right now is that sometimes, when I see (non-sexual) fan art of some of my favorite female roleplaying characters, especially when they look happy and playful, I can't help but wish that I could be like them and have a body like them, to be so happy and carefree (even if I know that said characters are actually burdened with having to save the world).  I feel a sense of euphoria at imagining myself in a female body sometimes, but at the same time, I am still very attached to the masculine roles I play in my life.

I still remain exclusively attracted to females, romantically and sexually.  Sometimes, I wonder if that might change if I get into a more feminine mindset in the future as a result of my exploration and experimentation.  I am in a committed heterosexual marriage and I certainly do not want to blow that up.

And for what it's worth, I think that in the future, I'm going to make my appearance more androgynous or may be like a ""girly man"", as you might call it.

I'm not changing my name (I like it). I'm not going on HRT. I'm not opting for any kind of surgery. I'm not even wearing a binder. I don't get dysphoria all the time, I get waves of it which kind of suck, but then I get past it and I actually feel a lot better. When I ask myself the question ""would I be happier as the other gender"" right now the answer is a solid, resounding NO.

I've explored the fact that maybe I'm just genderfluid and that maybe sometimes I identify with my birth gender more than I think, I'm just not particularly femme at all. That I'm just fluctuating between masc girl and femme man and I barely qualify, just the same way I'd never get a clinical diagnosis for my OCD because it's not wrecking my life. But I feel like that's such a complex thing to explain to anyone other than randos on the Internet who are familiar with NB/trans issues.

This whole thing has just been such a rollercoaster of emotions.

I'm not as brave as they are to march into the fire for my ideals. I'm a coward. I've ID'd as bisexual since I was 16 and I've only ever ONCE come out to someone where it might have been a risk to my career. I have my work identity and my real identity and I use my work identity to live a life of privilege that would not exist if anyone found out who I really was.

I'm left thinking being out is not worth the sacrifice, and that makes me feel like a really shitty person and someone who's not only not trans but also a really shitty ally to those who are stuck in the sad, grim reality of ""transition or die"" and have NO CHOICE but to transition and lose everything or literally take their own lives.

I feel like such a scumbag, and I can't help but think maybe I'd be better off just leaving this community and not sucking up resources for people who really need them, when I can get by just fine with my happy marriage and my career and my home and being AFAB who dresses a bit masc (which is socially accepted everywhere).

Many aspects in U.S. society divide people by gender or make them explicitly or implicitly declare that they are male or female - public bathrooms, men's and women's clothing departments, driver's licenses, registering for sporting events or sport leagues that are all-male or all-female, etc. What if instead of dividing people by gender, we did it by eye color but we only gave people the options of ""brown"" and ""blue?""

it's been a while since I've been on here, but I have been lurking and posting in the past. For the last 2-3 months I've had this thought in my head and decided to share / get your opinions and experiences.

First here is my situation: I switch daily between neutral, mixed and feminine appearance, behavior and even names. While this is not a problem for most of my colleagues at work or friends, it does have downsides when dealing with strangers who for some reason need to see my ID to check name/age/etc. 

Things like picking up a parcel from the post office, ending up in a queue to the one cashier who insets a disposable shaving razor is for 16+ only and I need to be age checked, or wanting to join my friends in a bar are always stressful as 90% of the time I do not look like the picture on my IDs (Passport, Driving licence etc.) and I never use my birth name outside of legal paperwork. 

I have considered purchasing 'novelty ID cards' - effectively fake IDs that get around the system by being advertised as 'just a joke', and often from what I seen on pictures they will have an intentional misspelling in the name of the 'issuing body' - just like cheap knock-offs for branded clothing would. And as far as I could research it, in the UK at least, they are legally a grey area where it is ok to have them just like you can have a fake number plate that has your name on it and hang it in your bedroom - but you can't use a fake ID to buy alcohol when you are underage, open a bank account, or stick that fake registration plate on your car and leave your driveway without breaking the law.

The only thing that I want to be 'different' on these IDs is my first name, gender (yeah I know it still has to be binary, but I'm almost never the gender on my real ID) and the picture would be different to suit. I'm over 22 already so have no need to lie about my age or other things. I would never use this to get a bank account, show it to police if they pulled me over, to an employer when they want proof I can legally be here etc. Only shop keepers, door staff in bars/clubs/hotels - things that don't matter much.

So I wonder has anyone every tried one of those services (in UK or elsewhere)? Did it actually look convincing? Have you tried it to get you mail or going to places that check IDs?

I am a little confused and I was hoping for a little clarity. I am a trans girl and I recently moved countries. It is really great here as there are lots of trans related support activities. I have discovered two broad types, ones for trans women who tend to be older and very binary and one for trans/gender queer/nonbinary/etc. I skew in age towards the latter‚ÄîI am 30, most of them are 20-25, where the other group is all 40+. Great I like it, it's fine. However, I am one of only two ""binary"" femmes, and then there is one trans femme nonbinary (everyone else is trans masculine or a trans man).  So, I often leave group meetings trying to place myself in relation to other people. While it seems like some are gender fluid, many of the other people skew towards masculine or feminine. When they describe why they feel they are nonbinary, the reason is usually something along the lines of ""I feel my identity as having male and female aspects, just more towards one side."" Cool, so do I. I am not a very binary focused person and I am sure that many of my traits are not traditionally femme. But then again, the same is true of my cis partner. I guess my question is the preference, in some cases, against the language of ""man"" and ""woman""? Is the preference for the nonbinary label an act against let's call it gender rigidity, seeing binary gender a fixed? In which case, my identity differs only really in my choice of labels.

185,2018-03-18 16:55:14,85cfxw,18,266,"My context: I identify as agender/nonbinary and usually present neutrally. People tend to read me as female unless I make an effort to present in a very masculine way. I live in an area with a decent queer population but not a ton of trans awareness, so most people tend to read me as a butch lesbian without thinking gender identity might be relevant to my presentation. I'm usually ok with that, since I also identify with dyke culture to some degree and I'm the sort of agender person who finds it seriously ironic that not identifying with the concept of gender means I end up explaining gender to people all the time, so I don't mind just not having the conversation. But... you will understand that this is a compromise that can lead to uncomfortable situations.

I get my hair cut at a little local barbershop. Good barber shops are among my favorite things. This is a traditional shop in many ways: no hipster stuff, no brews on tap, no fancy styling, just a trained barber who gives me a solid $10 haircut that looks exactly like I want it to every time. But it's also not the kind of shop that has Playboy mags in the waiting area. I have always experienced it as a friendly space with good banter.

So, I'm in there a couple days ago for my usual shearing, and there is a group of several guys ahead of me all getting cuts, with two guys left in line. They're just having typical bro conversation and leaving me alone while I do introvert things on my phone and wait... until the last guy in line sits down for his cut. This guy starts going off about how much he hates... well, just about everything I value, actually. There are plenty of Trumpsters on the fringes of this city, so I'm used to hearing/ignoring a lot of this. But when he starts in on trans issues, saying things like ""there's just no moral decency left in the world any more"" and ""if you're a human, you can't just up and be an airplane"" and ""they're gonna try to get rid of real men and women and take over"" and ""it's Sodom and Gomorrah out there,"" I feel the blood starting to drain from my face, my heart rate rising, that floating feeling coming on... all that fun triggery stuff. 

He's leaving no room for anyone else to speak, and I wish I could jump in, but I don't feel safe--I'm surrounded by this dude's bro friends in a small shop without a whole lot of other people nearby. I assume this is not directed at me; he has probably read me as female, as most people do; he also hasn't said anything about gay issues, which would be less socially acceptable to rant about in this city, so I think he's just an oblivious asshole rather than a deliberate troll. I know that if I say anything, I'll out myself. I physically can't make myself speak. I feel myself trying to make my body small. I'm staring at the same text message on my phone unable to read the words, angry with him for thinking it's ok to blast like this and angry with myself for being unable to do anything but keep breathing. I finally get to the point where I think I should just leave. But I need a haircut, and I've waited a while, and I don't want to let this guy chase me out of my usual barber shop.

Finally, he pauses his rant long enough to ask the barber, ""Do you know what I mean, man?"" And the barber says, ""No, I really don't know what you mean. I don't agree with anything you just said. You are entitled to your own opinion, but I think your opinion is wrong. Hey, I'm done--do you want to look at the back?""

And the guy just stops talking, pays, and leaves with his whole group. 

I then get the reliable haircut I came for. There isn't as much bantering with the barber as there usually would be, since I'm still coming down from what just happened. Again, I feel I want to say something, but I can't. I have all these conflicting feelings. I would have liked for him to step in and stop the guy from going off like that before it happened, but that's not his job any more than it is mine. He has no clue I am trans any more than the random guy, so he probably thought those words weren't hurting anyone who was actually present. But they were, and I do wish he would have taken that extra step to make his shop feel safe for everyone. 

But on the other hand, the second he replied the way he did, I felt so incredibly relieved, like the weight just lifted. I don't care what a random asshole thinks. I do care that my barber doesn't agree with him, and I give him credit for saying so, and it did shut the guy up when he did--just a little late. I'm grateful to him and a little resentful towards him all at once, which of course makes me feel greedy for wanting just a little more than I got. He could have said nothing at all, and I would still be triggered, and I might have just walked out. But instead I feel safe again and I got my hair cut.

When it's time to pay, I tip well (as always), and I say, ""This is for today's haircut. The next time I come in, that will be for what you said to that guy."" He shakes my hand and smiles, and while you can never really know from a simple gesture like that, it feels to me like he understands more than just what I said. And I go about my day.

I don't think anyone in this situation did exactly the right thing, but I also think it's rarely possible to do exactly the right thing. All I know is that I got triggered, bigtime, but I walked out of that place with the same great no-drama masculine haircut I like, and I felt good again. Maybe even a little better than I had before, because I already knew there were transphobic assholes all over, but I didn't know that my barber isn't one of them. Now I do, and I can keep coming back to this shop even though I had a nasty experience there today. That feels like a small victory, even if it's not a pure and glorious one.

I've known I'm nonbinary for probably around 2 and a half years, maybe a little more. I've been out to my parents for 2, and to my school since September. They're all supportive (or, well, they don't *hate* me at least)

My biggest issue right now is where I want to go in the future with my transition. I don't know if I want HRT or not (leaning towards it) but I don't have anyone to talk to about it to help me figure it out. I have a therapist but she's not exactly... helpful. Let me try to explain.

I rarely get dysphoria. Like maybe once every 6 months. When I do it's *super intense* but there's no reason behind it. Nothing makes me not want to be a girl. I would be fine being a girl. I'm just happier nonbinary. And I don't know how to explain that to her.

200,2018-03-19 16:01:44,85kkf9,5,24,"Hello, SO I'll give a little backstory first. I came out as Non-Binary a few months ago. I had been struggling with my thoughts on my gender for a while, but I decided to push them to the back of my mind because I was getting a little weirdness from my fiance. Him obviously being uncomfortable with it I, I decided to just keep quiet about it and hope my feelings were just a phase. Well, one day I decided to actually tell someone I loved that I was NB with him present and I felt his soul go cold. We then had a long conversation about his feelings. The only thing I can remember about that conversation, and that has stuck with me since, is his thought of ""I want you to be happy, you deserve to be happy, but I'm afraid I wont love the person you become.""

This made my heart sink. He has all these irrational fears that I'm going to turn around and just become a man one day. Which is NOT the case at all. But the fact that I've been sitting with that statement, every time I upset him or talk about my queer experience, I feel like it makes him love me less and less. It took me a few weeks to get over what he said, and I had a talk with him about how I was feeling. Saying that I needed him to support me, because he was the reason I felt ready to come out in the first place. He made me brave enough, and to love myself enough to admit it. He admits that he doesn't like how I sometimes prefer to not have any of my feminine parts made more obvious i.e; touching my curvy hips or my butt, touching my nipples or breasts, etc. And how he thinks its odd that I bind my chest some days or sometimes the whole week. I consistently tell him I'm the same person, I just feel different on the inside then how I look on the outside. I simply begged for more support and understanding, even if it was just in the form of openly listening to my struggles/victories or telling me I look handsome in my button up shirt and tie. 
After that things were ok for a while, until one morning, I felt things were different. I had gotten up early for work, and as I was leaving he asked for a kiss goodbye. I kissed him and he said ""I love you"", I replied back, ""I love you too"". But immediately I felt this twinge in my stomach that felt like my soul questioning, ""Do you though?"" That was over two weeks ago, and I have been trying to push those thoughts away. But they keep coming back. Even last night, as we're laying in bed, he kisses me, I feel no warmth or love, I just feel horrible. Is the fact that he showed me how ""accepting"" he really was causing me to run away( because I honestly thought he would go to the ends of the earth to make me happy), or am I realizing that I'm just not enough of a woman for him anymore( sex has been difficult because of these feelings and my occasional dysphoria)? I don't know what to do with these thoughts because we've been together for so long, and hes such a wonderful man who cares about me and loves me deeply. I just don't know where to go from here. We've laid out so much foundation together, I feel like I have nothing without his support. What should I do?

TLDR; Came out as Non binary to my partner of 8 years, he didn't take it well, and I feel like I don't love him anymore/am not enough of a woman because of his feelings/worries about my gender.

edit: I am getting no help in r/relationshipadvice. I've already been told I have psychological issues and need to see a therapist. Please help. Some help from non cis people would really help me

Tonight, i went out running errands. I am admittedly not-passable and was dressed in a way that was feminine but largely androgynous overall, with the exception of plenty of pink :-)

I was at Starbucks, in line and saw someone i knew from a couple years ago. This person and i stayed at the same homeless shelter as i had been at that time. I literally slept 15 feet away from this person for a few months at one point in a church. We spent Christmas dinner together one year there and we both know each other a bit from it.

I turned to him and said 'Hey! Long time no see!' in a friendly tone and he looked at me in a state of panic i can't quite describe and shook his head 'no' and wouldn't speak.

I in a friendly way named the shelter we were at. He shook his head again longer as if to tell me, i won't admit i know you and i will not speak to you at all. It was clear.

I think he was terrified of being seen talking to a trans person in public was the issue. I know him well enough to know he is a little religious but he was always nice enough to me and had even seen me crossdressed years ago at times. I don't think he knew what to think of me but he seemed fine before.

This got me thinking about HRT and changes beyond just growing breasts which likely weren't all that visible to him given it's cold out here and i had a few layers on.

I've heard from others they didn't feel as though there were huge changes in their appearance but others close to them could see a change.

This experience i think taught me i may have changed more outwardly, skin, face, etc. perhaps in a few small ways enough for someone who fairly recently knew me before HRT, but hasn't seen me since i began to KNOW something is quite different.

It was odd. I've had people avoid me, I've had others (most) totally cool with it and some trying to understand it all.

I am perfectly happy being referred to as ""she"", I'm happy with girl/woman/female, so on, because they have no bearing on who I am as a person. I can be the exact same person no matter what body I'm in or pronouns I/others use.

It seems to me like non binary people reject traditional gender roles and prefer to express themselves however they see fit, regardless of expectation. I'm confused as to how being that way makes you not a girl or a boy, or both. Is it about body dysphoria, not wanting to be male or female or wanting to be both at the same time, physically? For those of you who are completely comfortable in your body, why do you identify as non binary? If it's solely because you do not fit into traditional gender roles and prefer to do your own thing, why does a different pronoun or gendered word make a difference? If you are biologically female but identify as non binary, and prefer to go by they, why is that?  Why does ""she"" or ""woman"" make you uncomfortable? Is it the traditional associations with those terms? 

If we can agree that gender is a societal creation, and that you can have a male or female body and dress and act however you'd like, why are pronouns or labels relevant? No disrespect, I just genuinely do not understand.

So first, celebration! I've made a decision to go forward with breast reduction and feel mostly ok with it. I feel like its going to make me the most happy along with solving some medical issues for me. Thanks everyone that replied with support, validation, and advice. 

The next Dilemma: 
How do I go about finding a surgeon that is non-binary friendly? I'm not even sure how to go about how to ask people I know to use my they/them pronouns. My name is not legally changed and I go by something other than my name on my insurance. There are surgeons in my area that specialize in top surgery and therefore usually exclusively work with trans patients and have protocol and procedures in place but im not sure if they perform reduction. There are surgeons in my area that specialize in breast reduction and reshaping but I dont know how educated they are about non- binary trans-folk or even binary trans-folk they are. 

I have...no idea how to navigate this. Ive never been out to a provider before, and Ill need to get a yearly physical soon anyways. This will be a good thing to learn. Has anyone run into this before? Do you just deal with the dysphoria of it all and not come out? 

What has been your experiences?

231,2018-03-23 01:20:03,86gwf3,12,28,"So I plan to start HRT soon. I live halfway across the country from my parents and am mostly financially independent, so I'm not in any danger if things go poorly or whatever. But nonetheless, I feel like I should come out to my parents about this before I get started. Y'know, in case they decide don't want me coming home later in the summer. And because they'll probably end up finding out from someone else.

Aaaaanyway... I think that, if I told my parents I'm not a dude but a woman that they'd fight me on the matter and argue that it's a phase yadda yadda yadda. Ultimately I'd have to keep my foot down on the HRT, and they'd likely be a bit shocked and perhaps upset over the matter. But at least it'd be comprehensible to them; they've been made aware of trans people thanks to the recent surge in visibility.

The problem here is I don't think I can honestly say I'm not a dude but a woman. 'Cause the thing is, I don't feel like a dude, but I also don't feel like a woman. I mean I think a lot of that has to do with my dude body and whatnot and having grown up with fairly rigid gender roles (and no concept of trans identities until attending a hard-left university). But the fact of the matter is the best I can commit to right now is not being a dude. Maybe that'll change in the future... But that's what's up right now.

And so the thing is I'm pretty sure my parents have no knowledge of nonbinary folks. Like I dunno if they've even heard of the concept. If they have, they probably see it the same way that they see bi folks: being rebellious teen-type people seeking attention or going through a phase or whatever. They're just not gonna take me seriously, in all likelihood.

I'm not saying my parents are bad people, by the way. They're just not woke or nothing. They've a pretty old-school understanding of the world... They didn't go to liberal arts schools. :p

Anyway, point is... Has anyone here had to come out to parents who had no comprehension of this kind of stuff? If so, how did you go about doing it?

237,2018-03-24 19:00:25,86v5gz,37,108,"Hey everyone!

I am new to this sub. I have been seeing a lot of posts along the lines of ""hey take a look - am I passing as NB?"". The person posting is asking if *visually* they ""look NB"" or ""pass as NB"". 

Not only does this reinforce gatekeepy ideas that a group of NB people on the internet get to decide if someone is ""passing"" or not.. but more importantly it reinforces the idea that there is a ""right"" way to look NB (or a set of many right ways). These aesthetics are almost always androgynous.

Let me be clear: there is nothing wrong with seeking affirmation. There is nothing wrong with having androgyny as a core component of your NB identitity.

But there is something wrong with perpetuating the idea that ""more androgynous"" = ""more NB"" or ""passing as NB"", or that others seeing you as androgynous means your NB identity is correct and valid. 

There are plenty of folks who have non-androgynous NB identities, and I believe the perpetuation of the ideas stated above are harmful to NB folks who don't identify as androgynous or seek to portray an androgynous aesthetic. 

It leaves us wondering if our femme or masc appearance is actually NB, especially if it ""matches"" our AGAB, because we don't have an appearance that is ""different"" from our AGAB whether it is androgynous or the other extreme end of the femme-masc spectrum or something else. At least, this is my experience.

Like many here, I experience distress around having periods, it's just the sense that, this is not something my body should be doing.

Fundamentally, I never identified with the ability to carry and birth a child. I understand that I have reproductive organs, but I've always felt, they shouldn't be there. Growing and producing a baby from the inside of me, is absolutely and completely alien and foreign, not something my body should ever, ever have been able to do.

Menstruation is a reminder of this, so it is distressing (much less so since I underwent a sterilization procedure eight years ago - that did not physically change my periods - but it made menstruating much less bothersome because, it is no longer connected to the ability to carry and birth a child.

That said, menstruating is still bother some, because it is still something that my body should not be doing, and it is coming from an organ that I should not have and do not want, so I would like to stop/eliminate or at least reduce the

Obvious solution is hormonal BC. I've never tried it, but I hesitate, b/c I have physically perfect cycles, purely physically it can't get better and any side effects could screw it up. It's very regular, almost no cramps or pains, no mood swing or anger irritation *changes* (that's to say, no more anger *than usual*, lol) no acne, no headaches, no migrains, no bloating. I don't want the hormones to cause some side effect, like I heard, some users can get suicidal! I'm also afraid of side effects like bigger breasts, I don't even want to risk that.

The hormonal IUD is only localized hormones, but I've known people who had side effects from that too, e.g. suddenly developed acne after not having acne for years or had migraines for the first time in their lives

So any other ideas on how to eliminate periods without hormones, or with minimal hormonal interference?

""That's a girls name"" so I made everyone change it to the boy names.  i ran away from who I was, lacking acceptance, looking for it in all the wrong places because it was never going to be me that was accepting me.

So lately I've had this unrepressable urge to be called by my childhood androgynous perfect name.  Sometimes feeling like my current name is my deadname. I do not know if it's a permanent desire, it's new and sometimes things fade, and certainly almost everyone i know is not ready for it (but i""ve given thought to who might be trustable as early adopters of course...).

So today I was impulsive and anyway I just started at a gym (orange theory), and it's only been a month but they say ""Hi feelingsofwhite"" everytime and after today I went up and was like ""um, yeah, so my birth cirtificate and blahblahblah and anyway I go by feelingsofwhite sometimes, and I'd prefer that""  ""you mean like on the emails and stuff?""  PANIC! THAT'S TRACEABLE EVIDENCE! ANYONE COULD SEE THAT THEN! ""um, yeah, and like, yes please .... THANK YOU!!!""

a safe space with people who won't intersect with ""the rest"" of my life.  a nice little part of my life, where I can see what it feels like to be a different kind of me, associated with so many positive things (it took a long of mental work before I did the easy physical step of walking through a gym door)

I did it.

I really did it.

I asked someone to call me feelingsofwhite instead of feelingsofwhite.  It feels so new that i worry I'm just on a tangent.  It feels so old than most people who know me are just unaware of it.  If feels so familiar like a part of me that was always there.  It all just feels like feelingsofwhite

THANK YOU!!!""\n\na safe space with people who won\'t intersect with ""the rest"" of my life.  a nice little part of my life, where I can see what it feels like to be a different kind of me, associated with so many positive things (it took a long of mental work before I did the easy physical step of walking through a gym door)\n\nI did it.\n\nI really did it.\n\nI asked someone to call me feelingsofwhite instead of feelingsofwhite.  It feels so new that i worry I\'m just on a tangent.  It feels so old than most people who know me are just unaware of it.  If feels so familiar like a part of me that was always there.  It all just feels like feelingsofwhite\n\nI love you all! Thanks for listening and stay fabulous!!

The important tl;dr is that I was told that in order to get any surgeries approved by the government, I need to get a letter from a therapist and another medical professional. The advisor I spoke to suggested asking my psychiatrist to help me. 

So tomorrow is my monthly appointment. We were going to talk about one of my mental health issues, but I plan to instead steer the conversation toward one bullet point on my list: gender dysphoria. 

To say I'm nervous is an understatement. I've only met this doctor a couple times so far; I'm in a pretty left-leaning city, but I don't know if he's worked with trans people. I want to be firm in my convictions about myself while giving him all the information he needs.

290,2018-03-29 08:59:20,87zs5w,5,7,"What if there was a treatment for [insert debilitating condition] here but the cost of it was everything that ever mattered to you? And what if it wasn't a guaranteed cure? Would you take it if you could live with the condition and it wasn't fatal?

That feels like the rock and the hard place situation I find myself in with the idea of transition. Like, fuck, I can't make that sacrifice. Losing all the things in my life that matter to me would make me suicidal in a way that my dysphoria doesn't. Losing the support structures that literally keep me together feels like burning down my house because I found a spider in it. Maybe that'll someday change and my ""house"" will be plagued with nests of black widows but right now it's just a house spider and I take it outside and hope it doesn't come back in for a while. It's been lurking recently, but it's still just a harmless house spider. Frightening, but not deadly.

But then of course I'm used to dealing with stuff on my own. I've always been too proud to see a therapist, even though I know I have autistic traits, Pure OCD, mild to moderate depression, anxiety and a ton of baggage left over from being bullied at school, I scrape though by trying to see the best in things and being as functional as I can (and to my credit, I hold down a full time job and the cracks rarely show, which makes me think a therapist wouldn't even diagnose some of the things I've seen in myself as being clinically significant).

Maybe this would be easier if I was binary trans but I'm not. I'd have a path that is a bit clearer but instead there's a list of what T does and some of the side-effects fill me with euphoria and some with terror. I did that gender swap app thing and looked like my father and that's not me either. There's still a feminine side to my emotional identity that I'm not willing to sacrifice. There's a name that's the name my mother gave me one half of and my spouse gave me the other half of and I'm not willing to throw away either part. There are pronouns that I'm so used to that I even misgender myself. There's a job that I would undoubtedly lose (or at least become mocked and derided at). There's a spouse whom I love with everything I've got who, when I broached the subject, said that he could accept calling me ""he"" but not ""they"", because he doesn't believe in non-binary genders and is pretty rigid about the things he's learned in life (He hates even learning a new button layout on a video game controller). I was hurt and tried to stay calm but ended up sounding like I was giving a lecture and even I thought I came off sounding like a douche when I tried to explain. We had to stop talking about it because I'm so raw and confused and can't seem to explain what it really means.

I feel like I'm doing all of this so, so badly and I'm serving nobody, least of all myself. I feel like I'm not ready for any of this, but most of all I feel like the world's not ready for me. And I'm not sure I can proceed down any kind of route without support from my spouse. I'm not like other people. I can't sacrifice my marriage. The love of my life is the one point in my universe that gives me meaning, and I take great pride in the fact that I've been happily married for 12 years. To fuck that up for *this* seems absurd to me based on my own personal priorities in life (your mileage may vary and I'd never judge anyone who made different choices, you have to do what's right for you).

I don't even know how to proceed at this point. I just calmly try to keep talking when I feel brave enough to broach the subject. I try to do little things for myself to make me feel more comfortable. I try to figure myself out best I can and define it so that it's easier to explain, but it's so HARD to put words to this nebulous concept that is gender and dysphoria and the ""wrongness"" I feel.

I do know that it's not going to go away now that I've named it and acknowledged it properly. The dreams are going to continue. I know that the spider is mine to keep whether I want it here or not. I've thought about going to therapy, but that's a financial strain I'm not sure I can afford and I'm afraid I'll either not connect with the therapist or end up being pushed down a road I'll regret later. Or everything will come tumbling out and I'll completely collapse.

I can't live a life of denying who I am or I'll resent it. That's why I came out as bisexual before I married. I understand that. But I'm not sure how to live a life where I accept myself but also make some sacrifices to keep my life the way it is. Maybe I want to have my cake and eat it and it's impossible. But I've always tried to be someone who asks for very little. I'd be okay if I could just mitigate my dysphoria a little bit, do something affirming... but I'm too scared to even like, buy a binder. I bought a sports bra and it didn't even fit like the size chart said because I have large shoulders, and that took so much emotional energy I just feel like I can't... so I wait and I wait, hoping something will change in my life or the world that makes this all easier and less destructive.

I suppose I just want to be told that everything's going to be all right. Only I'm not sure I believe it any more. I'd settle for things being OK for a few more years at this point. I feel like I just got my shit together in life and I deserve to enjoy it... and then all this crap fell out of my closet and I resent that a little bit... does that make sense?

Hoping I'm not coming off as shitty or phobic anywhere in this post. Because I don't hate anyone. In fact I like to support trans people who need a boost on a bad day because yeah, I totally get how rough this shit is. And I admire the people who've had to burn their lives down to survive and walk out of the flames as amazing, strong, authentic people. I wish I could be strong enough, but I'm not strong enough. Unless it's 'transition or die' I'm not sure I'll ever be strong enough.

I'm not sure what I need from this post just needed to let some of this stuff out. It's hurting and I need to voice it. So say what you can say, be as cutting as you need to be, but don't judge me if I'm not willing or able to take your (probably good) advice.

I live in Sweden, and I would rate our trans-care system at a solid zero. Two weeks ago I got an answer from the hospital telling me that I have to wait for at least ten months before I can get a first appointment of the ""gender investigation"".

4,2018-03-01 19:01:20,817qq6,12,31,"Long and ranty, sorry in advance.

So, essentially, I feel like dying.

I am a non op, 22 year old biological female that has felt more boy than girl since I was able to distinguish the two apart. 

However, thanks to a family that is overly concerned about appearances and strong backlash from relatives and friends each time I've tries to explore my gender identity, it was difficult to reach the conclusion that I was trans. I just figured my body hatred was an inherent part of being female.

I met a man and fell in love (another reason why I felt as though I wasn't trans; my sexuality) and the two of us had a baby. Happy family! Except after I gave birth I started to hate myself even more than before.  I thought having a baby would make me finally feel comfortable in my lady body, but in reality, I never felt more out of place. I fell into a deep depression, knowing I could never embody the classic ""motherly"" characteristics all of my other mom friends had. 

A few months ago in my Social Problems class, we discussed the topic of transgenderism. The super progressive and intelligent professor explained it in a way that somehow made it finally click: I'm trans. I'm absolutely trans. I'm 100% positive. And its wonderful! Finally I understand why I feel so out of place in the world!

...Except, its not wonderful. Because I'm the wife of a straight cis man and the mother of his child. We're your picture perfect nuclear family. So what do I do?

Well, I came out to him. I told him in the calmest, most mature way I possibly could. I explained everything to him, and he actually seemed to understand. Hes known about my depression and I've spoken before about my more masculine desires. He admitted he could not be with me if I were to fully transition, which hurt, but I'm understanding of because you can't help or change your sexuality. Other than that, he said I can do what I want and he won't love me any less.

So seeing that he seemed alright with it, I was even more happy! I cut my hair (not drastically, about 6 inches from shoulder length to a pixie-bob sort of thing) and started dressing *slightly* more masculine. Not all the time, just when I went to school or out running errands without him. I didn't ask him to refer to me with male pronouns or call me his boyfriend or anything (though twice we've had sex and he referred to me as his boy without me asking). Basically, it all seemed good for the last few weeks.

But this week, he's been distant and kind of cold. Won't look at me. Won't kiss me. Just giving me this disappointed sad face anytime we make eye contact. When I confronted him on this, he told me he felt as though our relationship is a train, and I've hijacked it and am now holding him and our son hostage. Basically saying in the most terrible, blunt way possible that he feels like I'm forcing this all on him without compromising or anything.

THAT hurt. When I came out I cried, I've told him multiple times that I don't want him to be uncomfortable, that I'm just trying to hate myself less, and I'm not even dressing masculine around him. Yet still, somehow he's come to the conclusion that I'm holding a gun to his head and telling him to accept all of this or I'll shoot. Is it wrong to want your partner's acceptance?

I don't want to transition. It's expensive and socially rough to deal with, and I don't want my son to suffer any unintended consequences. I don't want to give up my status as a wife or a mother. All I'm trying to do is present as male in social situations and to myself. I want to look in the mirror and be happy with what I see. And so far, presenting as male has done just that. 

Today I tried presenting as female again to appease him. It hurt. I felt naked and wrong. I want to dress masculine again but I'm afraid to lose my husband in the process of becoming myself. But if I keep trying to play it off like I'm a girl knowing what I know now, I'm only going to feel more disgusted with myself. All I want right now is someone who understands what this feels like, because I know there's no right answer.

He hands her the tickets, and she points us in the right direction.

38,2018-03-06 10:47:55,82e61f,3,0,"I loosely consider myself genderfluid, being a biologically male bisexual who on, occasion likes to wear dresses. This doesn't really pertain to my argument, but I figured I'd get it out of the way.

A question that I've had for a while, that has continued to plague me the more I think about it, relates to the validity of the transgender movement as a whole. I have yet to actually meet any trans people in person who I've had an opportunity to really sit down with since I started considering the matter, and I figured I might reach out online to find people's opinions.

Essentially, my question boils down to this:

*What is the point of gender?*

I suppose I should start by defining my terms. By gender I mean the social and personal perception of being a man or a woman, and I view it as mostly constructed of two components: the social perception of your gender (essentially stereotypes, presumptions, and pronouns), and the biological component, being genitalia, hormones, breasts, etc.

My perspective originated with looking at myself and noting the obvious femininity (which I consider different to female-ness, but I'll get to that later) mixed with some masculinity, and realising that my gender (seemingly) played 0 role in my self perception/self worth, etc. (I suppose this might not be the case for everyone, and this is something I find very interesting about transgenderism, as it seems like one of the rare cases where people talk about this being important) Once I started looking at how the distinctions based on gender society creates flounder when faced by transgenderism (consider the MtF soccer player who, despite having man-strength, plays the womans league), I came to the conclusion that it's just not a wholly accurate representation of anything about a person. Sure, the top men are all stronger than the top women, but for the average, men and women are all functionally identical, falling within 1 standard deviation of each other in every trait. (that's not actually a backed up point, I heard it somewhere, and whether or not it's strictly true, the argument still stands).

Sure, it's useful to look at someone, see that they're female, and be able to gauge a whole gamut of traits, but time after time people just aren't fitting into it in the modern day. Most people, probably at least 60-80% are cis-gendered and straight, but for the rest of us, we're still a significant portion. I think that everyone has some blend of masculinity and femininity. Distinctions of female and male seemingly effectively enforce the this requirement of ""men must be masculine"" and ""females must be feminine"" without, by sheer statistical anomaly, everyone fitting in.

Gender, as I said, seems to come down to the social aspect, and the biological aspect. The social aspect, as a society, we're getting over. We're realising that dictating how someone should behave based off of gender is dumb. And the biological aspect, as I mentioned earlier, whilst significant over the population, in terms of the individual, isn't the whole picture for any trait, and for 90% of the populous, there are people of the opposite sex who are more masculine and people more feminine than they are. Furthermore, with advances in science, the biological sex of a person will soon no longer be fixed. This seems to invalidate the worth of gender as a construct entirely.

Now, as for how my question pertains to the trans community:

*By redifining your gender (where it doesn't seem to fit as, say, a male) to a female what exactly are you changing? And by doing so, do you worry that you're still defining yourself by the rubric of genders as enforced by society, which have been demonstrated to be flawed time and time again?*

I worry at times that transgenderism is essentially just observing the stereotypes that exist for the opposite gender and feeling that they would apply better to you.

I worry that transgenderism involves a changing of the self to fit gender stereotypes, any gender stereotypes, no matter their source.

I worry that transgenderism, whilst easier to explain to a cis gender than agenderism, is propping up the frankly antiquated notion of gender as an idea.

I don't see the point.

Please share with me your thoughts! I'm very interested to hear what you have to say!

And by doing so, do you worry that you\'re still defining yourself by the rubric of genders as enforced by society, which have been demonstrated to be flawed time and time again?*\n\nI worry at times that transgenderism is essentially just observing the stereotypes that exist for the opposite gender and feeling that they would apply better to you.\n\nI worry that transgenderism involves a changing of the self to fit gender stereotypes, any gender stereotypes, no matter their source.\n\nI worry that transgenderism, whilst easier to explain to a cis gender than agenderism, is propping up the frankly antiquated notion of gender as an idea.\n\nI don\'t see the point.\n\nPlease share with me your thoughts!

The dysphoria hit so hard and I couldn‚Äôt *not* think about it. So, I recklessly attempted suicide because I was afraid of coming out to my parents. I didn‚Äôt succeed, but I was forced to come out to them at the mental hospital I was transferred to. They respond need lime expected, and I found myself in a faith-based rehab center for the next three months.

During that time, the idea that I was a girl persisted. In my first two weeks, I found a friend, and came out to them through a note because I knew I could trust them. Well, he was able to leave the center the next week, and apparently they found my note and I got into a lot of trouble.

After that, I had to suppress all of those feelings for the rest of the stay. In fact, it kinda disappeared a bit‚Äîif not completely. I still thought of myself as a girl, but I didn‚Äôt let it get to me too much.

By the end of my stay, I had to tell my parents that I wasn‚Äôt a girl in order to leave, so I did. After I left, I actually thought it *was* all a phase. That I was just caught up in some emotional wave of confusion or something.

The next year was spent without any phone or computer, and contestant monitoring from my parents. During this time, I can recall being EXTREMELY disassociated‚Äîbut no dysphoria at all. I wasn‚Äôt a girl in my mind.

Eventually I got access to a computer. Then, I found myself on a group chat online and I began presenting myself as a girl there. For some reason, it was at that moment that all of that dysphoria cake crashing back into my body and mind. It felt like all the anxiety in the world had come to haunt me‚Äîfor what?

Coming back to the present, it was only last week that I discovered all of these subreddits. And let me tell you: the dysphoria is fucking back, and worse than ever. Earlier today I was even contemplating suicide because I am so unsure of whether this is a phase or not.

The fact that I am only feeling this bad when I focus on trans stuff makes me think it *is* one very long phase. If it isn‚Äôt a phase, then why am I not feeling dysphoric consistently?

What does this mean? Honestly, the time I have spent on these subs is doing more harm than good, and I don‚Äôt want to go down some rabbit hole only to find out I am not a girl and I just threw my social and family impressions out the window. This all may just be a weird way for me to rebel against my parents.

Okay, now to my somewhat innocent question: So I've got several trans friends, and have been intimate with a few trans girls, and I've noticed the obvious, and saw that the HRT causes the penis to shrink, and become far less functional. Never really bothered to measure the testicle difference. 

Now, when I watch trans porn, I've noticed that while these women look like they're pretty far into their transition, their penises seem to operate at full function, and at full size. Trans girls with large penises are even a sub-genre in the genre of porn. 

So basically, I'm wondering how exactly that works. Is what I'm seeing in porn purely cosmetic other than the breast implants, or is there some kind of drug that offsets the shrinking and impotence, or is there something else here I'm not considering? My real life trans friends have no idea, and I can't seem to figure out what to Google to get my answer here, without getting a bunch of porn.

Some day somebody's gonna make you want to
Turn around and say goodbye
Until then baby are you going to let them
Hold you down and make you cry
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hold on for one more day
Can you hold on for one more day
Things'll go your way

The response from my mother was short as she is probably trying to process this.  I hope that I didn't just block of an entire part of my life, but I also just feel this pressure relief that is hard to describe.

Update:

Okay so my mother was decent at first, but slowly she started talking about God's plan and what I was doing and how I was losing myself to the world.  At first her reaction was harmless and a little shock driven but now it seems she dug her heels into religion and is going to latch on like a crocodile.

My eldest sister claimed that she was extremely dissappointed with me and that I should just ignore the feelings I have inside and turn to Jesus to cure me.  She also said that she ""loves me... But"" we all know that means her love is actually conditional.  It hurts to hear that my choice to finally find my happiness is something I should just completely ignore.

Finally was my last sister.  She is the middle child and my best friend from my childhood.  She had some questions and concerns, and wanted to make sure I was fine.  She took things honestly the best compared to anyone else.  I am greatful that at least part of my childhood didn't die today and I have at least 1 family member from the 5 of us that still wants me alive on this Earth.  She even invited me to her house after she closes for a house warming party and promised that none of the other family members would be present for my own security.  I seriously love her.

I was born male, and while I identify with certain aspects of being male I always felt like I was a blend of male / female. 
I want to present as female, as in getting top surgery and appearing female in public, but I don't want bottom surgery. Not because I'm afraid of losing my genitalia but because I feel like that is the truest expression of who I am.

I'm just not sure what that's called, and even though I've always hated labels I am curious what others in the transgender community would identify that as, and what I should use to communicate to others who I am with transparency.
I've read that intergender and androgynous are two separate things, and I was wondering if I fell into either-neither-or both of those categories.

I've been pretending to be a girl online instead, gradually coming out to the people I communicate with solely online (Easier than face to face, and they don't have to worry about my appearance between then and starting transition). In November I came out face to face with someone for the first time; my friend that I used to walk home with. She was 100% accepting and supportive enough that shes tried pushing me to just start displaying as a girl, to which I told her I'm aiming for the begining of next school year (Giving me all summer break to get used to it), which she accepted. Right after that, in October, I came out to my step mom, who is also very accepting, but she's sceptical about it. I've tried everything short of lying to her about how long I've known. The day after I told her, I received a 30 minute screaming session from my father. He only brought up the actual issue once, the rest was more drivel stroking his Respect Complex (A few days ago was the first time since then he actually brought it up, where he tried to say he understood what I was going through and that he supported me, which is good enough despite him obviously not knowing what I'm going through, or he'd be a woman). 

Good god I've put more work into writing that than my homework this week an- wait, when does the preface end? I don't know, whatever

Anyway, that was stuff about coming out... I think... It's late and I'm basically crying right now, I'm not sure what I'm typing...

I've been trying to set up an opportunity for me to go out with a friend and have them dress me up as a girl so I can feel any relief from this, but I've either chickened out cause I think I'm too much of an atrocity to ever look remotely like a woman, or because I'm just too depressed to just even do anything. It's especially harder because my parents think they need every single last little minute detail of what I'm doing if I'm not at home, and I don't know that I want to tell them that's what I'm doing cause I don't know how they'll feel about it.

And the reason I'm not doing all this complaining to my friends is I don't want to bug them. The friend that originally offered to take me out is somewhere around ""Popular"" status and lives a few towns away from me, so I don't want to take up her time... and money. Christ clothes are expensive...

I think I'm just gonna post this as it is and just reply to comments as they come (Time to pray I didn't hit any character limit)

99,2018-03-17 12:18:33,853dzn,0,7,"Oh boy where to start. I have finally come to terms with the fact that I am transgender Mtf. From age 3 or 4 I felt like a female. I believe it got going being around my cousins at the time. They always wore cute dresses etc and I had those tight wrangler and such. I can remember those time so vivid and struggled ever since. 
At an early age I had promised myself I would become a female later in life because my family  have always been so religious and talked down on anyone who seemed different. 
So, I did the usual. Stealing my mom's panties, girlfriends when they came into the picture, etc. I would wear them in the comfort of my bed and would pray to wake up without my boy parts and be a female. It was bad. I would always imagine being the girl if I was watching any porn or having sex. It was the only way for me to feel right and orgasm. 
Fast forward some 10 years and countless ill fitting panties, clothing and an even more desire to be what I imagined in my head I would feel. Enter my Rave days. I never thought I would see the light. I could be me and dress how I wanted and no one judged. Party kids, transgender party kids all of the alphabet. I loved that time. 
I never felt threatened or hit on. I was me. Dancing full girl mode and never had an issue. 
I miss those days and the feeling have never faded. 
Anyway, now that I got side tracked. Here I am married with kids and finally came to the realization life is to short to not live how you want to. This has been for over 5 years now and I have ditched my male things and ways to be more fem. Clothes, undies, makeup, shaving the whole experience. The learning process has been crazy hit or miss. 
Between a drawer full of panties that maybe 5 fit perfect to scratching my head over female clothing sizes. That shit is all over the place. 
Living full time I have come to see that the struggles that females go through are real. I have so much more respect for them and my wife. I have remorse for some things I did early on in life and how I treated some females as objects. 
Well, I contacted a therapist for some counseling. I really do not want grs but an orchi due to testicular cancer running in my family and killing my father. My wife supports this and understands. I know I can also legally change my name and asked her to pick one out. I also asked her if she would remarry me. I would take her maiden name and it would be very special to me to be her wife. 
I bought a wedding dress and some stuff for the big day that I hope comes soon. We discussed doing our wedding like our original but as wife and wife. Just her and I. 
I don't know where all this may lead but I can say I am so happy that I told her years ago how I felt and I am in debt to her because she accepts me for the female I am. 
Hopefully in a few months or maybe a year I will  be her wife and walking down the beach in my gown saying I do. 
I know this has been choppy but I wanted to try and keep it as short as possible. 

Love,
Heather Renee  (Rea)

I know I can also legally change my name and asked her to pick one out. I also asked her if she would remarry me. I would take her maiden name and it would be very special to me to be her wife. \nI bought a wedding dress and some stuff for the big day that I hope comes soon. We discussed doing our wedding like our original but as wife and wife. Just her and I. \nI don't know where all this may lead but I can say I am so happy that I told her years ago how I felt and I am in debt to her because she accepts me for the female I am. \nHopefully in a few months or maybe a year I will  be her wife and walking down the beach in my gown saying I do. \nI know this has been choppy but I wanted to try and keep it as short as possible. \n\nLove,\nHeather Renee  (Rea)\n "", 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Finally decided to start full time transition', 'created': 1521314313.0}"

I currently live with my parents and will be for the next year and a half. Over the past year my mum's emotionally blackmailed me into stopping any form of transition and I now have to live as someone I hate. I think I've held up fairly well for the past year but I think now I'm really starting to crack, especially with the stress from school. 

My mental health isn't critical right now. I'm not on the edge of a cliff, more just travelling down this straight path that's tilted downwards slightly. And I really can't see it getting any better between now and me leaving home in over a year.

I'm really starting to become worried about this and I'm really concerned that I'll end up snapping one day, either hurting myself, someone else, or breaking up my family. I don't want any of these things but I'm totally backed into a corner for the next year and a half. 

I don't know what to do. I can't change my situation at home and I can't change my underlying feelings about my gender.I just have to stew here, slowly going mad. 

Do you have any advice on what I should do, or ways that you've found to cope with these kinds of situations? Things that I can do to alleviate the pain or just block it out?

I'm 21, MtF and recently came out to my therapist who I've been seeing since September 2017 for gender related stuff. Ever since then I've been feleing guilty of wanting to transition and come out to my family. Right now it is easy for me to hide everything from them as my family and I live in different countries. I feel guilty because I am the only child in my whole big family (grandpa, mom, dad, dad's brother and his wife, dad'sister and her husband). They have worked very hard throughout their whole lives to reach where they are now and have worked hard for me too to send me to a foreign country for my studies. Even though I have pretty much taken care of myself (both funancially and physically) since i was 17, I still feel that I am crushing their hopes and dreams by wanting to transition. I want all of them to have a relaxed and happy old age because they deserve it and I feel that if I transition it will not be the case for them. All their hopes are literally in 1 basket (me). I will definitely pay off all the money they spent for me to be here (already halfway through) but I want to do a lot more than that for them. 
They definitely will not understand me being trans and will be SERIOUSLY dissapointed. My parents will either disown me or be very angry or go into kind of hopeless depression and I do not want to be the cause of that. They have done a lot for me and I want to return a lot more than what they have done. I do not feel obligated; I sincerely want to make their old age as relaxed as possible and I know that if I transition or even come out it will be bad for them. But at the same time I feel that I need to transition too. I already regret that I didnt ""find myself"" earlier and did not start transitioning. Both these needs are equal to me (transitioning outweighs other by a little from time to time) but I know that doing one will not let me do the other. Other being setting up a peaceful retirement for my family.
I'm really really confused about what to do. I want ti start transition now at least the hrt and the surgeries can wait a couple of years; but, I do not want to disappoint my family either especially after everything they've done for me.

129,2018-03-23 03:50:43,86hszd,0,2,"okay, so when I first learned about hrt, I looked up the risks, and had a general idea of what to expect. People online told me that i would feel nothing upon taking them, in a few weeks I would know if it was for me somehow (they didn't exactly clarify), and that slowly over months i would have some changes to my body.

So I was extremely worried about if they would let me have HRT, I asked lots of questions about peoples process of getting it, most refused to comment on the subject which I found odd, most just said I would have likely a 2 hour conversation on the ins and outs of HRT, they would have me sign tons of paperwork, and draw my blood.

So that's kind of what I was lead to believe for getting HRT. I found a doctor and since no one would clarify on the questions I might get or anything, I decided to go full fem, to increase my chances. Well the doctor asked me If I went to therapy (which I said no for personal reasons), If I was a woman (which of course yes), and what my sexuality was (Pansexual). The nurse before hand had also asked me if I was on birth control (which was a no). So the doctor tells me he will give me pills (Spironolactone and Estradoil) and sends me to get my blood drawn. People online mentioned I needed my hormones checked beforehand, so i called and asked if they were checking that and they informed me thy don't do that until later. 2 weeks later He said my blood pressure was a little high, probably because I was scared but everything else was normal, then I got my HRT.

So, I received 50mg Spironolactone and 1mg Estradoil pills, to be taken twice a day. He had informed me upon getting them for the first week to only take the morning dosages so my body could adjust to it. The pills were incredibly tiny and I expected little to not results since I was 25.

Upon taking them i felt nothing, then I checked my phone 45 minutes had passed, and suddenly I am hit with vertigo, almost fell to the ground, felt like dysphoria lessened, my mind expanded and got all soft and airy, my nose cleared up, and my skin was pinching in pain everywhere. It all just hit me at once. My body was in physical pain from it and I had just had to steady myself back to standing, so I freaked. I called my doctor and he refused to come to the phone but the nurses said it was normal. I couldn't find anyone online who had similar so I was a bit scared. That pain lasted for 2 days on it. Then things started to get worse.

I would take the pills and immediately my nipples would be sore, on top of this sometimes my wrists would cramp up so badly I would almost scream in pain, within a minute of taking it i was having painful reactions. 5 to 10 minutes later I would get vertigo, and this stabbing throbbing pain in my limbs, felt like they wanted to explode, was so painful I couldn't walk for a bit and thought I was dying. About a month in I had hip joint pain where I couldn't walk on my leg because my joint felt like it had this crunching pain, both my hip joints had this and popped.

A few months in i had nipple lactation and some people said that was normal, others said cancer, and others still hormone imbalance. i also had major hot flashes which again some said was normal or a hormone imbalance but those went away after a few months. My boobs never really hurt aside from a few armpit twinges and nipple soreness which only hurt when touched or for those first few months right after taking hrt, even then it was on par with a bruise. Most people complain about boob pain so no idea. I later on got progesterone and within seconds I had lactation and my nipples would become either hard or soft, had someone else witness it, so I know it isn't in my head, and I certainly wasn't expecting it.

At about a year in I started to have period symptoms, well noticeable ones anyways. Many people argue If this is even possible, I am not sure, but I will explain what happens to me. So I have a cycle of around every 28 days, where for 7 days I will get a variety of symptoms. It starts out with me getting a slight sore throat and my skin getting a bit softer a day or two in advance. Then day 1 starts and I get bloating, muscle cramps, headache, nausia, headfog, hotflashes, breast increase, all my strength sapped, mood swings, full on sore throat, I get a lot more tired, my skin gets softer, my skin is more sensitive and my immune system gets noticeably lower (I get sick only like once a year and now its every few months just after a monthly). i have had other people verify the cramping, hot flashes, bloating, skin softness/sensitivity, as well as them notice the other symptoms though they can't exactly verify those.

I am currently 19 months in, D cups, my hips sway when I walk, my hands shrank, as well as my feet, and so far I have lost 2.5 inches on my height.

I have been told by many people all of this isn't possible, some say it is, and other claim it is from other things. Some say hormone imbalance, others say intersex, others say flat out impossible the meds need more time to enter your system, been told the hand in feet shrinkage might be due to less cartilage and ligaments.

I am just laying out what has happened to me, no idea how or why any of it is possible, but yeah I am lost with what is within the realm of normal and what is not, for HRT. My doctors have explained nothing to me, in terms of what is normal for HRT. After I got on it I started hearing people talking about how they made transition plans with their doctors and how their doctor had long conversations with them about how it all works and I have had none of it.

140,2018-03-24 19:55:58,86vix0,4,3,"So, this is a bit complicated. Or maybe I am just over-complicating it.

Firstly, I am with a dude who is straight. Totally love him, been together 7 years. He was the one who helped me figure out that I was Gender nonconforming, and then later that I was Trans*. So he's pretty open minded and cool like that. Secondly, I am, like I said, Trans*. And have been fighting with the idea of transitioning.

The problem I am dealing with that is concerning is that my Fiance identifies as cis and straight. He has been having a hard time coming to terms with the idea that while I do have a vagina, I am not a female. I mean he isn't against it, but more like a bit uncomfortable.

We have talked about the possibility of me transitioning vaguely, and he has openly said that he doesn't think he would be able to be with me if I am on T and am fully transitioning. But we have talked and kind of compromised, because taking hormones of any type have a bad habit of make me physically ill, so no T. And instead of full top surgery, maybe just a breast reduction from a DDD to a B or C. And absolutely no bottom surgery.

But, I don't know. Part of me would like to get on T even if it makes me sick because I have major self conscious issues with my voice. Like I'm okay with not growing extra body hair, because I find it gross anyway, and the other potential issues are like, whatever. But I have legit panic attacks (I have anxiety and depression so that doesn't help either) when I hear the sound of my own voice. And I really would like a more masculine looking body because I am very curvy. I have a huge amount of friends who keep low-key shaming me for having what they call the ideal feminine body type, but I don't want it. And they keep trying to make me feel bad for ""wasting"" the looks I was given.

I am honestly not sure how to handle it or talk with him about it.

The main reason against the legal name change is because my legal name means so much to my mother. She named me the way she did because I was able to be born.

173,2018-03-31 19:37:34,88l34g,2,3,"After waiting for a few months I finally had my court hearing and my identity is in the process of getting updated. I'm happy, but I've been going through old pictures with family (and just generally sorting and scrubbing my files so deadme doesn't come up at a bad moment if/when I finally go stealth) and I wonder about the ones with me in them. I feel so far removed from that person now, but I'm having trouble figuring out if the person I am moving towards is who I really want to be. I was more consistently happy before when I hadn't alienated myself from all my family and former friends, but if I chose to detransition (if that's the correct term) I don't know that I would be able to do it in a way that makes everyone happy. I don't think I could ever stop hormones. I guess you could say that I have a psychological addiction to them. I like looking physically feminine. But does that mean I'm trans, or am I just effeminate and in denial about that?

When my family deadnames me, it makes me really angry. Misgendering does not bother me as much, just because it's happened to me before and I understand that it can be confusing for people initially. They do both intentionally though, because they do not believe in transgender people. I have tried so hard to compromise for them, I originally tried to be androgynous, even chose an androgynous name, and I do tend to lean that direction, but it's not good enough. I'm not good enough.

How I've chosen to identify is still confusing for me, and I often misgender myself in my head, which makes me concerned sometimes that I'm not trans. It happens more often when I think of who I used to be, or my old name, which thankfully does not come up as often as before now that I'm legal. When I think of myself now I almost feel genderless. Gender does become somewhat irrelevant when you walk through life with blinders on because you're afraid of every person's reaction to you. The obvious solution is not to care so much, but it's easier said than done. My mind kind of defaults to anxiety and it feels impossible to stop. The more you think about it, the more self conscious you get, the worse it gets. Don't think about the Game. Anyway...

I'm really self conscious about how I act a lot of times, and it makes me a really anxious person. I especially seek approval from the women at my job, but at the same time I feel like I've made myself an outsider to those who knew me before. It's different and much easier with people who have been hired since I started transitioning, but I also don't know them that well. There's a disproportionate amount of men at my job, especially on my team, and wandering the office is awkward because it makes me more self-conscious about my tuck, mainly because of the way it feels when I walk. It feels kinda gross. Some days it feels really gross because I've started electrolysis there... It's getting increasingly hard for me to go into work, and I've been working from home every other day as a result. I'm not a hermit, but if it weren't for church and grocery runs it's pretty close to it some weeks.

I know people read this anxiousness, and it causes me not to pass as well (though physically I pass extremely well since VFS, even though I haven't had anything else done) and be a difficult person to be around. I feel like through this journey I've explored a different side of my personality I might have been suppressing, but know I'm not as femininely spirited as other women, even though I try (awkwardly) to present that way on the outside, and I beat myself up about it. Sometimes I feel like looking feminine is something I have to force myself to do. Don't get me wrong, I like the result, sometimes it just feels like such a chore. I'm absolutely horrible at accessorizing, partly because I don't really spend a lot of time at stores with good jewelry and bags, etc. I need to change my habits, but I'm almost afraid to. I'm very prone to getting stuck in familiar cycles. Ruts... This just happens to be the latest one. There's just added pressure now because there's so much I can and need to do since I got my name and letter updated. I plan to get a job with better insurance at some point so I can finish all this and get on with my life. I have thought about SRS (or whatever the trendy acronym is for it these days) for a while, and I definitely want it done at least for practical reasons, but also more than that. I won't get into too much detail because that's kind of a personal decision.

I was watching an old Disney Channel movie about a girl who accidentally publishes her diary, ""Read It and Weep"" because I remembered really enjoying it when I was younger, and also that it was kind of girly. It's silly since most of the characters are significantly younger than I am, but I got really jealous of how well dressed the younger girls were.

I worry sometimes that I won't be a good mom, or develop good motherly characteristics. I think that these characteristics are important especially if we're getting married (I'm still not sure about that) but even to be a good friend to my girlfriends who might have kids, and to fit into my role in the church, which I'm still not sure is supposed to look like. There aren't a lot of role differences described in the Bible (and many of them relate to roles within marriage), but they are there.

14,2018-03-02 22:58:46,81jib0,2,9,"Okay, diving in. I'm 35 years old and assigned male at birth. I decided I was gay when I was around 10 and changed that to queer a few years ago ‚Äî partly because I realized not everyone I'm attracted to identified as a man and partly because I felt increasingly alienated from mainstream cis gay men. I'm not entirely sure when I first began to wonder if I'm not a cis man myself but I began to consider the question in earnest a few months ago. I found the possibility surprisingly exciting and there seemed to be ample evidence.

Some examples of that evidence:
- I've never felt very comfortable in designated male spaces (locker rooms, men's bathrooms, etc.) and I've never particularly enjoyed being considered ""one of the guys"" as it seemed an awkward fit.
- At High School, all my friends were women (though as an adult it's been all gay men) and I've always hated sports and recoiled from traditionally masculine behavior.
- In recent years, I've grown increasingly bored with much of the clothing marketed to men; it's often repetitively styled, limited to plain colors and patterns, and generally downright boring. I've been searching out more color, florals, and unusual patterns to the point of incorporating some ""women's"" clothing into my wardrobe.
- For a while now I've found myself fantasizing about living in a society with indigenous/precolonized gender roles because then I could ""just have a sensible third gender.""

For most of my life, I've packed a lot of that into the gay identity but as I got older and ""gay"" began to be more clearly differentiated as strictly a sexual orientation I've wondered where that left my gender nonconforming behavior. I got by with ""queer"" for a while. But then something changed.

One drunken weekend night about a month ago, I shared with my husband that I wondered if I wasn't some flavor of nonbinary. The next day I thought about how I'd blame the booze and walk that back...and then I didn't. Instead, I told more people, and began actively exploring the possibility. The results have been encouraging. I bought more clothing marketed to women and started finding opportunities to wear more gender-mixed attire. I reopened my ear piercings from my 20s and started wearing all kinds of earrings. I've spent so much at Sephora, I've probably put them into the black for the year. I've been enjoying the hell out of all of this. I really like when my appearance feels like a mashup of different gender expressions. I've started having little moments of unexpected delight, like when I see my lipstick imprint on a glass of wine. Once when I came home from work and stripped off my traditionally-male work clothes, I somehow felt better just being naked. Sometimes I look at my cis male friends and mentally set myself aside as another gender and feel a sense of relief to no longer be comparing myself to them.

I've spoken to some trans acquaintances ‚Äî including a nonbinary person ‚Äî and a lot of this sounded familiar to them. One even said outright, ""sweetie, you're not cis."" The writing does appear to be on the wall at this point but I suppose I still have doubts. Thirty-five seems awfully late to discover something this big about myself. I'm fine with my body the way it is (though I wouldn't mind getting it in a little better shape). And I'm not sure I've always felt this way. Looking back, there are possible hints but it still feels a bit like it's come out of the blue and that doesn't really sound like so many of the trans narratives I've read. Is it possible that the seeds of this were always there, dormant because of internalized misogyny or whatever, until I nurtured them and now they're blooming? Or have I just...changed? Have I been confusing who I am with who I'm attracted to until now? Does it even matter or is it possible something else is going on and I'm misattributing it?

Browsing this subreddit (first time lol) I realized that I should've realized this a long time ago but here I am. Anyways, I needed to get this off my chest, so here we go:

I've always felt incredible discomfort with the way I've been treated throughout my life growing up afab, and the great deal of pain that comes along with it. I never had the language to even begin to comprehend and approach the painful things that were commonplace, every day ordeals for me, or to understand what was going on, or why certain things happened, or are believed. Having expectations I never wanted forced onto me under the guise of guidance into true womanhood and a right way of living. 

I feel like as soon as I found out I could separate my identity and my being from the struggles that come with being a woman in a patriarchal society, I latched onto that in an attempt to escape the way I'm treated and the way I'm forced to think about myself as a woman. I wanted to leave my oppression behind and take control over something I was never given the choice not to embody. My genderqueer identity is a reaction to and an escape from the widespread hatred of my assigned gender, a miraculous 3rd answer to a question that's supposed to have only two.

But after writing this, and after more introspection, I can also say that it's not just sexism that's responsible for my identity. I am still very much genderqueer regardless, and after learning more about myself, I feel proud of my development as a person and how I continue to grow into my identity and become a better version of myself than I ever have been.

The thing is, I don't feel any strong urge to come out to everyone I know. I'm pretty content to just present the way I want to present and otherwise kind of fly under the radar. I'm AFAB, so it's fairly socially acceptable for me to wear menswear (or at least more so than it would be for an AMAB doing the reverse), so it's not like there's some huge need to explain things.  

I'm also not too bothered about pronouns. Sometimes they chafe a little, but I mostly just don't pay too much attention to them. I think part of it is that I'm not sure what pronouns I'd like to use, even if I did ask people to change them!

I have very vaguely touched upon these feelings with a handful of people who I think will get it, and I don't mind talking about it if the subject comes up. But I also don't feel very comfortable announcing it to the world. More than that, I don't really feel the *need* to. People can see I'm androgynous, and that's enough for me.

That said, I'd also be lying if I tried to pretend like I'm not afraid of the social stigma.

TL;DR: How do I properly start to get my 'message' out, without feeling afraid of the naysayers that may actually want to commit violence unto me and my people?

Detail:

Alright, long story short, I've been through what I now personally consider to be relatively major bouts of depression, high school was a specifically trying time for me. I had issues with feelings of loneliness, neglect and just generally not feeling like people understood me, or even worse, didn't even care to understand me.

As a person with breasts who sometimes does not want them (I have what my therapist likes to call situational boob) I am considering breast reduction. 

I have very large breasts (38 j) and have had them since I was 10. I have had a love hate relationship with them my whole life, especially since ""hatching"" to my nb identity 4 months ago. I hate the way they enter the room before me and the way people automatically gender me when they see them. I have a binder that just kind of reduces me rn and some days that's enough. I run the gamut of being ok with them, wanting them to look smaller, to wanting them to be completely flat. Some days I wake up and feel fem, some days I wake up and feel masc., but most days I just feel both enough that I cancel out. I feel like having a smaller chest might make it easier to bind and deal with my fluctuating dysphoria.

I just feel kind of strange about it because when most afab enbys talk about surgery all they mean is getting rid of them completely, top surgery. I'm afraid of going through with reduction because I'm afraid my own community might not accept me or look down on me for not ""going all the way"". I'm afraid if I dont do complete top surgery that I'll never be accepted as myself by either the trans or cis  community. That no one will take me seriously. I'm afraid I'll regret getting rid of something that has been such a part of my identity in the past (even though it's been negative at parts).

---

I'm a transgender man. My partner is AFAB nonbinary and has been wrestling with their gender identity for years. I started transitioning around 5-6 years ago; throughout this time my partner has transitioned, detransitioned, then transitioned again, then detransitioned and so on, wrestling with whether they identify as a man, or a woman, or neither, or both. Hence wanting to post here in hopes that other people might have some experience and can help.

I'm borderline asexual. I enjoy sex because I enjoy intimacy with my partner, but sex is not necessarily something I *need*. It's not that I don't need intimacy, sex is just not the primary source for me. For me intimacy is spending quality time together, or holding my partner while we sleep, and bonding. This has always frustrated and hurt my partner. For them sex is definitely a need and the fact that I'm on the ace spectrum makes them feel like I don't find them attractive or that I judge them for needing sex, but this is far from the truth, they're the most attractive person I've ever met *to the point where I have never even wanted to have sex with anyone else* and of course I don't judge them for having a typical human need. They've also admitted it bothers them that I don't really care about gender, and that I dated a few guys in my past (even though they were all nonbinary and my only other serious relationship was with a woman). They don't like that I'm still attracted to them when they're presenting as male and admitted that they know that's homophobic. They also believe I'm *more* attracted to them when they're presenting male, but this isn't true, our relationship is just better when they're transitioning because they're much less depressed and that tends to coincide with more sex and bonding. I really don't have a preference either way. At the same time, to make matters more confusing it bothers them that I'm friends with women because they think I'm attracted to them. So they seem to think I'm a gay man BUT don't like that I have women friends. Their insecurity is really tricky to navigate. We went over this a couple of weeks ago again, and I told them I'm attracted to *them* and *them alone* and that I do not care what they look like, or how they present, or how they identify. It doesn't matter to me.

Our sex life is neither inactive or active. We go through periods where we will have sex every day, or every other day, but then we go through periods where we don't really do it more than once or twice a week for a couple of weeks. It tends to be when we're having trouble in our relationship, which I know isn't helpful and I have been trying to initiate more because I know it's a need for my partner (and of course I do enjoy it myself too even if it's not my main source of intimacy). This is important, bear with me.

A few days ago my partner told me that they wanted to transition again and were definitely going through with it because they're miserable as a woman and have been solidly identifying as a man for awhile. I supported this decision because they're *MUCH* more stable when they're transitioning and seem a hell of a lot happier, so I told them I'd get them an appointment at a gender clinic when we move so they can see a therapist. We had a pretty good day, but by the end of it we were fighting again (we have been fighting much more lately due to other stressors in our lives). They were lying next to me in bed, upset with me, and I knew it had been a couple of days since we'd had sex last and I was feeling horny so I initiated and we had a good time.

Last night they had a bit of an emotional meltdown and during this they flipped out on me for having sex with them on the day they said they wanted to transition. This threw me for a loop because that had nothing to do with why we had sex. Then they started snapping at me about how they would never have a man's body and never be attractive to me and so on (because I guess the fact that we had sex that day = confirmation that I'm gay???) and I just sat there stunned because I have no idea what the hell they're talking about. I love their body just the way it is. They KNOW I like their birth parts, which they also enjoy having. Then they said they want to stop having sex with me so at least they chose not to have sex, because we don't have it enough, and when I got upset about that because that makes no sense to me they just kept popping off on me. I brought up that I had desperately wanted to get a hotel just a couple of nights before that so we could have some time away from our roommates (who are causing us a lot of stress) and spend some quality time together having sex and bonding, and that THEY had been the one who didn't want to do that because they didn't feel like it, as proof that my initiation of sex had nothing to do with their gender at all, and they started attacking me on that for ""making them feel bad"" or whatever.

I'm so fucking lost. I don't know what to do. I don't know how to help my partner. I feel like I'm losing them. No matter what I do it doesn't seem to be enough to pull them out of this funk, and then I get frustrated and distant and things get worse. I feel like every day I wake up to a completely different person. Either they're feeling good and we have a great day or they're in some deep funk and it feels like they're hunting for something to be angry or upset over. To makes matters worse, I'm mentally ill (bipolar, medicated) so every day is already a struggle for me to maintain my waning stability, and when the shit hits the fan like this my suicidal ideation kicks in because I feel like a worthless pile of dirt who can't make my partner happy, and I have to keep us afloat while my own mind is trying to drown me.

We're going to therapy starting in May but I need help NOW before we continue to spiral.  I know I'm fucking everything up, I just don't know where to start.

So I have this friend who I sometimes fool around with. It started off with just foreplay, specifically me pleasuring her (something I enjoy even if I ""get nothing out of it""). However, the last time we hung out we decided to have penetrative sex. 
I am genderqueer AMAB and don't mind this type of sex most of the time, however as soon as we started she said something along the lines of ""your dick is amazing""... This was okay at first, but as we started to get going and she kept commenting about my penis I lost the moment... This isn't the first time I have lost an erection during sex so I knew how to keep thing enjoyable and she didn't mind that I switched to other types of sex until I got hard again.

For me the sex was just okay, but the way she talks about it you would think my penis was the best thing ever. Just today (3 months later) I got a message telling me she was thinking about my penis.

My work actually knows about my two partners, I brought them to my company Christmas party this last year.

So I want to change my name to Skylar Sally-Jane Smith.

130,2018-03-26 01:51:52,875juc,1,3,"I had an experience tonight that raised some questions, and brought me here to see if there are answers. I'll talk about the experience further below.

A little background... 

I'm phenotypically male, 27, and heterosexual - although I can't say for sure that I wouldn't be flexible, as sometimes the thought of homosexual intimacy seems intriguing, and sometimes disgusting (in the literal, visceral reaction sense of the word, no negative connotations!).

I can remember ever since discovering my sexuality,  that I have from time to time been fascinated by what it would feel like to be female. The interest in what having boobs would feel like faded quite quickly, but I still occasionally think about how having female genitalia, being vaginally penetrated (though I've never much liked the thought of a penis in my ass), and having a full-body orgasm would feel.

Well tonight, lying still in bed, sexual imagery began to float through my mind, as it is wont to (a masturbating woman, if you must know), and I started becoming more and more aroused. As the imagery shifted to a woman being penetrated, I began to imagine how I would feel if I were being penetrated, and somehow, flexing my pelvic muscles in synchronisation with the mental thrusting rhythm tricked my brain into believing that I was really being fucked - in my vagina! It quickly became obvious that endorphins were being released, and pretty soon I had an incredibly intense, full-bodied experience, that I can only imagine must have been the elusive ""female"" orgasm - it was an intense tingling sensation throughout my body -  vastly more tingly than a male orgasm -  that pulsed for about two or three seconds, then had a short aftershock about 5 seconds later that was a bit less intense. It felt nothing like an ordinary male orgasm, and outshone even the strongest ones I have ever had. It came on very strongly and faded quite quickly, leaving a warm, endorphin afterglow. I didn't ejaculate - it felt as if this type of physical sensation was happening along an entirely different biochemical framework.

Well... Assuming what happened was at least somewhat like the female orgasm experience, I've come to believe that perhaps a Y chromosome doesn't have enough sway to prohibit what would typically be a female-only experience. It seems that these are in the realm of the experience of humans, not of males or of females. Experience is after all, just in the mind, and a high testosterone to estrogen ratio isn't apparently enough to lock this particular endogenous experience out. 

At the very least, I am happy to have discovered a new door to human experience that I'm keen to open again sometime. 

Now I would like to add, I do not have any gender dysphoria. I'm quite comfortable in my physical, social, and sexual gender expression as a biological male. I have never felt the need to hold onto any cultural, social, political, or sexual classification for my sense of identity - I am what I am and I am content with being so.

Nevertheless, I am interested to know if this kind of experience has a classification in non-binary/genderfluid/genderqueer terms. 

If you had to choose a label, do you know of any that might fit? Keeping in mind that identity and gender expression mean little to me - I'm just interested about ways to examine my internal world.

This whole journey began when I first watched Queer as Folk in 2014 upon graduating high school. My reaction to the show was jealousy and a want to be like those gay men. I didn‚Äôt understand why I specifically identified with the men and not the lesbians. Or really any lesbian. I started questioning whether I was transgender (ftm) until I did some research about found gender neutral cause I still like to wear girly clothes. That is until recently. 
I‚Äôve recently begun finally accepting my gender difference and been completely out about it. But the more one I become open about my identity, going by Mick and not McKenzie, and using they pronouns, the more I dislike being a girl and the more being a guy becomes a more comfortable idea. I thought that if I came out as gender neutral I‚Äôd be more okay with either gender. Well that did not happen. 
Now I avoid girls clothes, dress more masculine, and wear binders more often. I‚Äôve considered top surgery which is definitely happening, which is new because I used to be complacent about my chest. I never liked how big they were but now I just hate them. 
I feel like all of a sudden I‚Äôm so uncomfortable with every girly thing about myself. It‚Äôs just all so confusing. I don‚Äôt understand how I can be totally okay being a girl and then all of a sudden just really hate it. 
It‚Äôs hard to tell whether being a girl was ever really me because of the controlling environment i grew up in. I always had a gnawing sense that I wasn‚Äôt being myself and I just couldn‚Äôt understand it. I knew in childhood I used to have dreams of becoming a boy for a day, but at the same time would enjoy the color pink.

It‚Äôs just difficult to tell what I want as far as transition if I can‚Äôt even get my gender right.

142,2018-03-27 23:27:42,87n7dt,16,20,"Hey everyone. So I've been on T for almost 7 months now (I am AFAB). I can't believe the time has flown by that quickly. I identify as transmasc and non-binary and prefer they/them pronouns. Usually I describe myself as 60% neutral, 40% male. 

Recently, I'm pretty much consistently passing as male and am addressed by he/him pronouns automatically. When I first started passing, it was exciting even though I don't identify as male. Just being seen as something other than female that I identified with more was satisfying enough. However, now that people who I just meet in public/don't know me keep seeing me as male, it is making me uncomfortable. 

I would much prefer they/them pronouns, and I have a pin on my backpack that has the pronouns on it. I'm thinking about wearing the pin on my shirt more, but idk what else to do from here. It's hard to expect people to ask for pronouns instead of just assuming/using they/them for everyone until knowing them better. I know that won't happen. I just can't see myself correcting people constantly, especially people I don't know. 

On top of that, although I am happy with the changes I have gotten from T so far, I'm feeling iffy now that I'm 100% seen as male. I feel the need to express more femininity or look more queer or something, idk. I'm sure this is because I'm not being seen exactly as I want to be seen. I know going off of T would reverse some changes that I still want, but now I'm starting to consider at least lowering the dose a bit so things happen more slowly.

150,2018-03-28 20:46:42,87vf20,1,19,"Hi all,

As of late, I've been having so much dysphoria about my chest.  For the past 5 years or so I've been identifying as a butch lesbian and before that I was easily a feminine tomboy.  

I've finally made steps on acknowledging how I really feel, which is transmasculine.  I'm 27 and for a majority of my life, I grew up wishing I was a boy and eventually suppressed all those feelings and emotions as I became a teenager because I really thought it was something I would grow out of.  

When I met my girlfriend, I identified as a straight girl and didn't even think about having relationships with women.  This was in 2010 and over the past 8 years, I've watched myself grow and become more comfortable in being who I really am - a person who is transmasculine and genderqueer.

I've realized that I don't necessarily feel transgendered or have any interest in living my life as a man, but I'm also so detached from femininity that I don't really feel like a woman either. 

I have my first therapy session today with a therapist who specializes in gender identity with the ultimate goal of having top surgery.  I ordered my first binder from gc2b this past weekend and it should arrive on Friday.  

I set up a consultation with a surgeon in my area to discuss my options for moving forward with top surgery.  My insurance does cover a surgery as this and in the most ideal situation, I would be able to get a letter from my therapist to give to my surgeon so it would be covered.  I'm not sure about all of that yet but it's been great to make progress and stop hiding and censoring my feelings of my true identity.

I'm happy I've found this subreddit as I've been following a lot more nonbinary and transmasculine people and the support from everyone has been wonderful!

6,2018-03-03 01:19:42,81kxer,7,16,"I realized I was non binary last year. Was having a really awesome time transitioning. Felt tons of gender euphoria and like I had finally figured out something that had been just underneath the surface my entire life. I knew that although I was currently presenting more male so that others are more likely to see me more correctly (as either a guy or at least visibly queer/trans), my style preferences are actually pretty feminine, and I was waiting until HRT took a bit more effect to go back to fem stuff.

And then I woke up a couple of weeks ago, and I was a woman. In the span of perhaps a day or two, I went from complete confidence in my identity as non binary (which had lasted an entire year with many hints before I realized, so I was confident it wasn't a phase), to complete confidence that I was now a woman. It feels like my feelings, my dysphoria and euphoria and everything, have completely changed - not like I am reinterpreting my existing feelings. It feels nothing like when I realized I was non binary - when I realized that, lots of past thoughts and feelings made more sense, because I had always been non binary. Now, looking back I don't feel I was wrong when I felt those things - I was actually just non binary at that time.

I hope the following doesn't offend anyone here, but I had always been a bit confused as to how genderfluid people come to be. The scientific explanation that trans people had a variation during fetal development that caused their brain to develop differently from their body makes a ton of sense and is pretty well supported. Although I couldn't figure out why genderfluid people would exist, I certainly trusted that they did and that their experiences were real and valid. But now I feel completely taken aback, because technically speaking I'm now both cis and genderfluid - two things I didn't think I would ever be when I was feeling confident and secure in my gender for so long.

When I was having doubts because of bigoted things people said or people not believing my gender was real before, I would ask myself, ask that little inner almost subconscious voice, what gender am I? And I would always get the same answer. Neither male nor female. It was really comforting to know that no matter what anyone thought of me, I was real and I was valid, and that being non binary was a Real Thing and I was One of Them. Now when I ask that voice, it says I am a woman. Even when I was having my worst doubts and low self esteem and self hatred, that voice always held the truth for me.

I still don't believe I was repressed or delusional then - or now. I was non binary. Now I'm a woman. I'm not sad about any of the transition steps I took - I love my new name and I don't mind my friends using neutral pronouns.

It's really weird being a woman after not being one for the first 23 years of my life. I want things I've never wanted before, with regards to my body and things I want to try and what I want to look like and what I want others to assume about me when they see me. I've stopped HRT for the moment while I see where this whole being a woman thing goes.

So shortly after that I ordered myself a skirt to indulge on my fem days. I eventually showed it to my mother and significant other. But I've never worn it in front of anyone and I otherwise continued to wear male clothing.

Last week I ordered another (longer) skirt, a pair of knit cable stockings, and a lace-backed cami with a flowy front. I am excited about them, but I realized I wanted panties to go with them.

So I took the next step today and ordered a six pack of panties with cute colors and simple patterns. I'm excited and terrified. I don't even know why I'm scared. I know I will feel BEAUTIFUL in them, but the fact I'm branching out and acknowledging BOTH sides of myself in my clothes makes my hands shake.

27,2018-03-20 17:14:26,85ugdx,4,13,"Hii everybody. I'll try to keep this short, but who knows. 

So I'm a woman. That's what I was assigned at birth, and that's what I'm perfectly happy with being a good 90-95% of the time. I am sexually attracted to other women, and the occasional man, and I'm perfectly okay with all of this. I'm happy looking pretty.

Except when I'm not. 

Because sometimes, I'll wake up, and just feel... different. Feel like putting on my usual pretty sweaters and makeup and messy bun doesn't feel good like it usually does. I'll feel like speaking in my usual high-pitched voice sounds wrong, and like presenting myself as a femme feels forced or fake. In summary, I feel more masculine. I don't know if I feel like a guy, but I definitely don't feel like a girl.

It's so frustrating, because I don't think I look good presenting myself as more masculine. My face is too round, my hair is too long, and my voice is too soft...I look like a little girl playing dress-up. 
But the simple act of putting on a too-tight sports bra and some sweatpants can make me feel so much more at ease on these types of days. Even if I know I'm not fooling anybody, I feel like maybe, just maybe, I'm fooling myself if I walk a little different, talk a little different, dress a little different on these types of days. 

Periods of time like this can last for weeks, or just a day or two. I never know what it's gonna be. It never lasts long enough for me to feel justified in going by ""they/them"" during this time. But it's enough to give me anxiety over the matter, and over how I present myself. 

It just feels weird how I can be so comfortable being a ""She"" 90% of the time, but not be comfortable with it at all in these weird little waves. Does anyone else experience something like this? 

In summary, could I be genderfluid?

from what I'm feeling I've kind of come to the conclusion of being genderfluid. I never identify as a woman nor a man, but basically everything that's in between. Some days/weeks I feel dysphoria some days/weeks I don't. I'm afab, most of the time I feel like I'm more on the male or neutral side of the gender spectrum, but it varies.  I usually dress in quite an androgynous way, bind most days or at least wear a sports bra. I usually am perceived as female, only occasionally in winter with hats and winter clothing that hide my silhouette people will say ""he"". I'm pronoun indifferent, I don't really care about them. In English I like they, which sadly doesn't exist in my mother tongue, so I usually just go by the female pronouns because I'm used to it and usually perceived as a woman. 

All this said I've recently been struggling with the differentiation between gender and style/personality. 
I really don't know where one ends and the other begins... 
Could it be that it's just my style or my personality? but why would I feel dysphoria about my chest then? But if it's gender why don't I really care about pronouns used and how people perceive me?

I'm so confused - to an extent that I'm even doubting the existence of the gender spectrum...

Am I just a woman, a tomboy and don't care much about the concept of gender and gender roles?
or am I a genderfluid person?

I'm so confused. Where does gender begin and personality end? 

What do you think? Have you experienced anything like that / had thoughts like this?

Let me start off by saying I'm glad I found this subreddit along with several others.  I have been with my spouse for a year and a half married, 2 years before that.  She has always been much outgoing and accepting than I am due to how she was raised.  I was very closeted my entire life and am only now starting to open up and see and accept all that is around me happily.

Recently (a couple months ago) I was informed that my spouse identifies as gender fluid, leaning more female.  This was the first time I'd heard of gender fluid, but regardless I was patient and listened and support her as much as I can.  I'm still learning about the gender spectrum myself, but the past few weeks it seems she has been depressed more than usual and I know she has made at least 1 comment about her gender dysphoria and wanting to buy more mens clothes, which we have started doing.

My main question: Is there anything I can do or say to help support her through her times of depression or dysphoria?  Even simple things like just a comment in the morning or afternoon?  I am still learning about terminology and she has been so wonderful in patiently explaining things when I'm uncertain but I don't want to make her feel like I just want answers all the time.

Like, suddenly it's second guessing my choices, as I'm noticing some of my fashion choices are mimicing my own mothers.  some of my own attitude shifts these past number of months, from a stay on the couch do-nothing-but-watch-tv like my dad to an out-and-about-fabulous-full-of-life-person like my mom.  and just, like, it's all somehow false the choices I'm wanting to make just because I can make an analogy to my mom and dad.  but, like, who wants to be their mom, right?

I don't really know where to start, but I figured that finding a subreddit somewhat appropriate and at least *try* to explain my confusing feelings would be a good idea. (The following two paragraphs contain some backstory, you can skip them if you like!)

It was almost a year ago that I started getting feelings that confused me a lot. Some days I was really sad and could do nothing but think about all of these feelings and other days I barely noticed them at all. Instead of really trying to figure out what **all** of these feelings meant I decided to tackle them one at the time, so to speak.

This resulted in me figuring out that I'm bisexual, something I then carried around for months but still felt really confused about up until recently, maybe a few weeks back, when I just embraced that and I no longer feel weird when I think of myself as bisexual. I'd say it feels kind of nice to have sorted that out, at least.

But with that sorted, other feelings and concerns came back to me and the last few days have been awful. When I went to bed yesterday I cried myself to sleep because my head being full of confusing feelings. At first I thought that I might just be making all of these things up in my head, but it didn't make sense since it got me so sad. I'll try and get to the point now:

I was born with male genitalia. I've never felt odd about others calling me 'he' or being referred to as 'male'. I've been at peace with my body and gender up until that time almost a year ago when I couldn't get the thoughts about it off my mind. I did lots of research on trans and all that meant but I didn't feel like that fit in on my feelings. I don't feel like I'm trapped inside a body I can't identify with, and so on.

These feelings got back to me a few days ago and I remembered a term I saw when looking up trans, which was **bi-gender**. I read about it, found a subreddit for that term but then I ended up here, because maybe this is more appropriate, as I mentioned before.

I mostly feel at peace with my body and being called 'he' and such things, but I recently been wanting to look more feminine because that's what I've been feeling like lately. Like, I've had feelings saying that I want to look more feminine, if that makes sense. I guess I've wanted to do things that *I* consider ""girly"". For instance, I had this really strong impulse to try make-up, something I've never felt or thought of before. Well, I did try it, and although it felt slightly odd or 'forbidden', I liked it. Whenever I've looked in the mirror the last few days I've thought ""would I look good as a girl?"" and then I've tried making my hair in different ways (one good thing with having long hair, heh) and well, yeah. I even shaved of my bad excuse of a beard, which I'd been trying to grow for months now, because I didn't want my face to have that masculine look to it.

I suppose that all I wanted with this post was to hear if anyone here has had similar experiences/feelings and perhaps share them with me, or possibly to help me figure out what I am feeling? I'm sort of afraid that my mind is playing tricks on me and that all these feelings aren't real...

currently seeking support and help with gender issues.

I have taken the first step on the path of gender movement towards what makes sense to me and feels right. I was a bit surprised I found it dizzying and overwhelming and I‚Äôm not in the best shape because of it just stressed out etc not quite myself.

I feel pretty silly about the whole mess and right now wouldn‚Äôt mind just having a professional tell me its ok to do what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm not just being silly/wasting everyone‚Äôs time/ and ruining a good relationship with my boyfriend of 6 months.

I‚Äôm assigned male at birth and pretty much feeling the Genderfluid vibes right now but my bf wants to see me as a man I think, which is 1 barrier. but personally i still have lots of barriers and scary areas i shudder to think about in my head so i can‚Äôt get my story straight eh. i owe my bf an explanation about my gender but i also just need to know for myself what is up.

The reason I say genderfluid is because I don‚Äôt really believe in gender as much more than a social construct (i acknowledge the difference between the sexes) and I believe in being able to express as any gender. Do I have dysphoria? big question on my mind. I certainly feel locked into my assigned gender and I feel a certain sorrow about not being able to be myself because of limitations. But I‚Äôm not into just going into a new gender where I have said limitations. Even non-binary sounds like limitations. I want to be able to act like a girl, boy, neither, or both, constantly because i just feel like that‚Äôs who I am.

Regarding all of this i‚Äôm kind of afraid of being boxed into the trans female role as what I‚Äôve been exposed to it as. I don‚Äôt feel strongly that i‚Äôm the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù gender for my body or was ‚Äúa girl all along‚Äù even though I feel like I could have been way more authentic if I was allowing myself to renounce my male-ness by doing whatever I want without worrying what gender that makes me.

But I have a problem. It's my male ego, an air balloon, that is tied to me. It pulls me up to the surface, where I thrash about. I see other men with wings, flying in the air. Many of them expect me to be able to fly too. They tell me I am a man and that I am intelligent. This fills my air balloon with more air and makes it more difficult to sink back into the water out of earshot of their banter.

If I really want to, I can imitate them by squirting all my water out like a rocket and flying among them, an awe-inspiring sight indeed. But I have no wings like they do, and I quickly fall back to the water, exhausted, having spent all my energy.

Back to thrashing about on the waves.

When I cry, my air balloon deflates, and I can sink into freedom again.

When I get horny, I fill back up with water.

And then there are those weird times like today when I'm burdened with a balloon full of turbulent air, yet also held strong in girlmode, a lump of water ballooning on the ocean's surface, a big wave, both male and female.

Today I am a big wave.

68,2018-03-30 19:18:13,88cxsr,1,15,"tldr; scared of coming out/being myself

Hi there.
I'm Morgan, turnin' 20 this year. I am a biological female.
I've been struggling with my gender identity since forever. When I was 4-8 years old I would lash out and cry to my parents that ""it's their fault I'm not a boy"". I would not wear my shirt, I'd do all the ""boy's"" activities such as climbing trees, playing with trucks, playing football but I also loved throwing tea parties for my dolls and teddies. At the age of 12 I got ""outed"" if I might say so - one of my classmates yelled out loud during religion classes that ""MORGAN THINKS SHE'S A BOY"" and the teacher... Well.
I tried to be as girly as possible, but that didn't go well. I felt terrible, getting more and more depressed. I got diagnosed with depression, anxiety and bpd but never thought that part of my shitty feelings could be caused by dysphoria. 
At the age of 16 I started thinking about my identity. I claimed the label of ""Genderfluid"" which actually felt right.
As of now I'm out to all of my friends and some of my mates. Every time they refer to me with he/him my cheeks hurt from smiling. She/her doesn't bother me, same as they/them, they're perfectly fine.
I live in a country where even gay folks are screwed. I'm scared to talk about myself per he/him out loud because someone can hear me. My parents don't know, neither my mates that I meet every day. I'm planning on starting university in London in 2019 - even the application form has the gender option such as ""non binary"". But it's a year, even year and a half apart.
I don't want to come out bc I don't want to experience that kind of stress. I just don't know really what to do or how to do. When I see comments even from LGBT+ folks that feeling the way I'm feeling is a mental disorder I just wanna roll into small bun and die under my blanket.
Do you have any experiences similar to mine that you want to share? I'm just looking for any sort of conformation, advice maybe. Thank you anyway.",genderfluid,Insecurities and storytime,1522462693.0,"{'created_utc': 1522437493, 'id': '88cxsr', 'num_comments': 1, 'score': 15, 'selftext': 'tldr; scared of coming out/being myself\n\nHi there.\nI\'m Morgan, turnin\' 20 this year.

71,2018-03-31 12:18:58,88i9oc,2,14,"TL:DR Took me 21 years to realise I was gender fluid, started owning it, feel better.


I'm not sure how to structure this, but this is my journey and I only actually realised it was a journey very recently, so I'm posting this to get my head around it and hopefully for others to look at and feel less alone in their experience as I have done with other posts on here.


My first memory of wanting to be a girl, I was about 8 or 9 and it was accompanied by my first experience of gender dysphoria. I have no idea how long it lasted, but I didn't realise it wasn't 'normal' or that it was worth talking about to anyone. 

When I was 11 I chose to play netball as a school sport, the only 'boy' to do so, I didn't want to play the masculine sports and I wanted to blend in with the girls. But I still didn't realise what it was.
Sometime around here, I began having somewhat regular dreams of being a girl, and then quite regular daydreaming about being a girl, the latter having continued to this day.


Throughout my teenage years I went through periods of never thinking about it and periods of it being big, depressing, secret thing that I struggled with silently. But I had still not learnt enough about gender identity to recognise what it was.
Whenever I got drunk and spotted myself in a mirror I often would barely recognise the image staring back because I did not identify with the sex of the person looking back. I just laughed about it and totally failed to explain to friends what that was like. 

At 16 I met a bi girl, who is now my wife, and her love for me created a buffer for my dysphoria. 

There was a party where my girlfriend and a couple of others thought it would be fun to dress up another male friend in a dress and do his make up and I so badly wanted it to be me, but could not own my identity enough to speak up, or imagine how I would explain it to anyone there. 

As an adult my girlfriends understanding of her sexuality produced periods where she identified as lesbian, which prompted me to experience more intense periods of dysphoria. A few times I expressed to her that I wished I was a girl so that she could have a partner of her preferred sex.  But didn't really explain that her preference was not responsible for this wish, just relevant or contributing.

Earlier this year, my wife came out as a lesbian, which is complicated enough on it's own, but it inspired me to look at my own identity and follow her in her braveness and begin to express my femininity.
I have never felt so body positive in my life and feel better about practically everything. 
I'm making small changes but it feels like a flood, I've started wearing women's jeans in public, shaving my legs, painting my nails and I'm getting laser hair removal done on my facial hair!
My wife bought me some pretty leggings style pyjamas that I wear at home and could not be more supportive.


I have missed so many opportunities to express myself and explore my identity, I have only just super recently realised what a colossal fuck-up it was to not own this identity earlier.

I think I wasn't okay with it, it was more like an internal problem to be ignored than anything else. 
I also figured I'll never be a girl, so there's no point bringing it up. Never occurred to me that I could embrace a more feminine presentation or behaviour and that that would be better than pretending it was a phase or insignificant.",genderfluid,"29 AMAB, only just begun acknowledging I'm genderfluid this year.",1522523938.0,"{'created_utc': 1522498738, 'id': '88i9oc', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 14, 'selftext': ""TL:DR Took me 21 years to realise I was gender fluid, started owning it, feel better.\n\n\nI'm not sure how to structure this, but this is my journey and I only actually realised it was a journey very recently, so I'm posting this to get my head around it and hopefully for others to look at and feel less alone in their experience as I have done with other posts on here.\n\n\nMy first memory of wanting to be a girl, I was about 8 or 9 and it was accompanied by my first experience of gender dysphoria.
