I am a shy, feminine presenting androgyne and it took me forever to figure out I was not ""just"" trans and it is ok to like my penis. My friends were all rather truscum and said lots of shitty things, making it difficult. I've come out because my suffering around this and have been mostly ghosted by them.  


I know I shouldn't have gotten surgery, and don't deny for a second that it helps the people who do want it. So, please don't debate the ethics of regretting surgery. It's happened and that's that. I feel quite certain in my feelings around it, so please don't try to get me to accept things as they are. I don't regret having a vagina, but I deeply regret losing my penis. As such, I want to retain it with whatever route I take.  


I think metoidioplasty would be the ideal pick because I don't like large penises much anyway. I doubt I'd be capable of penetrating with that but aesthetically I like the results better than the phalloplasty results I've seen. Plus I don't want a pump but do want to become erect. A true fantasy option would be a transplant but I don't think that's available yet, especially in a form that is safe from rejection. I can barely find info on what my options are. Most ""detransition"" options are very binary and I don't want to detransition. I just want my girl's penis back.  


I would've went the vaginal agenesis route without question if I had known it existed at the time. It really hurts to know I'll never have the life I truly wanted to have. People finally started really admitting they liked people like me just like I did something I can never take back to be ""normal"" and I cry about it every day.

7,2018-08-01 21:17:02,93t48r,8,13,"So that's it. I was asked a couple months ago to be in a wedding party and I said yes. It was my brothers fiancee who asked so sure. This was when I was rejecting myself internally and just going with everyone else's flow. Two months ago I finally came to terms with being NB and gay. I've known since forever but just never wanted to say anything. I came out to just myself really, because accepting it was the hardest battle for me. Not out to my family or friends in any kind of way.

I went to a dress fitting a month ago and was overwhelmed. Everyone else in the party is so feminine and was so excited to try on dresses. I was there dressed a little more masculine which I've learned it really all I've ever wanted to dress like. but I wanted to be there to support the bride so I figured I could do a dress for a day. Tried out dresses, they picked one and it was done. I was so uncomfortable. I had to spend $200 on something I don't feel comfortable in and will never wear again. They were talking about not cutting their hair until after the wedding so we could all have matching hairstyles. I have some dysphoria with having longer hair (is that a thing?) so my heart was sinking. I ran after paying. Didn't go out to eat with them because I felt such regret.

Lately I've been regretting it even more. The dresses actually had a problem so we have to go back to pick out a new style. I want to cry everytime I think about it. I don't want to be in a dress. I don't want it to emphasize any of the ""womanly"" curves I have. I want to cancel going to this wedding altogether. I probably can't even afford to go (destination wedding) The dress is non-refundable so I guess I could just let go of that $200.

 My anxiety thinking about a dress is getting worse everyday. In high school I would wear a ton of dresses to kinda make up for the rest of me not being feminine enough. So I guess that's the root of it. I don't know what to do and I don't know if I'm being selfish. I have no one to tell any of this to.

There’s not really an HR to talk to, and there’s only maybe 15 employees total anyways, including my bosses. Should I set up a meeting with my boss and just go from there?  Do I just tell people as I go along? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Coming out at work?', 'created': 1533270818.0}"

I identify as transgender and non-binary. I have feminine and masculine traits and characteristics and like to express myself and my gender in different ways. I'm afab and am not currently on HRT, nor have I had any gender reassignment surgeries. The person I am possibly pursuing a relationship with is a cis male.

The issue: So things between us have progressed and now we have a sexual relationship but nothing official at this point. He is my long-time best friend and we talked about what it would be like if we were to date (why it would/would not work). One of the things he brought up as to why it wouldn't work is that he is ""straight."" This confuses me because I am trans, not female, and yet he seems to like me?

Later it came out that even if I let some of my body hair grow he would be uncomfortable and not want to be with me.

Question: So I'm confused. He likes me now and that's flattering but also keeps saying he's straight, so I don't know whether or not I should be offended?

41,2018-08-04 03:06:52,94fypq,4,8,"I am AFAB and recently came out as androgyne, leaning masculine. I changed my name on social media and am saving up to have my name legally changed irl. I have begun correcting people who dead name and misgender me, and am getting dead named less and less. Even so, I have always hated my face and body, and in general considered myself one of ""the guys"". Growing up I justified it by stating that I was a weirdo, a freak, and a nerd, and that I simply was not meant to fit in anywhere. 
These days that excuse is simply not cutting it. I began to consider the possibility that I was not a girl when I was 15, and cut my hair short for the first time. I had been wearing male clothing for years by that point in time and was suicidal over my self-image and attraction to other girls. I hated my breasts, especially, as they were awkward and in the way, and I felt morally obligated to wear a bra. I felt completely disconnected from the bottom half of my body, however, and didn't think much of it unless I was PMSing, which is honestly the worst thing ever. I pushed all of these thoughts away throughout puberty because my family is religious, homophobic, and transphobic, and it was hard enough coming to terms with the fact that I wasn't straight let alone trans or nonbinary. 
But even though, I have come out I am still consistently being dead named and misgendered. People insist I am still a girl, despite my identifying as an androgyne. When they do, I find myself silently correcting them and becoming angry that I do not have the courage to tell them that I am not a girl. I find myself becoming furious when guys flirt with me or objectify me, though I am not sure if that is dysphoria or a natural reaction to sexism. It also amuses me to a certain degree because I consider myself more male than anything. I feel the need to behave almost gentlemanly towards the women in my life and to defend them as much as possible, which is difficult because I have social anxiety and trouble advocating for myself. Mostly, though, I am horribly confused. As an androgyne, I consider myself both male and female, but I am beginning to wonder if that is a cop out. I want to pass for male so badly, and have even considered the idea of taking T and today I purchased my first binder.

I changed my name on social media and am saving up to have my name legally changed irl. I have begun correcting people who dead name and misgender me, and am getting dead named less and less. Even so, I have always hated my face and body, and in general considered myself one of ""the guys"". Growing up I justified it by stating that I was a weirdo, a freak, and a nerd, and that I simply was not meant to fit in anywhere. \nThese days that excuse is simply not cutting it. I began to consider the possibility that I was not a girl when I was 15, and cut my hair short for the first time. I had been wearing male clothing for years by that point in time and was suicidal over my self-image and attraction to other girls. I hated my breasts, especially, as they were awkward and in the way, and I felt morally obligated to wear a bra. I felt completely disconnected from the bottom half of my body, however, and didn\'t think much of it unless I was PMSing, which is honestly the worst thing ever. I pushed all of these thoughts away throughout puberty because my family is religious, homophobic, and transphobic, and it was hard enough coming to terms with the fact that I wasn\'t straight let alone trans or nonbinary. \nBut even though, I have come out I am still consistently being dead named and misgendered. People insist I am still a girl, despite my identifying as an androgyne. When they do, I find myself silently correcting them and becoming angry that I do not have the courage to tell them that I am not a girl. I find myself becoming furious when guys flirt with me or objectify me, though I am not sure if that is dysphoria or a natural reaction to sexism. It also amuses me to a certain degree because I consider myself more male than anything. I feel the need to behave almost gentlemanly towards the women in my life and to defend them as much as possible, which is difficult because I have social anxiety and trouble advocating for myself. Mostly, though, I am horribly confused. As an androgyne, I consider myself both male and female, but I am beginning to wonder if that is a cop out. I want to pass for male so badly, and have even considered the idea of taking T and today I purchased my first binder.

I see a therapist every two weeks and while I chose her because she does have a background in transgender issue, I do not see her explicitly for gender therapy, but rather for an anxiety disorder and depression. Obviously, gender comes up sometimes, but I was urged by my mother and my partner to go to therapy following a severe panic attack I had at a family party, again, an incident that had absolutely nothing to do with my dysphoria.

One of the things we have talked about a couple of times are about my thoughts on starting HRT, which I find myself going back and forth on constantly. Most of the time, wearing ""womens clothes"" and makeup is enough to calm my dysphoria, but other times it still doesn't feel like enough. I'm almost positive that I'm still non-binary, but the appeal of looking/being read as slightly more feminine (a non-binary transwoman?) sounds amazing. I don't have genital dysphoria, I don't care if I don't grow breasts, and my voice doesn't both me, but I would love smoother/softer skin, finer/less course body hair, and the fat distribution that I've admired in FtM timelines I've seen. I've told my therapist, ""The idea of never feeling like a man again doesn't sound too bad, but the idea of never feeling like a woman sounds like a nightmare."" Of course, I also have a lot of reservations, namely what if the hormones work TOO well and I look TOO different, scaring off my partner and family.

Anyways, yesterday, something came up during our session that has really got me thinking and flung into a bit of a crisis. We talked about how my anxiety and depression have been extremely high (as in much higher than what I consider my normal level of anxiety) the past 4 or 5 days as has my dysphoria. This led to a discussion about how when I have panic attacks or when something in my life OTHER than dysphoria triggers my anxiety and/or depression, dysphoria often follows shortly afterwards.

What I've been trying to figure out is whether or not there is a correlation between the two or if I just happen to have both anxiety AND dysphoria? More importantly, might my anxiety dissipate if I start HRT? In other words, do have anxiety because my body/mind is secretly craving HRT even when I don't THINK dysphoria is to blame? Because I get anxiety from a lot of other things, not just my assigned gender. Namely, my anxiety stems from pervasive thoughts that I'm a failure, that everything I've ever done and ever will do is wrong, and that I'm a burden to everyone I come in contact with. When my anxiety is very high (as I mentioned it has been lately), I often times slap myself in the face repeatedly, pull my own hair, choke myself, and/or yell at and insult myself in the mirror. I don't really care about my own health, I have very little hope for the future, and I wake up every day thinking about how many hours before its socially acceptable for me to go back to bed, but again, these thoughts don't hinge on my dysphoria. Still, could these thoughts be an extension of dysphoria without me knowing it?

been lying around yesterday and thinking about things again and would like to know what you folks think.

What are your desires and what would be the best way (realistic or not) to fulfill them?

Do you feel like you are mostly desiring what you don't have, sometimes even in extreme ways?

As I'm aware that I tend to post questions in a survey like style, I just start by answering the questions from my perspective:

I feel like my normal, every day desires are mostly paused. I don't really know how to proceed with life (in a sense of moving forward) until I resolved how my gender works. Regarding gender, I'd wish to have shape-shifting powers (I know, unrealistic), even just minor, like changing the distribution of fat. As this isn't really working that way, I want to be somewhat ambiguous, so that at least an accentuation of some features is possible.

For the second question, I definitely tend to desire what I don't have and I wonder if it would just vanish when I achieved it or if it would just be substituted by a bigger goal. 

For example, on the days I'm more feminine leaning, I definitely want a more feminine body, even though I know I'm not IDing as female. It feels weird, because I desire to look like a tomboy, but would that change to femme if I achieved the tomboyish look? I'm not even sure I want a body like that as it seems to be an exaggeration of wanting to be more feminine/being accepted while being more feminine?

I'm sure someones made a post similar to this before but... I've been struggling a lot lately with cashiers (and other people in public who I only see for a brief moment of time) as far as whether or not I should correct them about my pronouns. 

I use they/them pronouns exclusively with people who know me, it's been a fairly new transition  (the last 6 months) but now that people I'm close with rarely misgender me, its becoming a lot more obvious and sort of creates some  dysphoria when people say things like ""thanks lady (miss, girl, insert other femme terms)"". I've started wearing pins that say they/them on it. But I don't always remember to put them on and also it bothers me that I have to put a badge on myself just to get people to know. I think it's hard because I definitely present super femme, but I dress how I feel comfortable and I don't think I should have to try and look more masc just to get people to respect my pronouns. 

Anyways I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to address people publicly... I was thinking of maybe just saying like ""oh hey I'm actually non-binary"" or if maybe its not worth it esp when I probably won't see these people again...

I have established some constants throughout my games in terms of races sex, reproduction, and gender.

Drakin (Dragonborn) in my setting can change sex based on the need of the community (if there are not enough egg layers then the hormones of some will change) and Avians (Aarakroca), males have more show feathers and are more brightly colored. Elves have thousands of recognized genders but there is very little difference based on hormones (all fall into a more androgynous appearance based on human standards) .

In this draft of the guide I am using two entries for each race ""Sexual Dimorphism""  to go over typical difference based on hormones and reproduction and discuss and ""Gender Variation"" to go over more of the social roles and views of gender and personal identification and expression.

I've intellectually accepted that I'm somewhere outside my assigned-gender-at-birth, and the enby label feels right for me right now... BUT I'm really unsure about how I feel and what the dimensions of my gender actually are. 

Sometimes I feel like a girl, especially when I see women's bodies (like at the gym) I want to be more like them. I want to wear a sportsbra and leggings (I do wear leggings, and nail polish, but I'm read as male every day and I've lived as a man my whole life).  On the other hand, I don't really want boobs and I'm fine with the downstairs equipment I have.... and I don't *really* think I experience dysphoria?? (Except lately I'm really hating my facial hair and I need a new haircut and my face is just... my face i don't have any feelings about it i guess. But in the past I've loved having rough stubble ). 

I'm stuck feeling as though I might have a girlish side to explore, but I'm both: a) terrified of opening that door and being ""really trans"" (which I recognize is a medicalist/problematic opinion, and I'm trying to stop thinking it, but it still makes me afraid), and b) afraid that by exploring and claiming labels like ""trans woman"", ""transfeminine"", or even ""gay/lesbian"" (since if I'm a woman that makes me gay??) I'm doing a really bad thing by *appropriating* the experiences of women and gay/lesbian people and nobody in the queer community will accept me because I haven't lived that struggle and I'm not actively trying to look more high-femme or medically transition (yet?). 

**Just generally feeling stuck... TL;DR:** 

\- Not sure how to deal with huge washing amounts of fear I get when thinking about if I'm a nonbinary woman or maybe a trans woman (which i basically lock down automatically in my brain, I can't even open that up to rly feel it out, i can only handle it at an intellectual level right now) 

\- not sure how to deal with the guilt of feeling like I'm stepping on other people's identities and stealing their hard-earned labels. This is a really big one right now

\- not sure if what I feel is a part of my nonbinaryness (maybe I'm a demigirl who's happy to be in a masc-ish body) or if I'm actually a trans woman in severe repressed denial

I\'m doing a really bad thing by *appropriating* the experiences of women and gay/lesbian people and nobody in the queer community will accept me because I haven\'t lived that struggle and I\'m not actively trying to look more high-femme or medically transition (yet?). \n\n**Just generally feeling stuck... TL;DR:** \n\n\\- Not sure how to deal with huge washing amounts of fear I get when thinking about if I\'m a nonbinary woman or maybe a trans woman (which i basically lock down automatically in my brain, I can\'t even open that up to rly feel it out, i can only handle it at an intellectual level right now) \n\n\\- not sure how to deal with the guilt of feeling like I\'m stepping on other people\'s identities and stealing their hard-earned labels. This is a really big one right now\n\n\\- not sure if what I feel is a part of my nonbinaryness (maybe I\'m a demigirl who\'s happy to be in a masc-ish body) or if I\'m actually a trans woman in severe repressed denial\n\nTHANK YOU &lt;3 😭 if i should\'ve posted this in a different subreddit (is /r/trans a thing?) plz let me know', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': ""AMAB Enby...struggling with how to know what kind of NB is true for me and if it's OK"", 'created': 1533970234.0}"

I'm a 15 years old AMAB and for a while I've been asking myself whether I'm non-binary or not.

I'm not the typical ""masculine man"" and I'm VERY much comfortable hanging out with girls than with boys, but I'm not sure if I would like to be treated as a girl neither. I mean, I guess I don't care, but I would prefer not to.

I mean, I guess I don\'t care, but I would prefer not to. I also would like to be able to wear some makeup without being self-conscious about it, but I also wouldn\'t like wearing things like dresses all day.\n\nThe thing is, I don\'t know if I\'m gender non-conforming or non-binary. I\'ve been thinking about it a lot but I can\'t find an answer. It would help me a lot if you share your opinions on this.

I'm a social worker who works with lots of different clients a lot of whom have high levels of cognitive decline. Today a client commented on my nail polish and said ""are you some kind of poofter??"" and then said ""you have dyed hair but I don't know what you have in your pants"". And I just had to say ""Um excuse me."" and quickly move on. 

Then I had to be alone for a while and found that it gave me a lot of intense feelings and I just wanted to share them. Clients say all sorts of things when you work with them sometimes personal things, but this got me for some reason, in a way that I could not laugh off. 

When I was younger I used to like appearing quite androgynous, I had long hair and didn't have much body hair. I was often mistaken for a girl which I didn't like and very occasionally people in pick up trucks would yell the F word at me when I was walking home from school which obviously made me very uncomfortable. I feel like I retreated, instead of trying to figure out who I was I retreated into what I saw as the social safety of masculinity.  

It was more the social dysphoria that really made me stressed and depressed. I lived in a university college and the toxic masculinity that surrounded me and the things that male residents would say to me because they saw me as a dude (along the lines of 'hey man we gotta get you laid', um no thank you/I don't have time to get into everything wrong with what you just said to me). 

It was only after university that I really 'discovered' the enby world, and it just explained a lot for me. I had been going around calling myself bi, which I thought was what my deal was, and it allowed me to express a certain aspect of my queerness which was fine but it also felt a little bit dishonest to myself. 

I had to unpack a lot of my own queerphobia when it came to being genderqueer, 'am I just doing this to avoid addressing my complicity in hegemonic masculinity?' 'is this just a fashion?' all of that, before arriving at the conclusion that I think a lot of people come to which is namely that cishet people don't lose sleep over presenting as cishet, and that it's ok to be fucking confused all day.

Fast forward to now, and being my colourful queer self trying to help people, and those feelings that made me retreat into my masculinity when I was younger really came flooding back today.

omg that was only 4 days ago? it feels like a month

when i wrote that post i was having a rly hard time, feeling tons of feelings about my gender and it felt super real and immediate and important. but on sunday and thru to now, i feel... none of that. im totally blank and i have no sense of my internal feelings about gender, or anything. I look in the mirror and tell myself ""hey you're nonbinary, it's cool, you got this"" but I don't really feel like it's \_real\_. It's just words.

Anyone else have a complicated history of feeling their dysphoria inducing body parts were cancerous and have a history of trouble separating those fears and delusions from their underlying gender dysphoria?

At age 12 or 13 when I first started experiencing gender dysphoria, I was also convinced most of the time I was terminally ill with strong suicidal ideations that I avoided only through heavy disassociation and obsessive compulsive hyper religiosity. It was specifically penile and testicular cancer that I was obsessed with, only when I had a mental health breakdown at age 20 did I get hospitalized and convinced I was cancer free. 

It is real embarrassing to admit this but I interpreted the discoloration on the underside of my penis raphe and testicles as cancerous which was rapidly metastasizing from there throughout my body. But where my dysphoria comes in is that I held out a slim chance that the cancer had not spread I could get the cancerous tissue removed and have a vaginoplasty with what skin remained/skin grafts from elsewhere. 

Looking back on it this was a weird type of forced feminization fantasy, an exception that I rationalized God and my Roman Catholic birth faith would allow me to transition from male to female without excommunication. Although from ages 20 to 30 I wasn’t hypochondriac, I was still depressed and often suicidal due to my still repressed gender dysphoria while I immersed myself in Sedevacantist Traditionalist Catholicism. Only when I gave up my Catholic faith in 2016 did I start to in a way give up that repression a little and create a reddit account after being a only a lurker for about 10 years on a variety of websites/forums. I created a twitter account in March 2017, made trans friends there and finally in Oct. 2017 found out that being non-binary fit my kind of gender dysphoria. 

I’m taking my transition to a non-binary trans fem slow, attending a monthly trans and non-binary support group, using they/them pronouns there and on reddit/twitter as I’m still closeted with everyone else.

215,2018-08-16 18:15:03,97upjq,6,10,"Hi ya'll.

I guess this is a post seeking reasaurance and validation.

Some background: I am AFAB and have been identifying as nonbinary for somewhere around five months now. I just started a new job and came out to my coworkers. They all took it well, it seems. I'm fortunate.

We are currently at a kickoff event for our organization learning more about what we do and our mission. I found other nonbinary and trans folk at the event and have made connections.

What makes me feel awkward is I cannot be easily identified as enby based on looks alone and am instantly seen as a woman. Whereas many associate being nonbinary with anrogyny, I am comfortable presenting feminine. Although dressing femininely, I lack a strong self-identification as a woman.

I'm curious about coping strategies. If you feel bad, or just a bit off/wrong, how do you cope?

What do you do in certain situations, like when you are in an uncomfortable social situation, or when you are feeling internally bad?

I guess it's only reasonable to start ;)

For me it depends. If I'm feeling off or full on dysphoric about my body, I try to ignore it for a while (not putting too much attention on it). If it doesn't go away, I try to actively distract myself by reading, gaming or other stuff. If nothing else works, I try to move my body, exercise or practice complicated movements.

In social situations, I mostly suffer through it. There are some people I tell when they misstep, but as I'm not out to many people, I don't have the courage to stand up to them without being out.

It's been really tough for both of us, but in a way, it feels like just the beginning of my difficulties.  Even though she tried to understand me, she fears (and I believe reasonably so) that bad things could happen to us when other people find out about me.

I am AMAB and sort of envy the binary trans folks, as hard as their lot is.  They are considered disgusting freaks by large parts of the population, and as unfortunate as that is, they at least have the option to live in deep stealth; to have hope that they can eventually pass as what they feel like inside and be accepted.

As for me, I am an AMAB enby near the beginning of my journey of self-discovery, as you might call it.  What am I going to look like?  How will I present myself?  (I think I'm going to go for an androgyne look eventually.)

What are people going to think when they see me on the street?  I imagine that for many people, the answer is going to be that they'll think I'm a freak.  I had a dream a few nights ago that I was out and about in public wearing a dress, and several young men were aggressively stalking me and I was afraid that they were going to hurt me.

Is that my fate?  To choose between pretending to be cis because that's what everyone expects of me?  To hide who I am because society would consider me a freak?  To hide who I am because my children might get bullied at school because I am a freak?  To have beer bottles tossed at my head from moving vehicles because I am a freak?  To have the wait staff at restaurants spit in my food because I am a freak?  To end up dead on the street somewhere because my mere existence is intolerable to some people?

It just hit me recently that I am going to have to inform my FOO that I am trans.  They're not going to like it.  I would prefer that they never knew, but they are going to find out eventually.  The only thing I have control over is when and how they find out.

I wanted to take a moment to just give a big shout-out and offer my heartfelt thanks to those of you who have the courage to post selfies here on the public internet.

I am still in the closet except to my wife and a few close friends.

Some day, I'll probably do a face reveal of my own on this subreddit, but here's part of the reason that these selfies mean so much to me, and I'm sure that my feeling is shared by many.

**The selfies posted on this sub have been helping me find myself.**

You see, each one of these selfies exudes the non-binariness of the unique poster.  No two are alike. 
 I look at one selfie and recognise something about myself in it, and then I look at another selfie and it looks completely foreign to me, like the presentation would be entirely incongruent with my gender identity and expression. (but it may be absolutely perfect for the poster!)

Browsing these selfies is almost like looking at clothes and thinking about which ones I would be comfortable wearing.

As difficult as it is to imagine a presentation that would really feel comfortable for me, seeing the presentations of others helps a lot!

In an ideal world if post this on ELI5, but given the topic I feel like things might get toxic quickly if I do. 

I’m male cisgendered and heterosexual, so I’ll start with the following statement:
I can not, and do not, pretend to know what it’s like to identify as non-binary or have any other sexual preference to mine and live with the accompanying prejudice and associated emotions. In light of this, if I get terminology wrong, please don’t hurt me - I’m not trying to trigger or offend, I really would like to be educated - after all, I am playing life on ‘easy mode’. Granted my brain has never worked properly (to quite dramatic effect) and I’m a chronic pain patient after a spinal injury, but still; the world is biased towards people like me in a pretty stupid way. 

Context:
I often find that official forms have only binary options for gender, occasionally there is the option for rather not say (this seems to be unique to academic, demographic, and market - from time to time i see an ‘other’ box. 

I saw an article where someone couldn’t open a bank account because they couldn’t select a  gender other than M/F. In this situation how would react, would you rather go without a bank acct, renting a house or anything else on principal, or would you compromise?

I understand people are individuals, and I’m not assuming that there’s a spokesperson for the non-binary community!! Just would be cool to hear a few viewpoints.

315,2018-08-22 04:36:00,99acw0,7,7,"I believe that I need professional help making things work with my wife of eight years.

I came out on this group five months ago after some soul-searching.  I knew that I didn't feel right about living the rest of my life as a cisgender male, but that's what is expected of me by literally everyone I know.  I talked to my wife about this and she reluctantly allowed me to experiment with clothes inside the house around her, but she made it very clear to me that ""she married a man"", and that's what she expects me to be because she is ""very straight"".  On top of this, my parents raised me to believe that transgender people are disgusting, as I mentioned in many previous posts.

What is happening is not fair to me and it is not fair to her, but it is what it is.

It feels unfair to me that I am in a situation where it is expected that I live my life pretending to be something I'm not to make everyone else comfortable and happy, and it feels unfair to my wife that the man she thought she married is becoming something different.

I feel like we're both nibbling on opposite ends of an excrement sandwich.  And we have a small daughter between us who will have to live with the consequences of the decisions we make.

***

I asked my doctor today for a referral to a therapist who is an expert at this sort of thing.  I told her that I have gender dysphoria.  She observed that I am always anxious when I visit her office, and then she told me something that spiked my anxiety: she said that she thinks that I don't have gender dysphoria and she would refer me to someone who helped her patients avoid getting divorced.

I didn't ask for help avoiding divorce.  If divorce is the least bad solution to our problem, then so be it.  I don't want divorce and it would break my heart, but **it would hurt even more to live the rest of my life pretending that everything is fine when I feel like I'm screaming inside and no one can hear me because no one wants to hear me because everyone else wants to think that everything is fine and just carry on.**

The best outcome is that we learn to live together happily the way we are, but I can't demand that outcome because I'm not in control of everything.

***

Needless to say, I am not enthused about the referral my doctor is processing for me.  I just sent a message asking my therapist for a referral to someone who is an expert at this sort of thing, but I wanted to bring my question to this community:

335,2018-08-24 04:36:52,99uh72,20,13,"I've been reading a bit about what HRT is like for binary trans folks.  One really good description is in the essay ""Boygasms and Girlgasms"", by Julia Serano, linked here: [http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf](http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf).  It is mostly SFW and covers far more about the effects of MtF HRT than just sexuality.

I think that it's interesting that both MtF and FtM folks typically describe greater satisfaction with their sexuality after starting HRT.

Most discussion of HRT here seems to center around reshaping the body, but Serano conveys a very palpable satisfaction with how her senses have changes and how she experiences life internally.  I must admit that I feel a tinge of jealousy. ;-)  Acknowledging how I felt made me wonder if I'm actually MtF also.

I wasn't really that interested in HRT until I started reading accounts of how people change how they feel inside, not just the face in the mirror.

So... I'm wondering what experience I could expect if I start HRT as an AMAB enby.  Of course, I don't mind to hear about AFAB enby experiences, as well.

The first question that comes to mind is what HRT regimen I might possibly benefit from.  I frequently hear of MtF folks taking steps to reduce their T levels to near 0.  My understanding is that healthy cis women naturally have a significant amount of T in their bodies, just far less than men.  As someone who enjoys the outdoors, I would be very wary of dropping my T levels to 0.  And besides, I identify as enby; I think I would enjoy a more androgynous body; I'm not looking for curves to attract guys and I would like to keep the great part of my musculature.

One really good description is in the essay ""Boygasms and Girlgasms"", by Julia Serano, linked here: [http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf](http://angg.twu.net/LATEX/whipping-girl.pdf).  It is mostly SFW and covers far more about the effects of MtF HRT than just sexuality.\n\nI think that it\'s interesting that both MtF and FtM folks typically describe greater satisfaction with their sexuality after starting HRT.\n\nMost discussion of HRT here seems to center around reshaping the body, but Serano conveys a very palpable satisfaction with how her senses have changes and how she experiences life internally.  I must admit that I feel a tinge of jealousy. ;-)  Acknowledging how I felt made me wonder if I\'m actually MtF also.\n\nI wasn\'t really that interested in HRT until I started reading accounts of how people change how they feel inside, not just the face in the mirror.\n\nSo... I\'m wondering what experience I could expect if I start HRT as an AMAB enby.  Of course, I don\'t mind to hear about AFAB enby experiences, as well.\n\nThe first question that comes to mind is what HRT regimen I might possibly benefit from.  I frequently hear of MtF folks taking steps to reduce their T levels to near 0.  My understanding is that healthy cis women naturally have a significant amount of T in their bodies, just far less than men.  As someone who enjoys the outdoors, I would be very wary of dropping my T levels to 0.  And besides, I identify as enby; I think I would enjoy a more androgynous body; I\'m not looking for curves to attract guys and I would like to keep the great part of my musculature.\n\nThe second question is supposing that I adopted an HRT regimen that would keep my hormone levels somewhere between healthy male and female levels and it helped me develop a more androgynous body (a big if), how would my ""inner experience"" compare to the inner experiences of binary trans folks?\n\nAMAB enbies, what are your experiences with HRT like?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'What is HRT like for AMAB enbies?', 'created': 1535110612.0}"

I came out as NB about 6 months ago i.e. made a formal request to friends and family to use a different name and they/them pronouns; I've gotten push-back from some people because I'm very masculine presenting without much effort.

I think another part of this is growing pains associated with reclaiming my queer identity after being shoved into the ""daddy/dom"" box within the gay community.

356,2018-08-25 11:22:45,9a63ju,3,7,"Hi, sorry if I shouldn’t be posting this here but I’m just feeling anxious and sort of upset. I’ve been slowly coming to terms with my identity over the course of four years. It’s been hard, because identifying as a different gender has always been this big thing in my head compared to sexuality, so when it hit me at first that I might be agender/nonbinary I immediately shoved it away (it doesn’t help I was raised extremely conservatively). Since then, though, it never left my head. It was always in the back somewhere. It makes sense, because it is how I feel (I’m 80% sure at this point, the closest I’ve allowed myself to be this far lol).
Even before I had breasts, I remember thinking that I should enjoy lying on my chest now because I won’t be able to the same again once I grow them. I’ve always hated them, I feel fucking gross half the time when I see them (especially in swimsuits). I finally was allowed to cut my hair short and boyish, and immediately I recognized myself and felt so good. I hated having long hair so much (I recognize that this is self expression and not gender necessarily, since anyone can have long hair, but it felt like I was a ‘short hair person walking around with long hair’). I don’t often hate my bottom parts, but occasionally I’ll feel gross about them as well (but I know for certain I do *not* want a dick, I don’t want t, and I don’t feel like a man at all).
The anxiousness came back full force tonight because I saw a video of a nonbinary youtuber showing their transition through top surgery. It was a great video, and as it went on it scared me because I already knew I hate my breasts, and I *have* thought about getting them off, I’ve just tried to avoid thinking about it because that’s such a big thing to me. Seeing that video made me realize that I do want that, and it scared the shit out of me being faced full-force with that realization. I have a huge fear of both needles and surgery which doesn’t help, but that isn’t even the main fear. It’s just.. such a huge sudden change (which I don’t deal well with). And it’s permanent. I’ve had nightmares about getting *tattoos* because that idea of unalterable permanence and commitment just scares me.
At the same time though I felt relief..? I think from knowing something about how I feel for certain. It’s nice having that mental and emotional confirmation, but of course it’s mixed with the fear that something that I really really want is so *big*.

I’ve been slowly coming to terms with my identity over the course of four years. It’s been hard, because identifying as a different gender has always been this big thing in my head compared to sexuality, so when it hit me at first that I might be agender/nonbinary I immediately shoved it away (it doesn’t help I was raised extremely conservatively). Since then, though, it never left my head. It was always in the back somewhere. It makes sense, because it is how I feel (I’m 80% sure at this point, the closest I’ve allowed myself to be this far lol).\nEven before I had breasts, I remember thinking that I should enjoy lying on my chest now because I won’t be able to the same again once I grow them. I’ve always hated them, I feel fucking gross half the time when I see them (especially in swimsuits). I finally was allowed to cut my hair short and boyish, and immediately I recognized myself and felt so good. I hated having long hair so much (I recognize that this is self expression and not gender necessarily, since anyone can have long hair, but it felt like I was a ‘short hair person walking around with long hair’). I don’t often hate my bottom parts, but occasionally I’ll feel gross about them as well (but I know for certain I do *not* want a dick, I don’t want t, and I don’t feel like a man at all).\nThe anxiousness came back full force tonight because I saw a video of a nonbinary youtuber showing their transition through top surgery.

399,2018-08-27 23:08:18,9atqm4,1,9,"AFAB, first post on this subreddit!

&amp;#x200B;

I've been playing around with the idea of gender for the past 5 years, but just recently found my label: agenderflux. After a few weeks of mulling over the pros and cons of transitioning, I think I'm going to try for a FTN transition! This post is mostly just me trying to get a sounding board for where I want to go with this. I know this is an incredibly personal issue and no two transitions are the same, but I would love some input from people who deal with this issue. 

Alright, here's the master plan thus far:

1. Grow my body hair out. Just what it says on the tin, let everything go and see where it takes me. This decision is easily reversible if I end up not liking certain patches/just can't live with armpit hair. Also, my workplace is not very open for something like this (body hair on AFAB would be seen as unprofessional) so I'm going to invest in a handful of business appropriate leggings/stockings so I never have to go bare-legged to work. 
2. I've made an appointment with my favourite hairdresser in my hometown to get a gender neutral haircut that goes with my facial structure. I'll have to wait until I go home for Thanksgiving, but the wait will give me time to think if I really want to cut 2 feet off my hair. I will leave it long enough to style for a professional office space.
3. Get a binder for masculine days. My boobs are obnoxiously big (E cup) so not sure how this is going to go.
4. Invest in a more androgynous wardrobe. First off, pants are the literal devil, so only skirts for me. But I was thinking I could mix and match masculine and feminine styles and maybe buy some oversized sweaters to pair with those leggings I am buying. Either way, I want to lose about 30 pounds before I start looking to supplement my wardrobe (this number is mostly so I can feel more healthy, but also to get me down to a size range where I know I can find clothes that will fit). I've already started losing weight and am hopeful that I can be down those 30 pounds by the new year and get some new/used clothes as a Christmas present to myself. 
5. Actually learn how to use my makeup kit. I want to be able to make my face more masculine and makeup is the easiest way for me. 

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest concerns: 

I'm honestly really nervous about this whole plan. Even though I have been thinking about my gender for 5 years, and toying with the idea of transitioning for nearly 3 months, it's terrifying to actually have a plan in place. I'm mostly scared that a) I won't like the changes to my body/presentation, b) I will face a lot of ridicule for choosing to transition, and c) I will get part way through it and realize that I was kidding myself the whole time and the gender I was assigned is actually correct (this one I know isn't going to happen, but I can't seem to convince my emotions that this isn't a phase). 

The other concern I have is with my husband. He has been unbelievably accepting the entire way (his exact words were: ""It's your body, do what you want. If you want to be a dragon, I will buy you frickin scales. Now hand me the ice cream.""). However, we have talked about this fairly seriously and his one big thing is that he has always seen himself as very heterosexual and very cisgender, never a question in his mind. He says that he will support me no matter what I decide, but it will just take him a little while to wrap his mind around not being in a straight relationship. So I am a bit concerned about straining our marriage. We've done well so far and I really love him, so I don't want to cause him stress. I'm also scared that my transitioning might harm some of his relationships with his conservative family. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, thanks for reading my novel. If you guys have any advice/suggestions/encouragement, I would love to hear it!

For those that aren't the best with other European languages, gender goes a lot deeper than just pronouns (which is most of the language issue in English along with other words that we can mostly get around-sibling instead of brother/sister, spouse instead of husband/wife etc.) and has an effect on nearly any sentence describing someone. For example, if I were to say ""[he is/she is/they are] a good student"" in either language 4 of those words require a gender marker.

Dear [principal],


Hello! My birth name is [birth name], and I'm emailing you just to let you know that I identify as genderqueer, which means I am not a girl or a boy, despite the fact that it says I'm a girl in the the forms that were filled out.


I would greatly prefer if you would refer to me using they/them pronouns and call me [preferred name] instead of [birth name].  It would help me avoid a lot of discomfort.

Only as a label for myself, I do not judge others actions/behaviors/presentation in any gendered way), or if it was me being a rebel ""Why should girls have to shave!?"" or me just being lazy. Scratch that. I know it wasn't just lazy, because it stirs up emotion. 

Anyways, I'm starting aquatherapy tomorrow for my broken leg. And I'm excited! I love water!  But when I put on my suit (trying it tonight to see if it still fits with weight changes) my armpit hair bothered me. Now I don't know if that was a ""girl thing"" or my fear of being mocked, or god knows what. Either way, I shaved them. But now it's like I almost wanna cry. I don't get it. I'm sad that it's gone.

Hey, all. I'm late 30s AFAB and I’ve always been androgynous/more masculine-presenting. I've been out as queer for 20 years, but only recently accepted that I'm NB. It’s been a lifelong journey to get here. Though I'm sure younger folks have plenty to teach me, I’m particularly interested in hearing from any older  (\~35+) NB folks who have discovered/accepted their identity later in life.

&amp;#x200B;

One thing I’m struggling with is whether or not to bother coming out. For me, this involves asking people to use a shortened version of my birth name (90% of people in my life already use the name I like), probably using they/them pronouns (still deciding how I feel about that, I think I like it), and not being called girl, sister, etc. My spouse and some close friends know, and they're great. It's been weird, but OK. I have spent my entire life building a happy queer/liberal bubble around myself, so disclosing my identity doesn’t feel unsafe. I worry a bit about future employment, and I am terrified of telling my elderly parents, but otherwise I feel very little risk. I guess coming out this time around feels less exciting and more like...a hassle?

&amp;#x200B;

On the one hand, disclosing my identity is really cathartic because I have been carrying this baggage around for so long, and it’s nice to know other people might begin to see me the way I see myself. This is a huge internal mental/emotional shift for me, but unless I tell other people about it, they will continue assuming that I identify as a masculine woman and a lesbian. On the other hand, it feels sort of anticlimactic and not worth the trouble, unwanted attention, and potential discomfort/confusion from others. At times I feel like I’m making too big of a deal out of this. But then I realize that “not really worth it/too complicated” was the excuse I used for 20+ years to repress my feelings around gender identity, and that didn’t go so well. I don’t know. I’m not sure I really have a point here. I’m just curious if others have run up against these issues and how they dealt with it.

452,2018-08-31 05:06:43,9bqsqr,3,10,"Hey folks!

I finally got set up with an appointment to see a transgender therapist in a few days.  I've been turning over my memories of thoughts and experiences that led me to believe that I am transgender.

So... I am AMAB, as some of you know.

I always struggled to fit in like a outsider perpetually trapped outside of society.  I seemed as if I was always being castigated by adults for not behaving as I should, and I was shunned by other children for reasons I never could understand.

The earliest experience of gender dysphoria I can recall was that as a child, I longed to wear feminine swimwear.  I can't say why.  It just looked ""comfortable"" for lack of a better word.

Given how I felt constantly judged as inferior and defective, it's no wonder that I never told \*anyone\* of these feelings, but something just occurred to me.

I imagine a scenario where I, as my young child self, am sitting on a beach under the watchful eye of my family.  Suddenly, time freezes, and I am approached by a friendly character, something like an angel or a fairy.  The character looks into my frightened eyes and says, ""I know what you dream of doing on this beach, and you need not be afraid of it anymore, because I have been sent here to grant your most secret desires.  I'm going to take you away to a place where you can experience all of them, and no one here will ever need to know about it.  It will be our special secret because you know what?  I was sent here to love you and care for you the way you are.  All these other people tell you you're not good enough, but I think you're amazing, okay?  You were made this way for a reason, and when you grow up you're going to treat other people kindly, just as I do for you, okay?  You don't need to be afraid anymore.""

And then, she takes me away somewhere, and I become a girl for the duration of this fantasy, and she takes me shopping for swimwear, and I curiously try on everything I can get my hands on, and no one judges that I am foolish, weird, gay, or what have you, and I have a great time, and then she finally takes me back to the beach attired as I desire, and I play in the surf until I am utterly exhausted while my newfound guardian protects me from those jellyfish that I hate so much.

I’m pre everything and in a really rough patch of my life right now.

I’ve known for about two years and came out to my parents last year, but it went awfully. They sent me to conversion therapy, and it was really stressful. I hated it, so I began pretending I’m cis. 

My parents are weird. I love them. I really do, but they’re really controlling. They tell me what to wear and how to look. I had a fever and was going to go to the day and night clinic (walk in doctors office), but my mom stopped me and told me I looked too masculine to go out. One time she drove me and my friends somewhere, and she saw they were dressed feminine and she drove me and my friends back to my house so I could wear something more feminine. It was really embarrassing. They deadname me all the time, near every sentence. 

They get me everything though. A car? Practically new (even though I didn’t ask for one). School tuition? Paid for. Laptop for school? 1400 dollar gaming laptop.  I feel awful because they’re always so great with things like this. I feel like I owe them to be their “cis daughter.”

I attempted suicide a couple times two weeks ago. I frequently self harm because of dysphoria and guilt. How dare I want to be myself when I’ve got a perfectly made life.

I want to go to college, but I can’t afford it on my own, and I don’t know how I’d even begin to pay for any of it. My parents threatened to kick me out for being trans one time and I’m so scared of how I’d survive because I have no job experience and no further education.

Also, how do you feel while you're transitioning? Like phisically and mentally. I think It would be tiring but very rewarding at the end. But I want to hear you.

November is still a ways off, but there's a very important ballot question coming up: [Question 3](https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Question_3%2C_Gender_Identity_Anti-Discrimination_Veto_Referendum_%282018%29).

A **YES** vote will uphold Senate Bill 2407, which prohibits discrimination based on gender identity in public spaces; allowing us to use the correct bathroom, etc.

A **NO** vote will repeal SB 2407 and rip away our protections from discrimination.

Right now, polls are currently showing 48-55% support for the question, with 30-35% against and the remainder undecided. **YOU**, whether you can vote or not, need to get out there and spread the word to your *supportive* family and friends, and ensure they understand the importance of voting **YES** on this question. Feel free to leave the bigots and asshats out of it; let them live in a low-information world and perhaps abstain. We need every YES vote we can get!

Here's a (non-exhaustive) list of places SB 2407 protects us:

· Hotels, inns, and motels;

· Restaurants, bars, and other establishments serving food or drink;

· Theaters, concert halls, sports stadiums, and other places of entertainment;

· Auditoriums, convention centers, lecture halls, and other places of public gathering;

· Sales and rental establishments, including stores, shopping centers, automobile rental agencies, and other retail establishments;

· Service establishments, including laundromats, dry-cleaners, banks, barber shops, travel agents, gas stations, funeral parlors, employment agencies, and providers of professional services such as lawyers, doctors, dentists, accountants, and insurance agents;

· Health care facilities, including dental and medical offices, pharmacies, clinics, hospitals, and nursing homes;

· Transportation services;

· Museums, libraries, galleries, and other places of public display or collection;

· Parks, zoos, amusement parks, and other places of recreation;

· Child care centers, senior citizens centers, homeless shelters, food banks, and other social service establishments;

· Fitness clubs, health spas, bowling alleys, swimming pools, beaches, golf courses, and other places of exercises or recreation.

So this is a long one. I'll try not to be offensive but this has been on my mind for so long now. I really need to get it out. 

I'm currently 25. AMAB. Always been socially awkward, a ""loser"", loner but not by choice. Autsitc. Trouble making friends, even more trouble keeping them. Basically a failure in every sense of the word. [Pretty close to this.](https://imgur.com/skjcfWN)

One thing I notice is that I rarely ever find AFAB like this at all. I've made similar rants in a few other places. Some people claim they have known AFAB ""basement dweller"" types. Any I've know who came close to that- they had an excuse. Sexual assault/abuse as a child or teen. Early pregnancy and the family helps care for the child. AMAB almost never have reasons except social failure and rejection- I'd even call it social abuse, because that's what it is.

A few trans women have replied to my previous rants and said it has to do with how damaging it is being raised male. Of course, any posts pointing this out are sometimes met by cis women being dismissive and saying *""But being women is tougher!!""*. I just hate how it always has to be a competition. It's not. Can't we just post about how damaged we are from forced maleness onto us, without anyone trying to shoot down our traumatic experiences?

I've had dysphoria since I was a young child, in one way or another, but the thing is- I never had physical dysphoria badly. The thought of things like menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth were just scary to me, especially since I'm very squeamish (and yes I know not all cis women do those things). Occasionally I did have desires for breasts and a vagina, but I don't know if it was just to ""fit"" my social dysphoria. 

My most prominent dysphoria is social. I just feel like my life would be so much better if people saw me as a woman. The few times I lived near any trans groups and was able to present and be referred to as she/her, it just felt way better.

 As a socially awkward male-presenting AMAB, especially one who isn't overly masculine and doesn't feel the need to present as such, I get seen as creepy, awkward, possibly a pedo or sex offender, and I'm none of that. I'm not seen as someone to be social with. 

I understand why. I understand that many people have been hurt by cis men (self included). I understand it's perfectly reasonable to have that fear there. 

But the biggest pain is that other AMAB see me that way too. You'd think there'd be some empathy there? No, of course not. Cis men, especially straight ones, want zero fuck all to do with me. Most of the few ""friends"" I had stopped being such when I came out, or even before then for other really petty reasons.

It really irks me when cis men talk about women ""being catty"" and always fighting with each other... yeah right! Way to show off your own insecurities, *bro*. As if every male friend I had didn't leave me in the dust for the most petty reason imaginable. 

I'm not gonna say that trans/masc AFAB don't have it difficult too. I don't know what it's like. But whenever I meet people like myself (on the internet, usually), they're always AMAB. 

I have to wonder if being AFAB makes things easier to socialize and keep lasting interpersonal relationships. I'll never know. I just know that whatever I am, is not seen as someone worth any of that stuff. 

And I know for a fact that it's the way males treat each other. I'm not saying that women just sit around hugging each other. But everything from a male is always telling me to toughen up, always trying to bully me. If it is nice, it's because he sees me as a sexual object. 

Even the *supposed* advantages of being AMAB... like physical strength? I never had that! I took co-ed gym classes most of my life... I was easily one of the worst performing students, if not the worst. Would being AFAB had made it easier on me? I don't know, because even as AMAB, I could not reach what the fitness test minimum for AFAB were anyway. But, as insulting as this is, the lowered expectations would have benefited me a ton. 

When a cis woman gets applauded for lifting something heavy, meanwhile I'm expected to lift double and if I can't, I get downright humiliated and verbally abused. Any job I get (the minimum wage slave labor willing to hire me), I have all these physical expectations hurled at me. Any complaints I make about this get met with a victim-blaming *""Go to the gym, bro!""*.

Not even just that- men say that I'm supposed to be ""more emotionally stable"" than a woman? Yeah right. I'm bipolar and I'm a mess. They can go on about the supposed advantages of being AMAB- I got absolutely none of em. I feel like a failure.

The AFAB I talk to- cis women, trans men, non-binary, gender queer, all others- seem very well adjusted in life, or at least, way more than me. They have their group of stable friends, and have for a while. Most don't have trouble getting dates if they desire. Most have an actual career, or are working on getting one. They have a light at the end of the tunnel- a life set up to promise things may end up okay.

I could never even dream of that. I'll likely never have any of that. I think I'm just too damaged at this point.

If it is nice, it\'s because he sees me as a sexual object. \n\nEven the *supposed* advantages of being AMAB... like physical strength? I never had that! I took co-ed gym classes most of my life... I was easily one of the worst performing students, if not the worst. Would being AFAB had made it easier on me? I don\'t know, because even as AMAB, I could not reach what the fitness test minimum for AFAB were anyway. But, as insulting as this is, the lowered expectations would have benefited me a ton. \n\nWhen a cis woman gets applauded for lifting something heavy, meanwhile I\'m expected to lift double and if I can\'t, I get downright humiliated and verbally abused. Any job I get (the minimum wage slave labor willing to hire me), I have all these physical expectations hurled at me. Any complaints I make about this get met with a victim-blaming *""Go to the gym, bro!""*.\n\nNot even just that- men say that I\'m supposed to be ""more emotionally stable"" than a woman? Yeah right. I\'m bipolar and I\'m a mess. They can go on about the supposed advantages of being AMAB- I got absolutely none of em. I feel like a failure.\n\nThe AFAB I talk to- cis women, trans men, non-binary, gender queer, all others- seem very well adjusted in life, or at least, way more than me. They have their group of stable friends, and have for a while. Most don\'t have trouble getting dates if they desire. Most have an actual career, or are working on getting one. They have a light at the end of the tunnel- a life set up to promise things may end up okay.\n\nI could never even dream of that. I\'ll likely never have any of that. I think I\'m just too damaged at this point. ', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': ""Just really wish I could've been AFAB- it seems better socially"", 'created': 1533525055.0}"

I am working on a blog entry about what trans people encounter when they come out to others who are very religious and am looking for any experiences or impacts you are willing to share (whether positive or negative)...or, if you're stealth around religious folk, what experiences have led up to that decision being your safer option.

No names or references to this subreddit will be mentioned, of course, but I'm interested in hearing your stories, even if it's just a couple lines. 

I'm in a weird position as I am a church leader who is trans, and have decided to start writing ""to"" the Church and explaining what it's like to live this out as a human being behind the religious stereotypes and condemnation. This specific entry is focused on how Christians often respond versus how they could be choosing to respond instead.

80,2018-08-07 20:07:33,95f3so,5,9,"TL;DR: I'm questioning everything right now and am trying to sort through the chaos in my brain.

I (25) have identified as a man for my whole life and gay since I was 19. I've always been more on the stereotypically feminine side. I've always preferred female friends over male ones, and I've always had a deep appreciation for things that, traditionally, are meant for women. I've dressed in women's clothing, and while I wouldn't have admitted it then (it was supposedly a joke), I really enjoyed it. Despite all that, I've always been a man.

That said, I've also hated my body for as long as I remember. I'm naturally pretty hairy, and I was always heavier. I chalked up my dislike to that. However, over the last couple of years, I've lost a lot of weight, and I started removing my body hair, and while that helped, it made me think even more and more about my body. I want to be pretty. I want to wear dresses and have curves. Today, I decided I wanted to look at dresses on Amazon, and I almost cried because I want one so badly, but I'm scared to admit it to anyone. I asked my boyfriend (who is bi) in passing whether he would be ok dating a trans person, and he said he would, but at the same time, he was a bit uncomfortable a while back when we started talking about the idea of crossdressing. Or at least it seemed that way. That scares me. I'm sure if it came down to it, he would accept me , but I'm not sure what it would mean for our relationship.

On top of all that, I do like my penis. It's not something that grosses me out or something that I don't feel is part of me. That makes me question whether it's really that I'm trans or if I'm just genderfluid. To be honest, this isn't the first time I've questioned my gender identity. Less than a year after coming out as gay, I mentioned in passing to a close female friend of mine – let's call her Elise – that sometimes I feel more comfortable with the idea of femininity. The conversation went something like this:

&gt;Me: You know, sometimes I'm jealous of women. I want to look like that. Is that weird?  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: What? Are you saying you're trans?  
&gt;  
&gt;Me: ... I don't know...  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: \*panicking slightly\* What?... You're not serious.  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: ...  
&gt;  
&gt;Elise: I can't deal with this right now.

I can't even begin to tell you how much that hurt. I worry about what others might think if I decided to transition. Where I live, it's bad enough being gay. i mean, it's not terrible here, but the amount of judgement and disapproving stares I get already is more than enough. On top of that, a trans man was beaten to death two years ago in my state's most progressive city.

There are so many things going through my mind right now, and I'm not sure how to process them. thank you, r/trans, for listening to/reading the chaos that's erupting from my brain. I'd greatly appreciate any resources you might be able to share. Let me know your thoughts.

I worry about what others might think if I decided to transition. Where I live, it's bad enough being gay. i mean, it's not terrible here, but the amount of judgement and disapproving stares I get already is more than enough. On top of that, a trans man was beaten to death two years ago in my state's most progressive city.\n\nThere are so many things going through my mind right now, and I'm not sure how to process them. thank you, r/trans, for listening to/reading the chaos that's erupting from my brain.

Is it normal for men (cis or post-op trans, in particular) to...

- Have more difficulty controlling bowel movements than women?
- Have scrotum chafing from briefs/any underwear not loose enough that it isn't touching?
- Have a scrotum positioned so it's between the thighs making walking difficult/painful?
- Have a scrotum that crowds the penis nearly 360 but especially underside base?
- Find that, in general, getting an erection hurts?
- Have to urinate in a cup, due to insufficient length and angle of penis?
- Have insecurity about shape of meatus?

Like I know I've always been different, liked and got along better with girls my entire life/hated trying to get along with the majority of guys, but that just seemed like me. But I've never felt right about myself

I've thought about it for a while, sometimes it sounds like the thing I'm missing while other times I just reject it. I'll probably bring it up with a psychologist or something, but even if I did I don't think transitioning would ever be an option. If it were I'd wait for a while, at least till I finish college (got two more semesters!)

Idk if I should even be posting this here or if anyone can relate. I feel bad for having the dysphoria now since I didn't as a child, even if I was always a bit different. But I guess people change and events (or drugs) can change people.

But I've never felt right about myself\n\nI've thought about it for a while, sometimes it sounds like the thing I'm missing while other times I just reject it. I'll probably bring it up with a psychologist or something, but even if I did I don't think transitioning would ever be an option. If it were I'd wait for a while, at least till I finish college (got two more semesters!)\n\nIdk if I should even be posting this here or if anyone can relate. I feel bad for having the dysphoria now since I didn't as a child, even if I was always a bit different.

I don't really what to say and I'm sorry if I say things the wrong way or vaguely I just to vent.

I'm very unsure of myself at the moment I'm(or thought anyways) a cis man but as a child I always wished I was a woman and would dress up when I was alone, I always felt so ashamed of myself afterwards and pushed it away for year despite how in the moment i'd be so happy. I stopped when I was 13 telling myself it was wrong and I should be ashamed of it.

I never fully stopped these thoughts but kept them out enough until about 2 years ago (I'm 21 now) I feel more conflicted then I ever did, not all day every day but I still get strong feelings of what I wish to be and still feel the shame of it. I find myself jealous of women because of how they look and how wish I could be them. I do my girlfriends makeup sometimes and enjoy it alot and she seems to think I'm good at it and love picking out clothes for her when she asks and buying her birthday present but I find myself wishing they were mine. I recently had a week in which no one was in my house and spent it dressed as women and I loved it but still felt overwhelmed with guilt and shame all the same.

I feel so conflicted and I don't know if these are valid reasons to question myself or if it means something.

119,2018-08-13 04:26:41,96vcix,6,3,"I apologize in advance, this may turn into a lengthy post. I will try to be concise.

I’m AMAB. Growing up I’ve been told I’m a boy and how to act like one. That never necessarily bothered me. However, there have been some things on rare occasions which I look back on and think that I may have not been paying attention to the subtleties. My mother told me that when I was very young, I had said to her once that I’m a girl and I’m going to wear makeup. Now idk if that meant anything. My mom said I was laughing and she said I told her that in a joking manner. Another time (early teens) I remember thinking “I wonder what it would be like to be a girl”. I actually said it out loud and my mom looked at me with strange eyes and said “that’s weird”. At the time, it was just a passing thought and that’s what I had told her.

I’ve put on nail polish before because I thought it would be fun (early teens). It was clear nail polish and my mom had put it on for me and for my brother. I only did it once because I thought to myself “boys shouldn’t like this I can’t do that again” or something to that affect. Sometimes when I’ve jerked off about having sex with girls, I’d imagine myself in there position.

I don’t have a problem with my dick, I like it very much. But I have thought about what it would feel like to have a vagina. I’ve thought about how it would be nice if I could have both, though I know that isn’t realistic (hot-swappable genitals sounds great tbh). I don’t necessarily have a problem with my body as it is, but I noticed that I don’t really like body hair all that much. I started shaving/trimming/grooming my chest (late high school) and (once again mentioning her) my mom saw and asked if I was gay (I’m bi but I didn’t find that out till later on).

I’ve only recently started questioning my gender (I’m in my early 20s). Idk how dysphoria should affect me and how it should feel. I’ve thought about it a good bit and think I’m genderqueer. I’m not opposed to my assigned gender completely, but I definitely don’t fit in it 100%. I’ve thought about having a more feminine body. I like the idea of having curves and boobs. I like the idea of wearing feminine clothing. I’ve never really cross dressed, but it’s something I want to try. I’ve worn female underwear before and it felt good. I’ve tried to wear some of my gfs clothes, but I can’t fit into them properly without fear of tearing them. I was in a musical once as an extra and had to wear makeup. It wasn’t that bad, but it did feel weird a little since it was my first time. That being said, I’d probably prefer more of an androgynous look with a more feminine undertone? Not by much tho.

It’s pretty late as I’m writing this. I may have missed another example or two, so I hope this is enough to go on for you all who read this. I really appreciate anyone who takes time to read this and reply. This is something that I’m having trouble with lately, and idk who to talk to about it.

131,2018-08-14 12:33:44,977ymk,0,7,"I really need to vent a bit because this is really upsetting me, so thanks for bearing with me. A bit of context, my mother is disabled and is quickly heading to a future where she won’t be able to live on her own or care for herself adequately. She’s been in the hospital for the last few days and a social worker had been assigned to her and has been in frequent contact with my family about my mom. 

I have not had any direct interaction with this social worker, nor do I anticipate having any interaction with them because I live a very long ways away from where my mother lives and her sisters and brother are the main decision makers in this situation. 

My aunts have been forwarding all of the emails that have been sent between them and this social worker in order to keep me in the loop, which I really appreciate but in one email I was listed as one my mother’s family contacts under my dead name and listed as her daughter.

I legally changed my name and came out to my family years ago as male and have on multiple occasions interacted with my family and have been referred to as my legal name. My mother also knows about my name change and that I’m trans and despite suffering from the steady degeneration of her mental capacity she still manages to not purposefully misgender me and actually corrects herself when she slips up! 

I don’t really think there’s much I can do in this situation unfortunately. I’m certainly debating emailing the family member and telling them that they deliberately misinformed a professional about one of their clients family/emergency contacts but I don’t want to make the situation about me when my mom is really the person who needs my help and attention. I’ve also considered just contacting the social worker myself and giving her the correct information and making it just seem like a little typo on my family’s behalf. Making vague, passive-aggressive Facebook statuses are also very tempting right now.

Now if I begin to like someone, it not too long before I just want to fall over on them and beg them to just hold me, pet me and tell me I'm pretty. Cuddling is like the best. If they aren't feeling it, I litterally have to get away from them because wanting their attention and affection so badly for long periods of time can be sorta painful.

You end up depressed because you can't focus on doing anything you love, you're so wrapped up in who you're trying to be and what you're trying to achieve that you can forget to just be you and do the things you love.

Ya'll need that reset so you can get back to facing life with a fresh, clear mind that's not exhausted. 

A lot of you might be like, **""How do I just stop thinking about it?""** and for you, meditation is gonna be your best friend.

I suggest downloading Headspace and using the 10 day free trial as a starter course on how to meditate. From here you can either continue on doing mindful meditation on your own, pay for the full app, or use Youtube to find other guided meditations.

Meditation will teach you to control your mind, but not just while meditating, but also throughout your day. This is integral in being able to take a mental break, otherwise you can try all the distractions you like, music, TV, video games, your mind will still find a way to get back to what's nagging it if you don't learn to silence it.

If you can already shut down negative thoughts, that's great, you need to exercise that control.

Try giving yourself assigned break days. Like maybe tuesdays and thursdays are days for you to just get away from the worries, and focus on your current day instead of what's ahead. 

- Put on some of your favorite feel-good music and blast it on the way to work. 

- Stay away from trans reddit, blog posts etc. and just focus on you. 

- Avoid mirrors or anything that could trigger dysphoria or thoughts about your image, and ignore thoughts about your appearance, let them pass.

I would see a woman or a dress, realize that what I thought was admiration was really more envy then, hem and haw until I reached a conclusion.   


That conclusion being that I desperately wanted to present as femme. However this conclusion would \*excite\* me and after a victory lap I'd realize most dysphoria and all enthusiasm had vanished.

2: This dysphoria feels real.

This scares me because I've been thinking thoughts like this for years. I remember even telling myself I wanted to reincarnate as a woman, and that I might ""be happier like that"".   


3: I thought I had a 3rd one but I guess that's it. I guess if I had to say something it'd be that I know I'll lose a lot of family and sort of friendships. I'm a pastor's child in the bible belt. I'm kind of scarred about the answer, but I want to live honestly.

What's the difference between me and rain storm?? A rain storm will eventually pass.

 So I know this title may suggest I'm here trolling but I want to have a genuine conversation about passing and about the ways trans people can be shitty to each other. I personally pass like maybe 2 days out of the year. (No I don't look like a man, I just look transgender) I don't really mind it either. People are still nice to me. People still find me attractive. I still have some dysphoria about parts of my body, but that's my thing.

 If you are someone who values passing a lot and wants to attain that, that's fine and I'm rooting for you. I used to pass quite frequently. I would spend 2 hours on my hair and makeup everyday. I practiced my voice everyday. It got to the point that I could talk face to face with cis people who I knew in highschool and they'd have no idea I was trans or that they knew me from somewhere. This was before I started hormones. I just got sick of it after a while. I just wanted to relax. I was tired of working so hard just to get people's respect and feel like I was ""doing it the right way"". I kinda threw out the rule book around 8 months on Hormones.

If you too have drug the gutters online and you may have found the term HON. This is a nasty word that trans-feminine people will call each other when they aren't passing. It comes from the saying, "" You look great Hon."" used in a disingenuous way, mocking the ""everyone is beautiful"" ideology. To a degree, yes I would like people to be honest with me about how I look but I also want them to not have a head that's full of garbage.

 According to the formula for what make you a hon, I'm all of that. I have a big forehead, wide shoulders, big feet, I'm 6'1"" and I have a deep voice. Do some of these things give me dysphoria? Yes. Does that mean my transition is hopeless and that I'm wasting my time? Hell No! I'm 2 1/2 years on hormones and this is the happiest my life has been. I get treated well in public even when people clock me. On the rare occasion that someone is shitty toward me, that's not a failure on my part, that's just that person's weird  transphobic bullshit. Most people look at me a little curious but then they give me this big warm smile. Cis het men will still tell me I'm beautiful in public. What I'm saying is that I think passing is cool and all, but it doesn't make you any better or that much better off in life. You can be completely non passing and also very beautiful.

Until tonight.

I've been watching ""Altered Carbon"" on Netflix.  If you have strong/severe dysphoria I'd suggest you don't watch the show.

A major part of the show (explained in the first episode, so I'm not spoiling anything) is that a person's consciousness can be put into another body.  I've been binge watching all day, at work and at home.  And I got to the fifth episode or so and a panic attack-like feeling hit me.  My heart started racing, I couldn't think straight, everything seemed to go in slow motion for a minute, I felt like I had forgotten to breathe, and I got a feeling like a shot to the gut.

I think what set it off was the very very brief moment of obviously unfounded daydream/hope that something like that would be possible - that I could just get a new female body with all the right working parts and just have the outside match the inside instantly.

It was literally less than a second after that thought first formed in my brain that I almost started crying. I can't really explain the feeling properly.  It's like my brain went into overload or meltdown or something, and I just felt really uncomfortable and sad about having male genitalia, and having a masculine body.

234,2018-08-24 04:52:33,99uki8,0,1,"Hey there, I identify as non binary and am running into some annoyance re wedding attire. Mostly looking to vent, advice also appreciated.

My sister is getting married and my mom is doing the wedding planning/financing. I am a “bridesmaid” and my sister told me I could wear what I want as long as it’s black and dressy.

I recently came out to my parents. We have yet to have a serious talk about it but they seem supportive. But there is a sticking point on wedding attire.

My mom supports me not wearing a dress. In fact she approached me about wearing a custom made suit! However she is only really willing to have me get a suit from a bridal shop that basically only makes dresses. They are very high end and do custom work, but the custom work they do is... dresses. The style of design is also based on a magazine clipping, it’s not very feminine but it’s not what I look for in a suit either, even though it’s pretty on the model. I do get dysphoric and unhappy with women’s clothing.

I am so confused about why my mom isn’t more open to me getting a suit made by a suit shop. She keeps claiming it will be too expensive or not nice enough, and saying that if I don’t want the suit from the dress shop I can always go find a tux at a tux rental place.

Mostly looking to vent, advice also appreciated.\n\nMy sister is getting married and my mom is doing the wedding planning/financing. I am a “bridesmaid” and my sister told me I could wear what I want as long as it’s black and dressy.\n\nI recently came out to my parents. We have yet to have a serious talk about it but they seem supportive. But there is a sticking point on wedding attire.\n\nMy mom supports me not wearing a dress. In fact she approached me about wearing a custom made suit! However she is only really willing to have me get a suit from a bridal shop that basically only makes dresses. They are very high end and do custom work, but the custom work they do is... dresses. The style of design is also based on a magazine clipping, it’s not very feminine but it’s not what I look for in a suit either, even though it’s pretty on the model. I do get dysphoric and unhappy with women’s clothing.\n\nI am so confused about why my mom isn’t more open to me getting a suit made by a suit shop. She keeps claiming it will be too expensive or not nice enough, and saying that if I don’t want the suit from the dress shop I can always go find a tux at a tux rental place.

For a little backstory, it's been about 2 years since I've last spoken to her, and I have a wonderful cis partner who loves me very much. My partner knows exactly what I was doing, and she's OK with the fact that I reached out in the first place. 

My ex and I ended on a really sour note because neither of us really handled my coming out all that well. By that I mean it was an utter shit show.

When my ex and i had first started dating her mother had accused me of being a trans man (I was presenting as Male, which is how I was assigned at birth). I said I wasn't  a trans man, which is in fact the truth. What I didn't tell them was that I had been having gender dysphoria for years at that point. I mean, seriously, it was like 2 weeks into us dating at most, probably less than that. I felt no obligation to come out at that point in time.

Well, after I came out I was accused of lying. Her family called me all kinds of names. Even now she holds to the idea that I lied about who and what I am. She called me toxic for keeping that information to myself, even though she knows I was not in a position to come out at home at the time that we started dating. She blames me for everything that went wrong and hates me for it.

Now, I'm not wanting her back in my life. The messages between us really showed me that she and I will never be friends. I guess I just want validation that it was Ok for me to not have come out to her when I wasn't ready to come out to anyone during our first 2 weeks of dating. I want to know that I wasn't this horrible monster for coming out when I was comfortable and safe.

Typing that out makes it feel like it should be obvious but... you know. It's still hard after hearing how shitty I am for it and being called a liar.

I know it was a stupid fear, because I know he loves me and would accept me however I am, but there are a lot of memories from my childhood that have entrained fear in me. He had a temper and would often call me names that internalized homophobia in me as I had to conform myself to fit in the box I thought being a son was.

It was an amazing experience. I had wanted to do this for a while now, and have thought out crazy scenarios to do it. It happened kinda by chance. I was making a late dinner to use up the mish mash of leftover ingredients and wound up making way too much. I offered him some and we ate together in the living room. We started chatting and I felt it coming. Tears welled up in my eyes and started streaming down my face. He asked what was wrong and I told him after a moment’s hesitation. 

He let me know that he didn’t care what I did or how I choose to live my life, he just wanted me to be happy. I am happy. I’m so grateful to have as wonderful of a father as I do.

We continued talking about a wide variety of topics. The past, the future, aliens, pretty much everything. Most of the conversation was him rambling, as he is oft to do, but I enjoy listen to how his mind works.

The night ended with a hug and he told me that was one of the best nights he ever had. It was for me too. For most of my life it has felt like we could have been in the same room but still be miles apart. I feel like that gap has been bridged in just a few hours. I love him. I love myself.

The problem is that the last time I can have gender dysphoria, I explain, I am 21 years old but three years ago I have a girl and I play with them, I used to ask my sister dresses but my mother would not let me, I did not like to have penis. I kept growing and always wanted to have a girl's body, even though I never said anything influenced by my family environment that was not very receptive. I have had stages in which that feeling was not so strong but did not disappear. When a transsexual person came out on TV he wants to become free and be able to change his gene. In the stage of puberty until now when I looked at the girl I would not like to be attractive, that I would envy her body, her curves, her breasts and I think about what I would love to have. I do not consider myself homosexual either.
I'm definitely thinking about this topic a lot and I'm confused about everything. Believe that I should do something, ask myself who I am and try to throw myself out of this body and be really happy. I am scared of my family environment, they are quite conservative, although as a child I took a picture that told me it was me but I did not have it because of the comments they say towards transgender people.

You were tasteful and looked great in a dress. For a while, I did not hate you. But you are a hindrance to my endeavors, I am uncomfortable around you. I cannot be there to support you on a daily basis when you keep getting us pulled out of bathrooms and prevent me from wearing shirts that fit. So you must leave. I wish you the best in your future bio-hazardous waste disposal bag.

TLC's Lost in Transition wants to help those of you fighting to find the courage to come out. I've had a few conversations with some key people regarding Season One, and their plans for Season Two.

Hi folks -

​

I am an Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southern Mississippi whose research focuses on suicide prevention. Some colleagues and I are looking to collect some preliminary data to help us understand in what ways risk is similar (and different) across a range of diverse populations with elevated suicide rates. Some of these groups overlap with one another quite a bit (e.g. gun owners, law enforcement, active duty military) and some are quite different (e.g. veterinarians, first time new mothers). Our goal is to recruit enough folks to consider groups in isolation or in comparison to one another so that we can understand better how risk shifts in nature from one group to another (and within broader groups that have substantial diversity within them).

​

One group that has been getting very little attention and whose perspective has been underrepresented in suicide research is the transgender community and I am hoping that individuals who identify as transgender may be willing to take part in this anonymous survey. If you do, some of the items you answer will be ones asked of everyone and some will be unique to the group you indicate that you most identify with. Some of the items are repetitive (sorry...that's an unfortunate reality of scientific research), but we did out best to make the survey both comprehensive and short.

​

Keep in mind that, although this post is specifically seeking individuals who identify as transgender, we would be thrilled to have anyone take part. Eligibility simply depends upon whether you currently identify with one of the specific groups we are considering in this particular study.

​

I myself am not an expert on the perspective of the transgender community, but my colleague at Louisiana State University is and he developed this section of the survey. That being said, I would be more than happy to receive and pass along feedback ([michael.anestis@usm.edu](mailto:michael.anestis@usm.edu)) and hope that we are able to contribute something of value through our efforts.

​

The survey has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of USM. If you are interested in taking part, here is the link.

So I took my 15 yo transgender step brother to the barbers down the road where I always get my hair cut which I was surprised at because like him I had/have anxiety when I was that age and refused to even get my hair cut, so it was quite a big deal regardless of gender identity. 
So anyway the ride over there he got cold feet and didn’t want to go in but I somehow convinced him having not even considered unlikely scenario that was about to happen.
 
The female barber of course addresses him as a her which isn’t a big deal as he’s used to it. (Or we expected it to happed) and said “we don’t cut girls hair.”
I replied with “she just wants a boys cut”
She followed by the same “but we don’t do girls hair”

Me being me I cut to the chase and took the barber aside and said she’s  transgender, just treat her like a boy and give her a boy haircut...okay?

She then had to fetch the other barber/owner to see if he would cut his hair. 
You can see where this is going.
He refused.
I said “that’s discrimination”
The female barber said “yeh sorry”

Okay so, a few months back I went through a shortish spell of hectically questioning my gender, and then that kind of went away. Fast forward a month or so, and my partner figured out she's trans. This caused an avalanche of research on gender for both of us, and I am back at the questioning stage.

Here's the deal: I'm afab, totally happy with feminine pronouns. I generally don't experience dysphoria, but sometimes my breasts annoy me and I would rather they were gone. I also hate my uterus, but that's mostly unrelated (I think?). I definitely don't want to be a man. At all. Ever. But I do think having a penis would be much better than having a vagina.

My partner has pointed out that I've never been femme, which doesn't say anything in itself, but it did make me realise some things. Jokes referring to me being the man in the relationship and the like have never bothered me, and according to some things I've read, that would bother the average cis woman? As a kid, my friends would always make me play The Boy in whatever game we were playing or story we were making up, and that was fine. Later on, I started choosing that role for myself, because I enjoyed it. And that was weird to some people.

Or buying things for my partner with the fantasy in my head that I'm a man in the 1950s spoiling his woman. Even before my partner came out as trans.

I don't want to present as a man, but I don't feel 100% like a woman either.

I'm into goth/punk styles, so that at least helps with the androgyny a little bit, but I'm very tall and skinny so a lot of clothing, esp mens, doesn't fit me very well.

8,2018-08-01 23:54:16,93ud9w,16,6,"Hi!, so I wanted to ask about a topic that I really don't undestand about being a transgender person, but because I'm trans too but I think I have a very weird and different experience, and maybe I'm not even trans, I don't really know.

Well, first of all, I'm non-binary and agender. I think that gender it's a social construct, but that doesn't mean that gender doesn't exist (I'm just really neutral about it in my case), instead, I think that gender and sex doesn't have anything in common at all: your body doesn't dictate your gender identity, your body it's not just a man or a woman body, it's yours, and if you are a man/woman/nonbinary/genderqueer, it's a man/woman/nonbinary/genderqueer's body, that's it (I'm saying about gender, not sex).

So I have two questions:

1. I think that a lot of people think like me, that you are not less of your gender for having your body. But I don't understand something, and it's that, even if they say that gender and sex doesn't have to be linked, why do most of the trans community want to change their body and why they have body dysphoria in the first place? I understand social dysphoria because it's horrible when people misgenders you and don't treat you as how you want to be percieved, but... if you are a man or a woman because you feel like it and not because of your parts, why do we have to try to get another type or body to feel validated? It's like a contradiction.
Is is because cis people, that are relly ignorant, doesn't validate your gender because of your body and you have to change it? Or because you don't really like it in the first place, 
(independently  about what cis people see you as)?

(I want to say that I asked this question to some other people and told me that they really don't like their body because of their sex, not because society makes them believe that you 	have to have a female sex to be a woman or a male sex to be a man, etc. So, what I want to say it's that it's more about medical transition about someone's sex?, I think. Not just 	socially. Sorry if I'm not good at explaining it, just tell me if I'm saying things wrong) 

What I'm trying to say it's that a lot of people think that they have to ¨pass¨ as a woman or a man, but isn't that cissexist or sexist? You are a woman or a man if you feel like it, you don't become a woman or a man. So, if I'm really wrong, tell me.


2. Something that I really noticed it's that, if someone is transwoman, for example, they tend to be really femenine and wear very femenine clothes all the time, and viceversa. (Or if someone is nonbinary, they have to be androgynous).

So... In my case, I wear whatever I want, without thinking about something is femenine or masculine. I don't really care. And I'm not saying that you can't be stereotipically femenine or masuline, or androgynous. What I'm trying to say it's that sometimes I feel that I'm a fake agender or a fake trans because of this, that I don't care about the gender roles of my identity (In my case, being androgynous), and that I have to be like super stereotipical because I'm faking it. And I'm sure some people doesn't care either whatever they wear.

And it's interesting because cis people tend to care less about gender roles (I know there is a 	lot of sexism in the world, but I think there is less). They are a lot of femenine cis guys and 	masculine cis gals. So, can trans people ignore gender roles too? Or are we less trans? And what makes you woman or man, because of being femenine or masculine? Or about the concept and feeling of being that group in society, for example? I think that's really interesting, and I wanted to know about your opinions. And sorry if there's something rude that I said, and I don't mean to say that you should obey me about what you have to do with your lives, or anything like that, obviously. People should just do whatever they want to. But yeah, thank you for reading.

Am I special in just always having been me without feeling the need to slap a gazillion labels on myself?
So I read some explanations from genderfluid / genderqueer people and what I encountered most of the time was a variation of ""sometimes I like to act feminine and like girl things and other times I prefer manly stuff and act more masculine"". While I get feeling actual dysphoria from thinking of yourself as ""a guy"" or ""a girl"", I don't see the need to label myself gender queer just because I exhibit traits or preferences that are perceived as typically male or female, because those are just terms society uses to describe stuff and that stuff varies from society to society at that. As gender for me is a narrow category I don't need see the need to fit into, I don't feel a need to use something else than what is already there and instead just expand the category.
I think that I myself would qualify as gender queer, but I never felt the need to search beyond ""girl / woman with unfortunately not very female body nor face and mostly at home with more typically masculine stuff, interests and friends"". That's just who I am - my face is so androgynous that most people mistake me for a man when I'm not wearing makeup, my body kind of got stuck halfways (primary genitalia and rather slight general build definitely female, everything else debatable) and most of my life I got along much better with typical men, meaning in terms of communication type and interests. I can't stand some behavior typically seen as female. Most of my friends are male because I just can't connect to most women as easily. I wore loose, baggy clothes well into my late teens, mostly because I was overweight. I never put on makeup because I thought that looks shouldn't be that important. Yet I hate the fact that I'm not pretty and typically female-looking and that people mistake me for a man, I love wearing feminine stuff that accentuates the feminine traits I do have now, I'm very emotional, I'm very communicative and sociable, I love that my boyfriend is a little bit taller and a lot stronger than me, I love singing and a lot more and people that not just judge by my face would definitely identify me as female.

I never cared about how women should behave and what was expected of a female, I always did my own thing and was just me. When I wanted to hit on someone I met, I just did and saw how they reacted.
Is it just that I have never put any weight on predefined terms and that my personal circumstances have been so that I always was my own category in every conceivable way or am I genderqueer or agender or whatever and don't know it?
How do you define ""feeling male"" and ""feeling female"" when for me, I just do what the heck I want without bothering if it is masculinely or femininely attributed? Is it easier for a woman because, at least in my culture, accepted-ish behavior for females is still a much broader spectrum than that for males?

This whole thing ended my last relationship. There were days when I just wasn't attracted to her.

I have so much trouble making forward progress in anything as a result, especially making friends/fostering any sort of relationship, platonic or not.

I'm a 31 year old AFAB, and other than always being slightly more tomboy I never really has any reasons to believe I'm anything other than a cis woman.

About a year ago, I had my first bout of dysphoria. I was a man. I knew it, felt it, wanted nothing more than to have a Male body and present Male. During this time I started using Male pronouns and a male name but only online. My real life had no clue. But after only a few weeks that faded. I was a woman. And comfortable. This past January, I had this extreme change, I was a guy and I need to transition. I came out to my husband who thankfully was completely supportive and said he'd be there with me through whatever I needed. This time it lasted about 2 months. But then, I literally woke up one morning and was a woman again. No feelings of being a guy whatsoever. Ever since I tend to go about a month between changes. I'm either fully guy, or fully girl. Currently I'm a girl. I have no dysphoria whatsoever and I'm mostly happy with who I am and my body. But when I'm a guy, I'm ready to transition. I need a beard, a flat chest, a deeper voice, something else downstairs. I am working on just dealing with my swings and not socially coming out. I dress more androgynously when I'm a guy, and more feminine when I'm a girl, and when at home i go the extra mile and pack and bind. But I'm not sure socially coming out as genderfluid is something that I should or could do. I'm married, I have kids, neither my husbands or my family would understand or try to understand. Thoughts? Ideas?

I came to terms that I was queer about a year ago, but I didn't know a dam thing about the LGBTQ community so I started doing research. As I went I found terms for thing I didn't know beforehand, (Sidenote, I know that these are just generalizations of the spectrum of identity that is out there)

First I came out to my close friend that I was pan, I chose her because she and I were dating at the time and are still generally close friends, (also she's Bi, that might be part of it)

But I wasn't very happy with that decision and was just ending up looking at this and some other subreddits about this stuff.
I ended up staring at one word a lot, Gender Fluid, the first instance that I saw the term was in a book one of my queer friends lent me, (more forced me to read it, but never mind) the books title was 'The Symptoms of Being Human' and it was a very good read.

One term that was used in the book was and I quote as best I can,
""Its less like a switch and more like a knob, it can go up or down and anywhere in between."" That quote really summed up what I was feeling at the time so I started to identify as gender fluid.

Now fast forward to three month ago, when school was almost over for the summer and my 'gender knob' so to speak so stuck on full girl mode and stayed that way until three days ago when I was identify as female. But lately I've been feeling more fluid and between, I'm also feeling very confused. None of my friend ever respond to me so I thought I would try this subreddit.

48,2018-08-11 23:00:07,96ko3u,11,44,"Hi! Sorry, i’m probably going to rant for a bit. 
First of all, I’m Felix, i’m AMAB, kinda non-binary, and right now, I’m very sad.

I just finished my last day at my job, a job that I loved sooo much, partly because it was such a feminine environment (serving food to people!) and becaue i could wear a cute aprin all day. Oh, and great collegues too! I reqlly had some great times with them, and particularly one girl i was working with. 

First time I saw her, I knew she was going to break my heart! After a couple weeks working together, we developped a great friendship and I was just constantly amazed at how good and funny of a person she is! 

Today, we were talking and she said that she kept talking about me to her bf and he got jealous. She laughted and proceded to tell me how she told him we would certainly never date. I diverted the conversation on her bf’s jealousy and she said it wasn’t that bad, and even if I wasn’t gay he would not care that much. 

The thing is, i never told her I was gay... and she is not the first to just assume I can’t  possibly be anything else! I don’t blame her, but it really annoyed me. 

It’s more than that, everytime I’ve liked someone, its the same story repeating itself over and over and over again. Every single time, it leads to a similar conversation: from the “help me to find a bra for this guy i’m going on a date with tonight” to the “you’re like a sister to me”, it always hurt so much. 

And inevitably, after it happens I think about what I should have done or said, how I could “man up” if I would like to know what the fuss is all about with requited love sometimes before I turn 50 (i’m 23 now). But everytime I try I fail miserably, because that is not me, I’m not a man, i’m not that guy that will make someone feel safe, I can’t look at a person like a piece of meat and I can’t be direct about my feelings... 

It’s hard not to lose hope, to still believe one day there will be a miracle. For a moment, I thought she was that miracle, she didnt seem to care I wasnt very manly, she likes girls too anyways, so why not me? 

I knew it would not happen, but that very tiny bit of hope made me feel better. 

Tomorrow I’m leaving for a new country, very traditional and far from accepting non-binary people. I’ll spend the next months pretending to be someone I’m not and all those things together are just making me so angry at myself and my life... And gosh do I feel alone. 

Enough with the whining...! Any other AMAB people went through similar experiences? How do you deal with that?

What is with all these people assuming nonbinary people are just looking to rebel? I'm pretty much a goody two shoes. Teacher's pet, hard worker. What the heck am I rebelling against by having atypical gender dysphoria?



What is with the assumption that we are all looking for attention? I'm pretty reserved.

75,2018-08-17 06:15:56,97zwid,0,1,"So a few months ago I posted some rather depressed, hopeless posts on how I really didn't think I was ever going to be out properly as transmasc nonbinary, that I was struggling, that I didn't know how to come out to my husband of 12 years or if he would accept it... I was in a pretty dark place.

And then some things happened.

I played a video game (Detroit: Become Human) which, without spoiling, had a main character that I really related to. Like, he was conflicted, he struggled with his identity vs. his duty, he was even scared of being perceived a certain way, even though those around him pushed him towards being his true self.

He was afraid. I was afraid, too.

Some time while playing that game, I had an epiphany and it was this: that I'm always going to be nonbinary whether I accept it or not, I'm always going to be nonbinary whether I come out or not, but that accepting it and trusting others to accept it will bring me a sense of peace and allow me to stop feeling guilty and conflicted about it. That if I didn't come to terms with it, it was going to destroy me.

After that window shattered, it took me about a week to compose a letter to my husband explaining that I feel more masculine than feminine (I'm AFAB), that I suffer gender dysphoria, and that while I'm still too scared to transition, it may be something I need to pursue and in the meantime I definitely need to do more as my dysphoria is becoming crippling. I asked for his support. I didn't really know how much of it I would get since he's never shown more than a passing interest in masculine individuals and has said mixed things on trans issues in general.

Things went way better than I expected. I cried a lot, we've had tons of talks, just hours of speaking at length about my feelings and he's better than OK with it, he basically said that he's known in some sense for a long time and he loves me for me. He has a lot to learn but he's been so open to learning and that's so huge I can't even describe how it feels.

Then he tried using masculine/neutral terms for me and it feels good, like now he calls me his partner and sometimes his husband and oh, the gender euphoria is so good!!

Suddenly I feel a lot of hope for the future. I still have some bugs to work out, I still don't know where I'm going regarding transitioning, but I feel like I've broken the wall in my mind where I'd felt I had a choice between my gender and my marriage.

I am a 31 year old straight female (you'll have to excuse my lack of knowledge for labels I'm new to this all) who started dating a straight man, we got married after about 2 years of serious dating. During the beginning of our relationship i caught him messaging gay men on Craigslist, he broke down and expressed that when he was about 13 he was sexuality molested by a male neighbor. 

Long story short he told me that he was attracted to men and woman, also that he enjoyed dressing up as a woman from time to time but That he loved me and wanted to be with me. 

I am not homophobic. I believe people should love who ever they want and be who ever they want. I also knew that if i didn't at least try and see what his fetishes were about and let him express himself in any way he felt comfortable, or relationship would surely fail. 

Things were fine for a while till we got pregnant  (yay) and my patents had to move in causing him to closet his feelings again. He eventually behind my back started seeking attention from people online. Male attention. 

I threatend to leave, he still expressed his feelings and that he wanted to make it work. I told him he needed to start going to therapy just to address the feelings he had. Therapy worked well for us. I recommend it to any married couple even if there's no real problem in your relationship. During our most recent sessions he expressed that he sometimes felt like he feels like a woman in a mans body. That he is attracted to both sexes, and that there are days where he feels like a man. That is been a very hard thing for him to accept as he is obviously very conflicted with his identity and his whole family would not accept this at all. 

Our therapist quickly labeled him as a transgender, and although i value her opinion, a part of me feels like it was just a term she tossed out and maybe she's right. But i guess i wanted to post this in the hopes that maybe someone can relate and offer advice, maybe other subreddits?

107,2018-08-24 16:26:03,99yv0j,11,70,"I feel really stupid about this revelation honestly.  I’ve always prided myself on being very self aware. Since I was 4 years old, I’ve known that I wasn’t straight. My word for my sexual identity has evolved over time and now I sit happily under the umbrella term queer. But I never even considered that I wasn’t cisgendered. Except for all the red flags?? 

As a child I constantly wished to be seen as something different than my assigned gender, hated conforming to gender specific clothing and behavior, found it baffling when I watched others do it. I always had a hard time making friends with girls as a kid because I was just so not how they were, and we both knew it. The boys were more accepting but I was always disappointed when they would crushes on me instead of seeing me as one of the boys. As I got older and physically developed, others sexual attraction to me became more of a game, and I was always surprised when straight guys would like me but didn’t know how to explain that I felt more like a guy than a girl, although I was happy to be a girl most days? I eventually embraced my feminine side and became more comfortable with it but when I dress up, it feels far more like a fetishization than a true presentation, no matter how masc or femme I present. I accepted at an early age that some people were not the same gender that they were born as. I loved to play with peoples ideas of gender and norms and whatever. I’m very accepting of deviation from the gender norm in my social circle. Also as I’ve grown older, I became more and more interested and educated on feminism, which expanded my ideas and acceptance of others and myself.

But I have also had this deep seated internal prejudice/homophobia(?) against people who were assigned female at birth and claiming to be genderqueer. I hated making new friends with non-binary people and feeling like I was giving lip service when I said I supported them. And I do! But inside was a big tangled jumble of feelings about the whole thing, and ultimately I (privately) rejected the idea as a “real thing”. Which did not feel great. 

Somehow, last night it just clicked. I had a convo earlier with a young man who came out as gay recently and I told him that coming out is really a lifelong process, even to yourself. I was giggling later at a few times it went right over my head that why I was excited for somethings was because I was queer AF. And then, Lightbulb Moment. All the days of being seen as a girl that would send me home to  dress masc in private. My wish to be removed from gender and just be me without labels. My hero’s, my style icons. The stuff I like to do sexually. A friends very astute observation that I was more like a drag queen/cross dresser than a woman dressing up. The jarring moments I have when I am being hailed as a ma’am or a miss and how I just feel so thrown off by others perception of me. The fact that I’m married to a man but sometimes consider myself his gay, male lover (if only in my head). My adoration of my female presenting body as a separate entity. My feeling of embracing femininity as more of a war cry, “rah rah, women can do anything!” than a “rah, rah, I can do anything!”My quiet and deep jealousy for the seemingly effortlessly masc presenting people. My quiet and deep jealousy for the seemingly effortlessly femme presenting people. My deep and abiding attraction for NB/GQ and Trans people, often times before they are even “out” to myself or others. How I like to dress, speak and style myself androgynously.

So I came out as genderqueer to my three best friends (husband, cousin, BFF) last night. Although my husband doesn’t understand he is very supportive. My cousin also doesn’t understand but she also supports me to be whoever I am. My BFF said she could see it, that a part of me is not feminine or masculine and that’s just who I am. She also said that she thought I always knew this about myself XD. 

Now I feel a bit overwhelmed. I don’t think I’m ready or interested in changing anything socially in particular, but I also feel like I have this big juicy truth to explore and become a more authentic me. I have lots of questions that probably only I can answer....I want to release my internalized homophobia against others like myself, and I think that’s gonna start with being compassionate with the weirdo in the mirror and what they would like to do and be.

I eventually embraced my feminine side and became more comfortable with it but when I dress up, it feels far more like a fetishization than a true presentation, no matter how masc or femme I present. I accepted at an early age that some people were not the same gender that they were born as. I loved to play with peoples ideas of gender and norms and whatever. I’m very accepting of deviation from the gender norm in my social circle. Also as I’ve grown older, I became more and more interested and educated on feminism, which expanded my ideas and acceptance of others and myself.\n\nBut I have also had this deep seated internal prejudice/homophobia(?) against people who were assigned female at birth and claiming to be genderqueer. I hated making new friends with non-binary people and feeling like I was giving lip service when I said I supported them. And I do! But inside was a big tangled jumble of feelings about the whole thing, and ultimately I (privately) rejected the idea as a “real thing”. Which did not feel great. \n\nSomehow, last night it just clicked. I had a convo earlier with a young man who came out as gay recently and I told him that coming out is really a lifelong process, even to yourself. I was giggling later at a few times it went right over my head that why I was excited for somethings was because I was queer AF. And then, Lightbulb Moment. All the days of being seen as a girl that would send me home to  dress masc in private. My wish to be removed from gender and just be me without labels. My hero’s, my style icons. The stuff I like to do sexually. A friends very astute observation that I was more like a drag queen/cross dresser than a woman dressing up. The jarring moments I have when I am being hailed as a ma’am or a miss and how I just feel so thrown off by others perception of me. The fact that I’m married to a man but sometimes consider myself his gay, male lover (if only in my head). My adoration of my female presenting body as a separate entity. My feeling of embracing femininity as more of a war cry, “rah rah, women can do anything!” than a “rah, rah, I can do anything!”My quiet and deep jealousy for the seemingly effortlessly masc presenting people. My quiet and deep jealousy for the seemingly effortlessly femme presenting people. My deep and abiding attraction for NB/GQ and Trans people, often times before they are even “out” to myself or others. How I like to dress, speak and style myself androgynously.\n\nSo I came out as genderqueer to my three best friends (husband, cousin, BFF) last night. Although my husband doesn’t understand he is very supportive. My cousin also doesn’t understand but she also supports me to be whoever I am. My BFF said she could see it, that a part of me is not feminine or masculine and that’s just who I am. She also said that she thought I always knew this about myself XD. \n\nNow I feel a bit overwhelmed. I don’t think I’m ready or interested in changing anything socially in particular, but I also feel like I have this big juicy truth to explore and become a more authentic me. I have lots of questions that probably only I can answer....I want to release my internalized homophobia against others like myself, and I think that’s gonna start with being compassionate with the weirdo in the mirror and what they would like to do and be. Thanks for reading, this is like a huge secret I didn’t even know I had. I’m quite pleased to know that I’m just getting queerer with age.

133,2018-08-28 00:28:54,9aub3u,23,29,"Hi.  

I think I'm somewhere in the middle, maybe.  Growing up I always wanted to be a boy.  I played a boy in all the imaginary games I played with my friends.  From 1st grade onward I dressed as a boy and loved being ""miss-gendered.""  I was a pretty happy agender kid.  I've wondered, what if I was born 20 years later.  What if gender-queer was a thing when I was growing up (not saying it wasn't a term in 1995, I didn't even know anyone who was out and trans until college).  Since 9th grade, I've flirted with being more female, having long hair at times, wearing tight-fitted clothes.  

I want to be androgynous, I want people to look at me and not know my gender.  But I am more in the ""both genders"" than neither gender.  I got sir'd in an airport twice recently wearing a hoodie and pajama pants, but that's not something I'm going to wear to work.  I'm 5'4"" 145lbs, with shortly cropped hair, body hair, large breasts and an hourglass figure.  I mostly wear skirts because chronic pelvic pain doesn't really let me wear pants other than loose pajama pants.  I want to have skinny hips and small/no breasts and less body-fat, I worry though that if I didn't have breasts and hips I'd look fat.  I dress pretty feminine, dresses, skirts, because it looks good, and I can't wear pants.  If I wear clothes that cover my curves I look shabby and frumpy (the only being able to wear pajama pants doesn't help).  Pretty much I want to look like a thin girlish looking boy, but my body won't let me so instead I look like a butch girl in a dress.  I also really like cute dresses, and I like to be cute, bleh so many conflicting messages.

Also, I am in a masculine field, I have a lot of masculine hobbies.  I think it's important to be like fuck yeah, girls are here too, and we can be here and represent.  Like I'm constantly trying to prove, girls can do this, and that girls don't have follow beauty standards.  I feel like throwing away my gender would be giving in or being a bad feminist.  And I am a woman politically, woman's rights are incredibly important to me.  They are my rights, pregnancy, abortion, my body is female whether I want it to be or not.

Lastly it all seems like so much effort.  I'm not that open about being bi/pansexual and most people assume I'm straight.  (Like I told a friend of 6 years, last week, because it came up.)  I don't lie about it, I just don't work it into conversations because I don't know how.  I mean if I'm not actively putting it out there that I'm bi, don't always correct people's assumptions that I'm straight, and I know I've been bi since I heard the term at 14, am I really going to start correcting people's pronouns.

I'm new to this. I apologize if I seem biased or naive in anyway.  I don't know why I'm writing this.  Maybe because I don't know anyone who's genderqueer to talk to about this stuff, my partner can listen but not relate.

I mean if I\'m not actively putting it out there that I\'m bi, don\'t always correct people\'s assumptions that I\'m straight, and I know I\'ve been bi since I heard the term at 14, am I really going to start correcting people\'s pronouns.\n\nI\'m new to this. I apologize if I seem biased or naive in anyway.  I don\'t know why I\'m writing this.

""Excuse me, but you two look beautiful together. You are so brave. God bless you both!""

For the longest time, I thought maybe I was gay because I had overwhelming urges to give a friend head as a young teenager. And it happened often. But I also got incredibly turned on by seeing cleavage in class and would totally lose it. Playboys were always a thrill and stashed in the guest house.

I don’t know, it’s like sometimes, I’m internally more towards a feminine, submissive side, and I want to be used for pleasure. Other times, I want to fuck or make love to certain chicks with a raging passion, push their limits, and/or fuck them until they can’t walk straight. It all depends on who it is, and what kind of chemistry there is. 

I suppress all my feminine feelings and whatnot, and it’s really fucked me up. Like when I do mushrooms, I can feel it come forth, and it feels so good. But suppressing it, being ashamed of it,  and never talking about it has had a negative outcome. 

Like with my ex girlfriend, she was the first, of fifteen chicks, that I had truly had sex with and made love to. From the moment I saw her, I knew we’d wind up in deep shit. The sex was, and still is, absolutely incredible.

But there’s a side of me that so badly wants to be used strictly for blowjobs. Like just pleasuring some guy with a huge cock. Letting him force my head down, his cock all the way down my throat, let him thrust in my mouth, like literally; however he sees it fit to use my face. And I also wouldn’t mind being mounted and fucked, at all. It all comes down to being used for pleasure, and that’s it.

I experimented with a co-worker once, he was very feminine, I wasn’t into it. That’s as far as I’ve gone with any guy.

And all this is driving me insane. I believe it’s where my drinking and substance abuse problem stems from. My mother was the exact same way, was into both men and women, some people claim she was a lesbian. She’d never admit to it. She holed up in her room for the better part of thirty years, she was hateful when she drank, she had no control over herself, and eventually drank herself to death. 

I am fucking mortified of turning out that way, and quite frankly, I don’t want to wind up pissing all my potential and everything I have away. I’m also forty days clean of booze. This is all extremely confusing and fucks my head up.

I felt invalid but You guys have helped me realize the opposite. I *am* valid and so are all of you; no matter what you identify as youare valid. You are worth it. While you may go really low at points you will come back. So please, please, don't hurt yourself others and stay alive. You might not realize how much you mean to someone.

Example: I generally feel that I lack a gender and my shifts/fluctuations go towards masculinity and return to my base of agender.   
**Is your fluidity binary or nonbinary or something else?:** binary / nonbinary / other  
Example: My friend shifts gender feelings from girl to boy, along the gender binary, whereas I shift along neutral to masculine, in a nonbinary manner. I know others who shift from feminine to faelike, which could identify as neither binary nor nonbinary.  
**Does your gender shift due to presentation?** y/n  
Example: Although I never get ""natural"" shifts towards feminine, if I wear skirts and makeup, I often perform feminine and my gender can shift to feminine because of it.   
**Does your gender shift consistently across time? Daily / weekly / monthly?** \[varied answers\]  
Example: You might wake up as a different gender every day, or change genders multiple times throughout one day. Or, you may only get shifts infrequently one or two days a month.

according to a lot of people
I’m not real

One day I feel like a boy
And one day I feel like a girl
And then the next day
It’s either/or

But that can’t be real
Because I’m not a boy or a girl
And that’s not okay
Right-winged conservatives won’t even give who I am a whirl

No, I don’t want to be a special snowflake
No, I’m not just a butch lesbian
Bigots think my gender is just something I make
Something they can just take

Some days I feel so down I can’t do anything
Some days I feel so afraid I can’t do anything
I curl up in a ball
I hid in my seat
I shake and sweat and breathe

But the Lord if I just turned to the Lord
It would all be okay
Because this disorder, this disease
Isn’t real
Truth is that there’s nothing in the world

That could make this any less real

But if I just stopped worrying
If I used your eucalyptus spray, your anti stress balm
I’d be okay

But I don’t feel okay but they say I am
If I just keep moving, if I just look
Look down at myself, a robot
I’d be okay
But I’m not okay.

77,2018-08-22 17:26:28,99fal9,6,3,"Hi, ive been lurking here for a while but never posted until now. 

The second person I came out to was my roommate. He's a guy ive known since high school, and weve continued to be friends into our late 20s, and we now live in the same apartment. Im assigned male, but have been out as genderfluid to a handful of close friends for a few months, and i crossdress as a woman in private. One time when i was dressed up, i decided on impulse that i would tell my roommate, that it would come up eventually anyway. I sent him a text to give him a little warning, and i was still dressed when he got home. His initial reaction seemed supportive and positive, but I soon saw that there were problems under the surface. After I came out to him he avoided me for 3 days. When i next came home from work, he hugged me as i walked in, but also explained that he needed time to wrap his head around this. I didnt know how to interpret that, so I partially went back into the closet when I was around him (which is often, since we live under the same roof).

As the months went on, I was feeling restless to do more with my crossdressing, to hang out as a woman with some of my friends who ive told. Before I said anything about this, my roommate approached me and partially apologized, saying hed done some more research and he had changed his attitude on genderfluidity. He said he mistakenly believed that my crossdressing was a ""fetish that [I] was involving [him] in"", which was why hed been weird about it, but now he wanted to be more supportive. So, i thought that meant things were looking up, and that i could be more open around him. 

Then last weekend, a friend of ours was performing at a local bar, and i had an idea that maybe i would go as a woman, since all of my friends who were going were people who already knew about me. But id never gone in public before and I was extremely nervous. I didnt know whether it was selfish of me to hijack this existing plan for revealing myself. My roommate was not going to this event, so i knocked on his door (while halfway changed into womens clothing) because i wanted to ask his advice. He cut me off before i could finish and told me ""I cant make that decision for you"" in a tone that made me think he saw this as an inappropriate question. I said ""ok"", shrank back into my room, changed back into male clothes, and went out as a guy. I felt really hurt, that it had felt like he had been dusgusted by me.

Over the next few days, he was noticeably colder towards me, and last night he passed me in the hall looking right at me,  ignored me when I said hi, and shut the door to his room. I texted him asking if he wanted to talk and i could tell something was wrong. He didnt reply. Earlier today, after radio silence all night, I asked if I could at least ask whether this was about my gender? It was; he sent me a really long angry text about how it was out of line for me to have asked him for advice on sunday, and how ""as we had discussed"" (no we didnt) he was fine with me doing whatever i wanted as long as I didnt involve him, and he called this being ""supportive"". He said he'd overlook it because he could see i had been feeling vulnerable that day, but that this couldnt happen again. 

Now I feel shocked and even more hurt. He seems to have this idea that I can just isolate the genderfluid part of myself and keep it away from him, or that if I show it in any capacity Ill be infecting him or something. I didnt say anything in reply to his text except ""id like to talk about this tonight"". 

So here i am. I guess I just want to know if anyone had advice on how to deal with people in your life who clearly arent as open-minded as they think they are, and if theres any way I can help him understand.

They came out to me in full garb/dress, two weeks after signing a year long lease into our second year of living together. I was uncomfortable. Immediately I expressed that I'd be supportive in their decisions, that they are the same person, and it doesn't really affect me which is true.  I'm struggling to believe my own words. This person is naturally sensitive so I knew immediately that I needed to choose my words wisely and only show support.  I then asked them if they wanted to sit and watch a movie at home. We did. I felt incredibly uncomfortable.

I only wanted to show support because otherwise you're a villain. That's fact. I didn't' let any of my personal beliefs known because I didn't think my opinion would add anything beneficial and only serve to hurt. I'm not comfortable. I don't think that support and comfort are the same thing. I think I can be supportive and uncomfortable at the same time. 

I just don't want added drama in my life or to be involved with any decision making. Everybody has their own issues and i'm not involving them in any of mine because that would be unfair to burden someone else with my issues. I thought I expressed this over a few talks. I don't feel qualified to offer my opinions in case they negatively affect this person. 

The other night they told me they were thinking about going out as a female that night. I said i don't want to weigh in. I'm not answering. They came to me the other day saying that due to that encounter they chose not to change that night. 

I think that's entirely unfair. It feels like I'm involved in a relationship I didn't sign up for. I told them again that I'm uncomfortable in offering advice. Exactly what I was trying to avoid happened.  I keep telling them that those decisions cant come from me and i'm not available to give them my opinion and that my opinion doesn't matter anyway it needs to come from inside them. 

I've pretty consistently said something along the lines of the following when asked what I Think: ""Fuck my opinion, I can't tell you what to do as much as you can control the color of my eyes. It shouldn't matter to you what I think. You pay rent like I do. I don't control any of your actions. You don't control any of mine. I have no power over you. ""

I'm not comfortable being used as a stepping stone for their bravery, because when they lack the courage to be what they want then I'll get blamed. I feel like that already happened. 

They mentioned me acting distant and cold when they even approach the subject. I know they inject a lot of their own fears and imagination into scenarios like this. For instance we went to see a movie in public and they wore earrings. They took them off after the movie. They told me yesterday they blamed me for not talking to them during the movie and that also affected his decision.  I didn't say anything...because we're in a fucking movie! That's one of my all time pet peeves and they know this. No phones and no talking. I literally just paid for that time. Again I think this is entirely unfair to blame me for their feelings. I have no idea what to do .

They asked me if i'd be comfortable going to an event with our friends with them as a female.  I honestly don't think I would. But I lied. Because otherwise I'm the villain. It shouldn't matter what I think!

I'm trying to educate myself, I'm trying to be supportive, but I'm not comfortable. There's nothing to do, no actions to take.

110,2018-08-31 13:44:30,9btq69,10,15,"Hi everyone! I have a bunch of questions I want to ask. I hope you don't mind if they're a little basic, but I really want to hear the experiences and stuff of other genderfluid people.

First off, HRT. I found a doctor in my area with a reputation of being really helpful to trans people wanting HRT (like in and out with an E or T prescription). I'm not sure if HRT is for me though. Some days, I look in the mirror and like (or at least don't mind) what I see in the mirror. Other days, I really wish I looked more fem. I'm worried that HRT might just flip those days, or worse, just make me disappointed that I don't look fem enough and that I don't look masc enough. For those of you who have pursued HRT, did you feel like it helped you fell more confident/comfortable with yourself? Is there any advice/things you wish you had known?

My next question is kind of about names. I have a masc name and a fem name, and I really like both. Switching back and forth seems like a hassle, both for me and for everyone who needs to address me. Would you recommend just finding a gender neutral name to use? I'm not keen on switching my names around, but I'm not sure what other solution there would be.

Last question (for now) is about professionalism. How do you manage your gender in the workplace or during a job search? Do you keep the fluidity hidden and just present one way or another? I guess, how do you handle that while trying to be professional?

Sorry if these questions are basic, but I feel so lost and confused. Sometimes I wish I was just cis or a transwoman so I could just slot myself into an established gender and call it good.
