Is this a problem you feel passionate about? Does it even matter? 

Are there any online retailers which you feel have got this right?

Do you tend to buy your clothes from stores catering specifically to non-binary customers, or do you shop at general stores?

Is it problematic that 'men's clothes' and 'women's clothes' have (to my knowledge) different ways of describing the size?

It masterfully brings up issues such as transphobia and homophobia, as well as anti-intersex thoughts and crimes, and sexism, all through fictional devices used as extended metaphors.

[MINOR SPOILERS] The book follows the two siblings Edie and Gnome through their lives in early 18th century England. There is only one problem: they share the same body. In the day, they are Edie - who is not aware of Gnome - and in the night, her body transforms into her brother Gnome’s male body, and he takes over the control. They must of course keep this a secret, for their own safety’s sake.

The book explores the relationship between gender and gender roles, as well as sexuality and “not fitting in”. It also has other sub-plots that it follows, such as the Suffragettes’ movement, and the gay and queer lives and rights movement of England.

All in all, it’s an amazing book, it is beautifully written, and it really makes you think of what it can mean to be queer.

I recently came out as non-binary at the age of 24. While I have known for quite some time, I was unable to accept myself and nurture my identities until very recently. This occurred for a number of reasons, but most importantly because I am a fairly new Ph.D. student at a large R1 university. I suppose I feared more backlash from professors and my fellow graduate students than I previously received, simply based on my race in an environment that does not support POCs. 

While I have learned to love myself and be my authentic self in a number of spaces, I am struggling with finding community (i.e. there are not a lot of Black, queer, enby academics). And while I know that community does not have to shared all of these identities, I have found very few people who shared even two of these identities in my activist and academic spaces.

I came close to do surgery and take hormones to have my body non-binary conforming, based on what is ""expected"" for people who are genderqueer. I had major body dysphoria at that point as genderfluid, being that my gender identity fluctuated through the gender spectrum. An LGBTQ+ psychologist pointed out that what is important is that you are okay with yourself and not pay too much attention to how others perceive you - if surgery helps, by all means, but think about what that entails. That helped me a lot and gave me a lot of strength and empowerment on my identity. I gave up the idea of changing myself to meet society's expectations, and it made me realise how messed up our society actually is.

But that is my experience. I realise that everyone has their journeys; everyone's lives are different, some more privileged than others. I often hear people say that they want to look a certain way and will go through lengths to reach it. As I write this I realise my post might be seen as something very ignorant, on the other hand, it might be seen as not. While I honestly believe that everyone should do whatever makes them feel happy, me being one of these people, I also wonder why is it not okay to simply be how we are? That it is okay to be a dude with a vagina or a woman with a penis. Is this not something society keeps telling us how we are supposed to be? That the representation of transmen and transwomen are often represented by a muscular man or very feminine woman? That non-binary people are people who obviously look like they haven't got a distinct gender? That kind of ideas messed me up big time for many years; and surely you might have experienced this too? Isn't our body dysphoria a product of society telling us how we are to be? Then the things we do to ourselves to become what society expects us to be? If we do not meet those standards, we are called snowflakes and marginalised.

A few years back, in a Pride, there was a lecture by a gay cis-man saying he was against marriage equality. He was against it because approving marriage equality would only welcome a handful of people into the inner circle of society and elude a country to be ""LGBTQ-friendly"". The rest of the LGBTQ+ community would still be marginalised, and thereby forgotten because ""we finally got marriage equality"". While trans-men who look like ""men"" and trans-women who look like ""women"" is now more accepted, being non-binary or trans without conforming with trans-gender-stereotypes is not. The LGBTQ+ community is a *very* diverse group and it is honestly impossible to put LGBTQ+ people in boxes as there are so many different identities. I honestly love being part of this community, and proudly wave the rainbow flag. I am concerned though that our community, especially the younger generation, are feeling forced/expected to be a certain way.

73,2018-04-08 02:32:31,8an4qz,14,48,"I was wrong. [30ish, AMAB, NB, they/them, just dont call me sir. This is about to get very very very long, but i just need to write it out]

[BACKGROUND]

I grew up in a very small town. Until around the time I got into middle school, the entire school district, outside of the high school, had a single combined year book consisting of maybe 60 pages in a paper back book. I had very very limited exposure, if at all, to anything outside of white, hetero relationships. Everyone went to church and all the adults in my life (my parents included) had got married to their high school sweethearts at 20 and stayed in town. 

I was very sheltered from sexual stuff, while also being exposed to its effects by my father's repeated philandering. I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn't. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.

By high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don't think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.

When I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I ""put a ring on it"" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn't wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my ""first."" It was the right thing to do.

During the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two ""out"" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a ""don't ask don't tell"" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. 

After around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I'm not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the ""right thing.""]

Thus began my ""wild oats"" phase. I hooked up with my ""Rachael,"" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.

[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]

Which brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we'll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn't seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. 

It was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.

Sue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn't want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).

We were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren't awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. 

[SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT]

Three years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can't really describe the feeling, it wasn't that it felt ""right"" it just felt ""good."" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.

A couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn't for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn't want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black ""corset"" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.

She freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I'm fairly certain she cried.

The next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn't something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn't home. I never said I wouldn't, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.

After a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn't make me gay, I'm not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. ""I'm not trans, but I am queer. I just don't know what that means at this point."" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn't think ""crossdresser"" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn't have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way ""queer,"" or just beyond the ""norm."" I knew it meant something to me.

But I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.

I look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was ""rough"" but we were making it through. 

And maybe we were?

One night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1"" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn't WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.

I wouldn't try to change my voice and I hadn't been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn't like that I would ""act different."" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was ""a dude in a dress,"" but she didn't want me to change myself. Every time the ""dude in a dress"" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn't sure how to fully communicate that.

[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]

I feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a ""purge."" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.

Sue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.

But it did get normalized. 

I broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.

But I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would ""come out"" because I didn't know what I would ""come out"" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.

We bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our ""options."" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself ""wait, you can't do that, you're about to be a father."" And I started crying.

We had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about ""alternative families during their first pregnancy"" and brought it up to Sue. ""Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that."" 

After the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was ""trans-trans."" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a ""woman trapped in a mans body."" I didn't feel like there was this ""old me"" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.

Late last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.

I realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.

That month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my ""timeline or endpoint."" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. 

And the more I explored ""NBness"" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.

The floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. 

I started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn't go to the gym, and carrying a purse.

[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]

Christmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I'm out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I'm the same person I've always been. And I blew it.

I don't know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter's christmas presents. 

It wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being ""bitchy"" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn't drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.

But the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970's NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.

Her father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what 'non-binary' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: 

He said, ""if you start a relationship with a person and say, 'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don't like that we shouldnt get together.' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave."" 

I understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I've skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.

Sue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.

A month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: 

1) I am hurting people by doing what I'm doing

2) She wishes I was ""normal"" again

3) I don't think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.

I tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I've thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.

Not satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don't stop then I ""dont care about [my daughter].""

That hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me ""youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it."" I walked past her repeating ""leave me alone leave me alone"" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.

The woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sam knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said ""here's johnny."" 

I deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.

It was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn't try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.

I was alone. 

And I've been alone ever since.

I have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I'll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I've been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.

I've had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I've still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.

I was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won't be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.

I'm so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.

I have a really great friend from work that started after I was ""out"" and she's been such a huge support. I've reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.

I didn't get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough ""notice."" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.

I had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. 

I am up for a big promotion so I've had to go in on weekends and stay late.

I havent left my couch all day today. I don't even think I've turned on a light for more than a second.

I thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I've had my blinders on to all those times she wasn't supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.

I doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.

TL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.

Until around the time I got into middle school, the entire school district, outside of the high school, had a single combined year book consisting of maybe 60 pages in a paper back book. I had very very limited exposure, if at all, to anything outside of white, hetero relationships. Everyone went to church and all the adults in my life (my parents included) had got married to their high school sweethearts at 20 and stayed in town. \n\nI was very sheltered from sexual stuff, while also being exposed to its effects by my father\'s repeated philandering. I grew up knowing I was going to be the BEST dad ever. I was going to be there how my father wasn\'t. I was going to find a girlfriend, marry her, have kids, and settle back into my home town. I would be faithful and loyal. I would listen to my child.\n\nBy high school, the town had grown considerably, but it was still a very small town vibe. I was a very late bloomer. I don\'t think I fully went through puberty until 14. I had a LOT of short (~6 mo) relationships over the course of HS and would have puppy-dog-crushes on EVERY girl. There were several who I got *close* to sleeping with, but I really had no idea how any of that worked and we just never sealed the deal.\n\nWhen I got to college, I thought I had failed by not marrying my HS sweetheart. When I found a girl that reciprocated my affections, she was the first girl I ever slept with. I ""put a ring on it"" after 8 months and married her after knowing her a year and a half. While we didn\'t wait until we were married (and had a lot of shame about it) I felt a lot of pride in having married my ""first."" It was the right thing to do.\n\nDuring the course of that relationship, I had started working at a major coffee chain to provide us with heath care. The group of people I worked with were some of my first close exposure to anyone on the LGBT spectrum. There were two ""out"" gay kids in my HS, but that was definitely outside the norm and it was a ""don\'t ask don\'t tell"" subject, even though I friends with one of them. When I started at the coffee shop, a person said they had gone to Pride that weekend and I asked which zoo it was at, thinking it was a special lion exhibit. \n\nAfter around 2 years, it came out that my wife had been cheating on me with a TA in her class and we divorced. [I\'m not really upset about that anymore. Neither of us had any business together and we were never a good fit. Just two small town kids trying to do the ""right thing.""]\n\nThus began my ""wild oats"" phase. I hooked up with my ""Rachael,"" a girl that had always lead me on since forever, I had my first one night stand, I had casual relations with a friend that had also just gone though a divorce, I drank til the bars shut down, and had a really really good time.\n\n[THE BALLAD OF BILLY JOE AND BOBBIE SUE]\n\nWhich brings us to about 8 years ago. I met my SO, we\'ll call her Sue, though common friends at work. She would come and hang out with us at the bars, and we would always flirt and have a good time. She seemed so open to the world, at least compared to what I had known. She didn\'t seem to care what people thought of her. She was edgy and dark. She liked true crime and smoked weed and was the exact opposite of everything I had ever gone for in a person. One night we ended up together. \n\nIt was magnetic. It was passionate. It was the most deep and surreal connection I had ever felt with someone. I had a hard time walking the next day. We just got each other on some other level and have been practically attached at the hip ever since.\n\nSue knew I had rushed into my last major relationship and didn\'t want to repeat the same mistakes, but within 2 years we were living together, had traveled the country, and were known to always be down for a good time (we threw some of the most epic rager parties anyone has ever seen).\n\nWe were very open with each other sexually and always trying new things. We weren\'t awkward around each other even the slightest bit. I had found my best friend and my favorite person on earth. We laughed, we cried, we would argue but always make up, and we just grew so tightly together. Neither of us had good parental relationships modeled to us, so we had to teach each other how to communicate our feelings. \n\n[SOMETHING\'S DIFFERENT]\n\nThree years in, a little over 5 years ago, I was back at the coffee shop, working very early hours (4am - 1pm) and would get several hours alone before my SO got home. As I said, we had both been very open with trying new things in our sex life, and one of those things was me wearing her panties. It was just a spicy little thing we did. Well one day on a whim I decided to try on one of her bras. I can\'t really describe the feeling, it wasn\'t that it felt ""right"" it just felt ""good."" It felt a little dirty, and a little weird, but it definitely moved the needle for me.\n\nA couple weeks later was Valentines Day. I didn\'t for a second thing she would judge me and I wanted to explore these feelings together, and I didn\'t want to hide anything from her. Spoiler alert: it did NOT go well. As such, I think I have blocked out a lot of it. But I know I did not look good. I was always a big burly guy with a big beard. I had a thick carpet of chest hair. I think I had a on a black ""corset"" kind of thing and some fishnets, it was all stuff from her underwear drawer.\n\nShe freaked out. I had imagined she would see me, we would meet in the middle of the room, and just go to town on each other like we always did. I\'m fairly certain she cried.\n\nThe next few months were tough. She made it very clear she was not into it, but the more she resisted the more I realized it meant something to me. It wasn\'t something I could just stop, but I did go to it being very private. Only when she wasn\'t home. I never said I wouldn\'t, but I tried to be respectful of her not wanting to see it.\n\nAfter a big fight about it, maybe 6-8 months in, we had a sit down on our back porch. I told her that it didn\'t make me gay, I\'m not attracted to men, I just like feeling pretty some times. ""I\'m not trans, but I am queer. I just don\'t know what that means at this point."" I had discovered r/cd, and while I participated and loved it, I didn\'t think ""crossdresser"" fully described the way I felt. But given my background, I just didn\'t have the vocabulary to describe it. I had no frame of reference. But I knew I was in some way ""queer,"" or just beyond the ""norm."" I knew it meant something to me.\n\nBut I persisted and would periodically be en femme when she got home from work. I would get dolled up in whatever mishmash of clothes she had that would fit me, clean the house with a glass of wine, and nervously wait for her to get home.\n\nI look at my posts/comments from that time and see me trying DESPERATELY to convince myself I was getting somewhere with her. That it was ""rough"" but we were making it through. \n\nAnd maybe we were?\n\nOne night, she took me to walmart at midnight and helped me get a pair of cheap 1"" heels and I was over the moon. I couldn\'t WAIT to get home from work the next day and walk around in them. She started to come around to helping me get some clothes at the mall, but very basic stuff. Any time she made a bag for the goodwill, I would go thru it and pull out anything that fit me and tuck it away. My bottom drawer of my dresser became the sanctuary. She took me to get a pedicure with her, she would paint my nails, I thought I was getting through to her.\n\nI wouldn\'t try to change my voice and I hadn\'t been clean shaven in 5 years. But she said she didn\'t like that I would ""act different."" Crossing my legs at the knee, being the little spoon. She had wrapped her head around the fact that I was ""a dude in a dress,"" but she didn\'t want me to change myself. Every time the ""dude in a dress"" comment came up, I would add that it was more to it than that, but I wasn\'t sure how to fully communicate that.\n\n[JESUS, THIS IS TOO LONG]\n\nI feel very lucky that through all of this I never had a ""purge."" Over the next few years I told a select couple of friends about my crossdressing. I went to the mall en femme a few times. I got more confident shopping for myself. I moved all my feminine undergarments out of my main underwear drawer into their own. I bought shoes from Payless online and frilly dresses from charlotte russe. I found more excuses to shave. I shaved my chest a few times.\n\nSue and I had a few times where she would go stay at her parents, but when we got back together we would establish new boundaries and move forward. I told myself things were getting better, I told myself she was coming around. I realize now I guess I was just forcing it on her and she was putting up with it.\n\nBut it did get normalized. \n\nI broke off ties with my family over unrelated toxicity, and she was there for me. We would travel, we started introducing each other as husband and wife even though we werent married. We were a unit. Outside of this very specific facet of our relationship we were extremely happy.\n\nBut I still felt the draw to be more public with it. I never thought I would ""come out"" because I didn\'t know what I would ""come out"" as, but I would shave my legs or get them waxed and wear shorts around people without fear.\n\nWe bought a house together 2 years ago. When we found out we were pregnant we really had a long and frank discussion of our ""options."" I remember driving to her parents house before we had told them, daydreaming about something, and I thought to myself ""wait, you can\'t do that, you\'re about to be a father."" And I started crying.\n\nWe had the baby late in 2016. During the pregnancy, the urgency to crossdress went down, but not fully away. I was desperately trying to find a new job and I remember a casting call for a TLC show about ""alternative families during their first pregnancy"" and brought it up to Sue. ""Oh, is that still a thing? I thought you were over that."" \n\nAfter the baby came, I continued to crossdress, but it felt like more than that. I really wondered if I was ""trans-trans."" So much of the common experience on the trans subreddits resonated with me, but I never felt like a ""woman trapped in a mans body."" I didn\'t feel like there was this ""old me"" I had to get rid of. But I wanted to be more outwardly feminine.\n\nLate last year I saw a post about a person that felt just like me. I reached out in DM to ask if there were anywhere I could find more people like us and they pointed me to /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer. FINALLY. I found my people.\n\nI realized that I just wanted to be a person. I wanted to participate in the ""girly"" stuff I wasnt allowed to growing up. I wanted to wear makeup. I wanted to occasionally wear dresses or girly things. But I wanted to stay the same person.\n\nThat month I had a breakdown and drove over 300 miles in the middle of the night after another big fight. When I got back in the morning, I broke down ugly crying and told Sue that I was genderqueer. I had finally found the word to describe how I felt. She seemed receptive, but noted it scared her not knowing my ""timeline or endpoint."" I started to look for and secured a therapist to start working thru all these things. \n\nAnd the more I explored ""NBness"" the more I realized it just described me as a person. In politics, religion, everything, I had always maintained there was nuance, there was no strict black and white.\n\nThe floodgates opened. I came out to her mom, who would watch our daughter when we were at work. I came out to more and more of my friends. Around Christmas I started playing with wearing some mascara to work and eventually came out to my department. Everyone, and I mean everyone, was so supportive and understanding. \n\nI started presenting more femme at work, wearing full makeup on the two days a week I didn\'t go to the gym, and carrying a purse.\n\n[THE BEGINNING OF THE END]\n\nChristmas Eve. Hosting at our house for the first time. I\'m out to her mom, but no one else in her family. For whatever fucking reason I decide to put on makeup. I think in my mind I was going to be the most gracious host that just HAPPENED to be wearing makeup. It was my opportunity to show that I\'m the same person I\'ve always been. And I blew it.\n\nI don\'t know how it happened. I only remember pouring myself one drink, but I must have had a lot more because I have only VERY fuzzy memories of that night. I barely ever drink a full beer a night, much less get blackout drunk. I crashed out, woke up a few hours later, and started putting together my daughter\'s christmas presents. \n\nIt wasnt until over a week later that Sue decided to fill me in on what happened. Apparently I had ruined a board game by being belligerent. I was being ""bitchy"" and generally just not a very fun person. I really really have no idea what the hell happened. Like I said, I got up after they left and put together gifts and such, I wasn\'t drunk then, and I got up very early the next morning and was not hung over.\n\nBut the cat was out of the bag. Sue had to try to explain to her 1970\'s NYC dad what the hell I was. No one would talk to me directly. We all got the flu and I was miserable both physically and mentally.\n\nHer father met me for lunch when we had all recovered and I was delighted to find he had spent the week or two actually researching what \'non-binary\' meant. We had a very frank and respectful conversation, although he did have one thing that struck me wrong: \n\nHe said, ""if you start a relationship with a person and say, \'you should know I drink a beer every night and if you don\'t like that we shouldnt get together.\' The other person agrees. Over the years, the first person starts drinking a six pack a night. And then a handle of vodka. The other person agreed to one beer, and they have the right to leave."" \n\nI understood what he was saying, but I was so delusional as to how much Sue really did support me. Even as I type out this ridiculously long post, I\'ve skipped over many major fights on the subject. But I always saw the parts where she helped me and gave those more credence.\n\nSue was embarrassed about her mom seeing me go to work in makeup and more femme-presenting.\n\nA month ago, she sat me down and said she had three things to say and that I needed to listen without giving input. She said: \n\n1) I am hurting people by doing what I\'m doing\n\n2) She wishes I was ""normal"" again\n\n3) I don\'t think about how my daughter will be bullied because of me.\n\nI tried to explain to her that I want to live a life of openness and honesty for my daughter. I never want to hide myself from her. And of course I\'ve thought about her getting bullied because of me, but kids get bullied for a lot of reasons and I will work hard to give her the tools to deal with those situations when they arise.\n\nNot satisfied with that, she went on to say that if I don\'t stop then I ""dont care about [my daughter].""\n\nThat hurt. A lot. I was very very upset. I was boiling but asked for space, went to the other side of the house, and took my frustrations out on a cardboard box in the recycling. She followed me, telling me ""youre a 30 year old man and should be able to handle it."" I walked past her repeating ""leave me alone leave me alone"" and she followed. Ironically, I ended up in my closet, huddled on the floor crying and screaming out for help. She mocked me. I started looking for my phone and when I found it I did the only thing I could think to do in my agitated state, I called the Crisis Hotline.\n\nThe woman on the other side of the phone talked me through breathing exercises. I told her what had happened. As I was on the phone, I sat against our bedroom door since it doesnt latch. After 20 minutes, Sam knocked and asked if she could come in. I said no, that I needed space, and she started trying to push her way in. She was on the phone with her mother and mocking how I was crying on the phone with someone. At one point she was pushing very hard against the door and said ""here\'s johnny."" \n\nI deduced she was going to take my daughter to her parents. I arranged to have the crisis call center call me back so I could call the police.\n\nIt was midnight on a Wednesday. It was raining. I was calmed down from my talk on the phone, so I was trying not to re-escalate the situation. I told her not to go, but I didn\'t try to grab her keys or stand behind the car or anything. The crisis center had told me she couldnt just take her so I felt calm in thinking the police would help. When I called them they laughed at me.\n\nI was alone. \n\nAnd I\'ve been alone ever since.\n\nI have taken up WAY too much of everyones time here, so I\'ll spare everyone the details of the kind of toxicity I\'ve been dealing with this month, but it hasnt been great.\n\nI\'ve had my daughter at our house overnight twice since then. I have taken her to the zoo and a museum, I\'ve still gone to her doctors visits. But I mostly see her thru Facetime when Sue is okay with it.\n\nI was informed Friday when I asked to see her this weekend that Sue had gotten a lawyer and wants to sell the house. I won\'t be allowed to see my daughter alone until after mediation is complete.\n\nI\'m so fucking lost and also never been more confident in who I am.\n\nI have a really great friend from work that started after I was ""out"" and she\'s been such a huge support. I\'ve reconnected with my old friends and met so many new friends.\n\nI didn\'t get to see my daughter on easter weekend because I didnt give enough ""notice."" If I didnt have friends around itwould have been really tough. And I realized all the people I was hanging out with and having meaningful and thoughtful conversations with I had known less than a month.\n\nI had to pay the mortgage and bills for the last month, and hadnt been reimbursed for bills for the month before she left. I am so unbelievably broke and busking for money to eat. \n\nI am up for a big promotion so I\'ve had to go in on weekends and stay late.\n\nI havent left my couch all day today. I don\'t even think I\'ve turned on a light for more than a second.\n\nI thought I was one of the lucky ones, but I realize thru my therapy that I\'ve had my blinders on to all those times she wasn\'t supportive. And I really should have seen this coming.\n\nI doubt very seriously anyone is going to read this, but thanks if you did.\n\nTL;DR small town kid gets in touch with their femme side and it goes pretty okay until their entire life falls apart.\n\n\n\n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I thought I was one of the lucky ones.', 'created': 1523179951.0}"

I've questioned my gender a few times throughout my life. For a while I thought I might be trans but that never felt right, and I eventually just ignored and thought ""Oh I'm a guy--end of story.""

I feel as thought I'd be more comfortable in a feminine body such as filled out hips, curves etc. Yet, I don't know if I want breasts or enlarged female nipples, in fact it's a bit of a huge con for me (even though many who kinda identify the same way I do have told me they got used to the breasts and ended up liking them) and I'm also afraid that my face will become ""so feminine"" that I'd feel dysphoric bout that as well and look like an ""odd looking guy"".

Another thing that's been confusing me is the difference between aging as a male and aging as a male on female hormones. Will I continue to get more masculine as I grow older if I decide to not go on hormones? Some other physical differences, etc.  

As you can tell I'm a bit (okay, a lot) confused. I want to be able to pass and wear girl clothes/girly clothes, but when I see female faces/mtfs I feel like that isn't what would make me happy. I guess there is a large lack of AMAB non-binary representation so it makes it a bit harder.  

Also I'm 24/m/and a larger individual as well. I have ""moobs"" if you will. I'm also in a situation where i can't really express myself the way I'd want (religious family etc).

I’m new on Reddit but not so new to the whole transgender thing! After IDing as a binary trans guy for a good few years, I’m realising more and more that this doesn’t actually reflect who I am, and I recently started IDing myself more as a non-binary transmasc person (I’m AFAB)

When I thought I was a binary guy, I chose a stereotypically “male” name for myself and have used that consistently for around a year with certain friends (not family), but it never felt like it fit. Now that I’ve realised that forcing myself into yet another gender box ain’t gunna fly, I’m trying to two-birds-one-stone it with the whole name thing.

The whole way through my childhood, friends often called me by a more gender-neutral variant of my given name - Philly (I’m not from the US so that connotation isn’t as prevalent here). While I really dislike my legal name and feel uncomfortable being referred to with it, the shortened version is one that’s felt like *mine*. However I’m hesitant to start using it for a few reasons:

1) I want a name that’s as gender-neutral as possible and I’m not sure how much of a feminine connotation this name has - it’s shortened from a feminine name but there is a male name that could be shortened in the same way, I’ve just not heard it often?

2) I’m worried it won’t sound enough like a “real name” or that people won’t take it seriously 

3) I’m worried that without changing my name fully, and by continuing to use a nickname I’ve had for years (prior to coming out) people will think it’s not a “serious” change and continue to misgender me etc?

My name is Salem, i'm 18 and afab, and have generally considered myself cis, though i've never looked at it too deeply until the last year or so. 

since i was a kid i've worn ""boy"" clothes but have been comfy in them and never really cared if other girls in my class would say things. when people would mistake me for a boy i wouldn't be surprised or care, or sometimes correct them. 
i used to consider myself bi, but after dating a guy and lying to myself for a few months i felt comfortable with myself and was happier once i came to terms that i liked exclusively women/people identifying as a girl/femme. 
one thing that really struck a cord was how i dressed when i was in this straight relationship. i dressed a lot more feminine than i was used to (by this time i generally wore ""girl"" clothes but i started wearing skirts and crop tops and such) 
at first i thought it made me uncomfortable because i felt like i was fulfilling the typical gender role of a straight woman and it irked me because i was just repressing  about my sexuality. 
two years later i am very happy with the way i present though my straight friend often makes fun of me because it's ""too butch"", though it doesn't bother me. 

i've never felt like she/her pronouns resonated with me like male ones did, but i don't know that i could see myself fully transitioning. i feel some sort of disconnect with the idea of gender and not sure how to express it. i feel what i would describe as strong body dysmorphia when i wear anything that isn't pants and a sweater. i hate the idea of my body representing femininity, unless it is a very specific ""butch"" kind. 
I follow ChellaMan on twitter (transmasc blogger) and his story really resonates with me and i feel almost jealous (?) that he is able to be so comfortable with himself and that he has such a support system. 
i think the only thing holding me back from talking about this with my peers is the social view of nb people in my area (as kids that just want attention) and i'm not sure where else to turn.

As part of championing diversity, my workplace has begun a so-called Gender Intelligence Initiative.  Frankly, it's horrifying.  The entire premise is a gender-essentialist exercise in biological determinism - think ""men are from Mars, women from Venus"" levels of bad parading as so-called equality.  It revolves around the idea that men and women are in some ways fundamentally different and uses stereotypes as examples.  They literally included the well-debunked ""female brain at rest"" vs ""male brain at rest"" CT scans in the presentation.  The talks and information presented was so bad that it literally led to people saying things like ""so that's why my husband never listens!  Hahaha men!"" and ""see I told you women never make any sense!"".  



They presented a made-up and exaggerated example of a bell curve difference in men and women, and I don't even know how to being yelling that There Is No Single Bell Curve For Who You Are!  If you get tested for spacial awareness, visual tendencies and all the other things we bell-curve by gender you may trend in a certain direction in some of them but chances are if you average out all of them you may well end up more vaguely defined in the middle damnit!  We don't know!  And we still don't have a conclusive nature vs nurture answer on any of this!  To say nothing of Gender not being the same bloody thing as sex!


 
At first I thought it was just going to be like what most employers do around these sort of times - a bunch of talks and presentations about how We Value Inclusivity followed by business-as-usual.  So I ignored it.  But now it seems like this is something that people in my office are trying to take forward and to start building ideas around.  
 


I don't know how to explain that their attempt to be Gender Intelligent and inclusive is actually making me feel excluded and unsafe without outing myself.  If this is the direction the company is moving in then being public about my gender identity being constructed mostly from vague hand-wavey gestures and shrugging would probably be an unsafe idea.  Frankly, my RadFem Senses are tingling something fierce.

They\'re trying to be inclusive but they\'re doing it in ways that are the complete opposite!\n\n\n\nAs part of championing diversity, my workplace has begun a so-called Gender Intelligence Initiative.  Frankly, it\'s horrifying.  The entire premise is a gender-essentialist exercise in biological determinism - think ""men are from Mars, women from Venus"" levels of bad parading as so-called equality.  It revolves around the idea that men and women are in some ways fundamentally different and uses stereotypes as examples.  They literally included the well-debunked ""female brain at rest"" vs ""male brain at rest"" CT scans in the presentation.  The talks and information presented was so bad that it literally led to people saying things like ""so that\'s why my husband never listens!  Hahaha men!"" and ""see I told you women never make any sense!"".  \n\n\n\nThey presented a made-up and exaggerated example of a bell curve difference in men and women, and I don\'t even know how to being yelling that There Is No Single Bell Curve For Who You Are!  If you get tested for spacial awareness, visual tendencies and all the other things we bell-curve by gender you may trend in a certain direction in some of them but chances are if you average out all of them you may well end up more vaguely defined in the middle damnit!  We don\'t know!  And we still don\'t have a conclusive nature vs nurture answer on any of this!

So I ignored it.

I'm AFAB and with my friends the last couple of months I've been identifying as a trans guy. But a part of me feels it's much more likely I'm non-binary or agender. Online in certain parts I've actually been identifying as trans-masculine and it's been working for now but I still don't know if it's really that accurate. 

Also, I know that labels don't really matter but I am obsessed and won't be able to settle down until I get an actual idea of what I can call myself, even if it's just in private.

Well... Here are the facts -

* I don't like she/her pronouns. I don't mind they/them pronouns. He/him pronouns are weird but I think I like these most.

* I have friends both male and female (no NB friends that I know of) and I feel a connection to all of them, but when I'm looking at strangers trying to see if I connect more with the guys or with the girl, it's typically neither. Sometimes it's a little more towards the guys but that depends.

* If I HAD to be seen as one or the other, I'd rather be a guy but I would rather just be neither.

* I honestly, truly wish I lived in a genderless world. 

* Some days I feel like I'm definitely non-binary and I'm just fooling myself by sticking to the binary because it would be easier and I have some internalized shit to sort out when I think of non-binary identities.

* I kind of want to identify as agender and say I ""don't have a *specific* gender"" but I know that doesn't really fit the definition all that well.

* When it comes to bathrooms, I very, very heavily prefer gender neutral bathrooms and feel most comfortable there, though I don't hate the women's bathroom and I haven't tried the men's bathroom due to anxiety.

* In a way, I feel like partially every gender and partially none at all, though clearly more male than female. I feel very ""other"" most of the time.

* I get some dysphoria, mostly about my chest, sometimes about my genitals (honestly, my preferred genitals would be the bottom growth on T and nothing else), my name, and mildly about pronouns/being called a girl.

* Sometimes I don't hate my feminine body, but I almost wish it were a costume I could take off most of the time. Which I know is not an option, but it's how I feel.

Well, I think that just about covers it. I'm also in the process of getting a therapist but there's a chance they won't be a gender therapist because I haven't come clean to my parents about my questioning and even still, the process is slow going.

Thanks for being here, by the way.

Thankfully unlike all the gay boys, my spouse still loves me. But it got me thinking about what my orientation is. If she's a girl, then do I like girls? I only ever thought neutral looking girls were cute and only a few of them. So I realized I'm specifically attracted to gender neutral people. That's sitting really well with me.

I think a lot of people who identify as homo or heterosexual have a range they like. My mom likes manly men. My spouse likes neutral to girly. I like neutral as possible.

120,2018-04-12 06:58:58,8bo8oz,8,17,"quick intro: after lurking on /r/nonbinary and /r/genderqueer and /r/genderfluid for a few weeks, I finally created an account. I'm AMAB, polysexual (essentially pan, but excluding cis men and possibly cis women), parent, legal alien in a country that's not my birth country, and I consider myself among the first round of millennials. Many years ago, still in the early stages of my ""awakening"", I became more aware of my non-straightness when my then-girlfriend came out to me, telling me she was not born in a woman's body, and my immediate reaction was ""and?"" and i realized that I'm attracted to her as a person, not a person of a specific gender.

It was around that time that I stumbled upon a kilt store in Seattle. My curiosity drove me in, their sales team was great, and in the end, I left money there, and was so thrilled that i left even more money the next day. My favorite was a version in heather gray, with pleats and four hidden pockets; their most feminine kilt version. Here's a picture of one: http://farm1.staticflickr.com/196/508273770_b1c84ad4c8_o.jpg.

And so began the discovery of my own non-binaryness.

The modern kilt gave me something important: an excuse to wear a skirt in public, including to work. People put it off as a fad, some thought i was a fashion victim. I even got one that matched my suit, so i wouldn't have to wear pants at work functions anymore. A manager at work once told me i should dress more professionally, and i asked him if he said that because of my gender, or because unbiforcated garments are inappropriate (he dropped the matter only after i asked him if we should go to HR together and find out whether they think there's a problem... he didn't want to). In stores, if a kid exclaimed loudly ""this man is wearing a skirt!"" then after the kid's parent corrected (or shushed) them, i could calmly say to the parents: ""your kid is right, though. Technically, a kilt is a kind of skirt."" and fortunately most of them took it with humor or said they liked it or asked where i bought it :)

Eventually, i became more aware that my taste in clothing was not limited to things that are marketed to men. Yet, my anxiety prevented me from deviating more overtly in my presentation. Also, style options were limited: I'm just not that much a fan of floral patterns or glitter, and I didn't want to wear clothing just because it was marketed to women. It also needed to fit me, I needed to like the way it looked on me, and it needed to be comfortable. I also have a few hoodies and t-shirts I like that are purple and/or have some prints that i think are more likely to be worn by women, but nobody ever mentioned anything. Worst that happens is that (usually older) people burst out in laughter in public when they spot the small unicorn on one of my sweaters, and when i turn around to look at them, they apologize and sometimes i can even make very brief small-talk before they skedaddle.

Then i discovered overalls. Sure, they're marketed to men in workwear stores; but it's mostly women wearing them casually (albeit often with extremely short legs or otherwise impractical). But still, bingo: another piece of clothing that i had an excuse to wear. If anything, i may have appeared a bit ""odd"" to others. And heck, they're comfortable! Came summer, though, they got a bit too warm, and i got a bit more daring and decided to hem the legs off one of my denim overalls at knee height. I got a few comments on it, mostly positive, including the most awesome comment of all: After a friend's mum asked me where they sell shortalls for men and i told her i couldn't find any so i had to alter one myself, she said they look ""cute"" on me. Nobody's ever called me that before, and it felt so good! I just never told anyone before how good that comment felt to me at the time...

That said, to go with my legwear, I sport red Dr. Martens, and I think one of my next pairs will be Docs that i so far always wanted to buy but never dared to, because they're listed under ""Womens"".

I can tell that I am slowly beginning to stop caring what other people think, and to assert myself (thanks again to my therapist for helping me work through those anxieties). If someone says to me that it's odd for a man to wear XYZ, I simply ask them: ""why's that?"" and then watch them realize their own bias. Or if someone says ""they're woman's pants, because the zipper fly opens on the wrong side"" i reply ""really? why... what does the side of the fly have to do with gender?"". All of those conversations have gone well so far, even in other western countries I've visited. The worst comment i got was at a train station in Germany when an older person commented: ""You're quite a colorful bird, aren't you?"" but it was a rhetorical question and i'm not quite sure what to make of it.

But despite my ""progress"", I find myself looking for more options that I can use to push the boundaries of my presentation without risking too much.

So far I have: Kilts, Overalls, Shortalls, colorful shoes. Does anyone have other suggestions for what I could add, that fall into this low-risk boundary-pushing category?

TL;DR: Some people think that gender-neutral clothing for AFAB people would mean a hoodie and saggy pants, my search for the needle in a haystack is something like that but in reverse. Something that's more feminine, but on the careful side of things. Something that would offer me an ""excuse"" if i really needed one to defend against assholes. I couldn't find any similar posts (maybe i was looking in the wrong subreddits?)

I'm new here and I'm still trying to figure out how I want to present in public.

I recalled a memory the other day that I think is very relevant.  I was out shopping, and it crossed my mind that I wanted to buy some protein powder, and I just so happened to walk past a shop that sells body-building supplements, and so I walked in and asked which product I might like.

The gentleman running the shop was dressed a bit oddly.  He had an unusual hairstyle, and I recall that he was wearing four rings in each ear.  I would say that he looked as if he just stepped off the set of a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie.  He confidently told me which product he recommended, and while I made my selection, I watched him confidently banter with several other customers.

The thing I recall about him was that his presentation was very unusual.  You could say that he was peacocking with his earrings and hairstyle, and yet he presented himself in a manner that he was completely confident in the way he had adorned himself.  There was not the least trace of any fear of what anyone would make of his appearance.  This was a man who was completely comfortable in his own skin, or at least if he wasn't, he was good at pretending.

When I go outside of my house, I feel compelled to wear mid-to-heavyweight fabrics (hoodies, sweaters) simply to provide ""cover"" to my nipples, which are distinctly femme: if I wear lightweight fabrics, you can see the contours of my nipples very well, and if the fabric is light in color, you can make out the darker skin pigment too. I wish I didn't have worries about this but I do.

Once I decided to wear a light colored t-shirt out, only to have someone yell at me to put a bra on. She actually yelled. In my face. Angrily. Because I was wearing a t-shirt? ""Put a fucking bra on!"" (actual quote). I felt a wave of shame and embarrassment wash over me and put on my hoodie.

I want to be strong about this. I know that there's NOTHING wrong with what I'm doing but I still feel like I have to alter my behavior for the sake of the people who think I'm doing something wrong.

I feel like there's a very good chance I get called into Human Resources if I wear a t-shirt. In public, I feel vulnerable to interactions like the one I mentioned.

This study will help us better understand how eating disorder symptomatology and body image dissatisfaction differ between LGBTQ+ and heteronormative populations, in order to best support these populations. This study has been approved by the Pacific University Institutional Review Board (#166-17).
You are invited to participate if you: 1) Are 18 years of age or older 2) English literate 3) Identify as at least one of the following: a. Cisgender b. Transgender c. LGBQ+ d. Heterosexual

Quite a short and quick question. I've been identifying more and more as non-binary genderfluid recently, oscillating mainly between feeling ""almost masculine"" and feeling ""almost feminine"", with a little middle ground. I'm AMAB, so on the days I feel more masculine I'm generally quite okay with having a male body, and presenting as a male, but on the days where I clearly feel feminine I can get really dysphoric, it can be quite intense. It's got me thinking recently about HRT, but those days where I feel more masculine throw me off because I'm sort of scared of a ""what if I then get dysphoric over the secondary characteristics I made happen myself through HRT?"".
So my question is just this: any non-binary people who have been on HRT, has it ever happened that you feel dysphoric over your newly developed secondary characteristics when maybe you feel more aligned with the gender you were assigned at birth?

I'm afab bi-gender (girl and guy) and have been on T for nearly a year. I love the changes I'm get getting, mostly. By some miracle my speaking voice hasn't changed - one of two things I didn't want out of HRT (the other being hair changes). I want to physically be a guy (I have scheduled top surgery and have consult this fall for meta) but I want to be seen as a girl (yes I plan to get breast forms the same size as my current natural boobs). 

However, when on a full guy swing, I want more. I want to let my beard grow, cut my hair (I currently have a unisex cut), be a guy totally. But I still don't want my (liberal, mostly accepting) community to see me as a guy. I love my silk skirts, my earrings, my femme image. It makes me feel somehow powerful, being a girl on the surface. Powerful like Wonder Woman or Xena (two of the female figure types I aspire to). I don't want to give up these things.

But recently I dressed full masc to visit a support group in another city.  While it didn't have that same feeling of empowerment as dressing full femme, I felt amazingly comfortable in my skin in a completely different way. I was able to simply relax into being a guy. At one point I actually had to think  to remember my girl name, which has *never* happened to me before.

I was AFAB and she/her pronouns have always been fine, but I’m pretty androgynous. I frequently get mistaken for a male, which doesn’t bother me, but I also get referred to by he/him pronouns and it made me really uncomfortable. I know how odd that sounds. 

I’ve never expressed myself in a feminine way, nor have I ever really been interested in doing so. I’ll wear a dress from time to time, but I don’t enjoy it. 

I even kind of like it when people can’t tell if I’m male or female. Is that weird?

There is one thing that’s getting me though - I don’t like labels. There’s only one label I can’t get away from and that’s disabled. I have 2 disabilities and I’ve accepted them as part of my identity, but for some reason, being labelled as non-binary doesn’t feel right...

I still have a lot to learn, but right now, I don’t even know what questions to ask. I hope this post made some kind of sense to someone.

I used to use yoga classes as an excuse to wear them.  The male anatomy gets in the way, but now that I identify as enby, I feel like I have the right to tuck the equipment out of the way.

I've heard people complain that women who wear leggings are being immodest and ""showing off"".  Maybe they are, but who cares when you can wear such a comfortable garment!

So, besides being part of my enby presentation, what do I love about leggings so much?

They cover my legs without the discomfort I associate with other types of pants.

Especially when they don't have a waistband, they just fit like a second skin around my waist.  I can't tell you how much I *do not miss* having a belt tightly pinching the waist of my pants against my skin and seeing the red band that it leaves on my skin that I had taken for granted for decades.

Ever sit for a long car/train/plane ride and squirm uncomfortably in your seat as your belt rubs the top of your pants against your skin?  Not with leggings, you don't!

Oh yes, and I also do not miss wearing jeans that snag and pull at my joints as I move about.

221,2018-04-20 10:44:30,8dmmsr,1,19,"My wife and I attended the Blackheart Burlesque last night, hosted by the Suicide Girls. It was a sexy, funny, creative good time overall, but there was also a very uplifting moment.

Near the end of the show, the host invited any and all women in the audience to the stage, for a sexy dance-off competition. 

The only rule? There are no rules.

Probably twenty or so attractive women made their way to the stage. In that group was someone clearly going for an androgynous look. I dare say they were non binary. No hips, masculine clothes and haircut.  Very skinny. Androgynous large glasses. Flat chest. The only vague hint about their identified gender was the fact that they were on stage, specifically at the invitation for women only. 

The dancing lasted for a couple minutes. Everyone had a gimmick to try and win the dance competition. A couple girls started making out. Many others stripped down to their panties with huge exaggerated movements - it was that kind of show.

Not this non binary person, though; she/they just swayed slowly, kind of shyly. They undid the clasp and zipper of their pants, and lowered them slightly, revealing completely masculine boxer-briefs. They lowered the underwear just low enough to *not* reveal any hints about their genitals.

I still couldn't tell you what their 'assigned' gender was. Not that it mattered. 

In the end, the winner was selected by audience reactions and applause. I'll cut to the chase; the audience *loved* our non binary friend. They won in a landslide. 

That felt really uplifting. That a huge, mixed crowd full of people - who all came to see a bunch of strip teases from beautiful women with bouncing breasts - recognized the modern beauty of this androgynous audience member, really made my night.

I searched the subreddit and couldn't find any similar enough answers, so I hope it's okay that I ask this.

Like the title says, I noticed last night that my AFAB sibling changed their Facebook pronouns to they/them. I want to do my best to be a supportive brother, but this came as a bit of a surprise to me. I've referred to them as sister (she/her) my entire life (I'm in my 20s) - I understand that much of this subreddit goes through the trouble of dealing with family and I don't want to cause my sibling any more distress than they might be going through already.

Should I approach them about this? I understand that they should approach me on their own time and that I shouldn't force this upon them. At the same time, I don't want to misgender them when speaking to others. This is a conversation I would rather have in person, but we live 7,000 miles apart from each other and that really isn't feasible for the next few months. When we last saw each other 2 months ago, they were still using she/her pronouns to the best of my knowledge.

Some more background on our relationship, they identified as not straight before changing FB pronouns and came out to me before to our parents. We enjoy a healthy relationship; not constant contact but we very much care for each other as family and friends. 

So asking NB people who have experiences with siblings, how would you have wanted them to respond after coming out? I expect answers to vary across the board, I'm looking for at least some direction.

A few weeks ago, they came out as non-binary online and expressed interest in switching to they/them pronouns. I called them and we had a really good conversation. I asked if being a ""bridesmaid"" would make them uncomfortable and they said no and that they are fine with wearing a dress, just not wearing makeup or shaving their legs. This is all good with me. I also added that if they'd prefer to wear a button-up shirt in the same color as the dresses, that would be great too.

251,2018-04-22 21:02:14,8e66rh,6,4,"I'm just going to put this in a list to help myself out. 

1. I know for a fact I'm trans and have dysphoria(even if half the time I'm doubting whether I'm inventing it or not because my chest/bottom dysphoria didn't begin afaik until I realized I was trans but I had other signs of dyshphoria) 

2. I know I'm not at all a woman even if it took steps to pull away from that. First I id'd as bigender(woman and demiboy/boy) then androgyne(still a mix of boy and girl), neutrois, and finally agender(though I’m trying to figure out if agenderflux/agender+male or whatever the mess is more appropriate). 

3. The problem now is I can't tell if I still don't want to let go of what's familiar to me and say I'm completely binary trans man and I'm inventing my dysphoria about not wanting phallo because the penis would be too large(although I still don't want it for various other reasons) and inventing it about other things. 

4. The problem is that I also have dysphoria about basically everything with this body pre-t. I absolutely know for sure I want t, top surgery, meta w/possible scrotoplasty and the works, but I have such a bad opinion of he/him pronouns, being seen as a man(though I would take them in public to be comfortable because I know I want facial hair etc, it would hurt me if someone who knew I really wasn't a man to use he/him) etc. 

5. I know I love women and I've known since I was 12/13, been using the bi label since I was around 14(originally came out as a lesbian). The problem is that if I'm a dude, I know I'm not attracted to men/people who are leaning toward that and that I'm exclusively attracted to women and other non-men, which, in my mind only, means that I can't be bi and would be a straight man, which I just can't take, personally. I also don’t want my attraction to women to have to change, or know that, as a person seen as a man, I would feel like I can’t enjoy the wlw ships I have for a very long time and found an immense amount of identity in(Marceline/Princess Bubblegum from Adventure Time, basically all of my ships from Degrassi, ships from The 100, etc, etc) Along with this, I'm scared of cis straight women thinking I'm a man and being into me/wanting me to perform in a way a cis guy interested in women would, and similarly scared of not attracting bi women who are interested in nonbinary people as a nonbinary person.

6. This is just an internalized racism thing and I'm fully aware but I don't want to be a black man. I don't have anything in common with the universal black man experience, mostly because, while it's stereotypical and I know all black men aren't like this, I'm not interested in collecting Jordan's and doing all of that other stuff. Which I know doesn't make anyone a man but in my mind it does, and I don't do those things. I feel like if I was white I wouldn't worry about this part nearly as much for obvious reasons, but I don't want to walk around this world being seen as a black man(which, again I really want facial hair so I would deal with it but it would be severely uncomfortable especially for dating). 

My real thing is that I just want to be me, but with all the 'nonbinary people aren't real/nonbinary people are cis' stuff it's super invalidating and I've literally spent every day for the past month or so probably thinking 'am I really just a trans guy/the best I could qualify is nonbinary trans guy I could never call myself a man/ I like being called a gentleman/handsome etc and I like taking a masculine role in relationships blah blah blah but I can’t just take the final leap'. I just feel like I want to be a man in everything but name/brain wise, if that makes any sense, like I want to ‘look like a man’ but can’t handle people treating me like one.  

I just want to be able to let this go and focus on being on t etc but it’s gonna be a whole nother year before I can move and start since I’m in college rn with no options. So until then I’ll have to waffle back and forth. 
Edit: Wow okay this is even longer than I thought in reddit format, reformatted.

TL;DR: I want to be a man in everything but name but I'm afraid that that's just me being afraid of being a straight black man, that I won't be myself anymore and won't be attractive/will be attractive to people assuming I'm cis/a binary man.

253,2018-04-22 21:25:21,8e6c59,5,20,"I started T October 2017 and wanted to stop exactly one year on it, as I'd had the changes that I personally needed from hormones. My face and body were perfectly androgynous and I hardly had any facial hair to speak of.

I remembered thinking that facial hair would be this super validating thing for me to have before starting T. I never actually had much chest dysphoria but felt this pressure to bind even though I never really minded my chest. Presently, I quite like it and if I'm being perfectly frank, it sometimes gives me gender euphoria when I'm having a good boob day.

I tried briefly to stop hormones and to express my gender in a more traditionally feminine way, only to feel ostracized by the trans students on my campus and later much of the under 25 LGBT community online. Funny how the internet loves ""softbois,"" or femme trans men, yet finds ways to make genderfluidity problematic.

Those who expressed disapproval were accusing me of enjoying feminine expression as just a sexual kink, which is funny considering that when I'm expressing my masculinity, I wear the tightest skinny jeans I can fit myself into while packing and wear low v neck t shirts to show off my chest hair. I'm a highly sexual person regardless and I express it when I'm feeling it.

Fast forward to now, my body hair has become so thick that it almost isn't human in comparison to cis men. It's so thick that if I leave it alone, it gets caught in my clothes and gets ripped out. If I shave it, it's even worse because the stubble is coarse enough to scrape others if they accidentally run their hands over it.

At this point I'm pursuing laser hair removal just to thin the hair out, not even remove it. Yet because of this, the fact that I've stopped testosterone and have no intention of having top surgery, any trans person I've talked to about this who's my age (24) or younger thinks I'm detransitioning.

But the reality is that my medical transition has only begun.

If I had to succinctly explain my gender identity to someone, I would use Baphomet as an example. I'm a total gym rat and I love the muscle mass that T has afforded me but I also love my breasts and sometimes question whether having them bigger would increase my gender euphoria. I miss my curves; I used to have some nice hips and a round butt but T has made them vanish. I'm planning to have metoidioplasty upon exiting the adult industry, where I present as a binary woman. (Not because I need to, I want to make that quite clear.)

I'm open to going on T again in the future. But my main source of frustration at this point is feeling so misunderstood by the community. Others have regarded me as confused or have made harsh remarks about people who detransition, which isn't fair to people who do choose that.

Any time I've tried to talk to someone under 25 about this, I'm always hit with this social justice lecture about how gender is just a social construct and how it's problematic to label primary or secondary sexual characteristics, clothing, makeup, hair, body language, whatever, as masculine or feminine. Give me a break. If those things really were meaningless, then nobody would transition.

267,2018-04-23 23:58:05,8eg5oq,13,25,"Hi everyone! I’m an AFAB non-binary, genderqueer person. I have an appointment on Friday to talk about going on a “low dose” of testosterone. Does anybody else have any experience with this? Some notes about my reasoning and knowledge about it -

• I know that I can’t “pick and choose” what effects I’m going to get, and I’m not trying to
• I know the effects of testosterone will eventually level off at some point, they aren’t permanently cumulative (you don’t see cis men, for example, constantly being more masculinized after puberty due to the natural testosterone levels in their systems)
• I know testosterone is a stronger hormone than estrogen, effects-wise
• I know everyone has different androgen sensitivity levels

My boyfriend is a trans man and he is taking 50mg of T every week, so I have a pretty good firsthand idea of what the effects are, though I know it varies for everyone. I think I’d like to start at 25mg a week and adjust the dosage if needed, depending on how quickly things go, how I feel, etc.

Basically, I want to try and “level out” my appearance, voice, hair, etc. to be more balanced between the effects of estrogen and testosterone. I know it won’t be completely even or anything. I want to be more ambiguous. I feel like it will help me not only physically and socially, but mentally as well. Ideally, my end goal would be for me to find he right dosage to where I could be forever gender-ambiguous in that way, and be able to play up or down my masculinity or femininity depending on how I feel.

I on HRT only estrogen patches (Estradot 25) from 2 months. No AA.

Do you think I should increase my dose (Estradot 50 instead of 25)?

303,2018-04-28 05:08:20,8fhtdg,6,43,"Hello, late Generation X here. I used to identify as male and am typically read as such. About a 1-1/2 years ago, I ran into a dear friend who used the word ""non-binary"" when telling me about the team at her workplace. She said ""non-binary"" in such a casual context, like any other word, that there was not a good opportunity for me to ask what it meant. But I googled the heck out of it later. 

I was more focused on figuring out what ""non-binary"" meant, that i missed the invitation to explore what ""feeling not bound to the gender binary"" could mean to me. Fortunately, several months later, I encountered the gender unicorn, and with no pre-defined sliders, I wanted to fill it out and see where i could see myself on the spectrum. It helped me break out of the binary thinking pattern, allowing me to see myself more wholly, and it felt very liberating. I realized I have never shied away from doing things that some consider girl/women interests"", and don't like to conform to others' expectations, including presentation, and i openly refuse to participate in some ""male"" associated behaviors and activities. So i realized that nothing really had to change, even though i found an explanation, a new perspective, and a motivation to go be myself more, and be more comfortable being myself.

Yesterday during a work meeting with my immediate team, a diversity subject came up with a subtle hint to non-binary gender identities, followed by a gender distribution example that mentioned ""20% males"". My team responded ""80% women? How's that equal?"" and without taking a pause to think clearly, i said ""That's not how this works."" My entire team looked at me, waiting for an explanation, so I continued: ""I mean, it's 2018, is the gender binary really still so important?"". It seemed like my team thought i made a joke, maybe one that they didn't get. Their reaction wasn't threatening or disrespectful, more like baffled or confused. Only one coworker looked at me funny, as if he had already suspected. I saw that my entire team would continue to be blind to the gender non-binary if i didn't take another stab at getting an explanation across. And i thought the best way was to reveal to them that they know someone who is nobinary, and it's OK. I explained: ""I felt it important to mention, because i'm part of the 80% in the example that was brought up. I'm non-binary. It's nothing new, there's just usually no need to tell people about it.""

I gave no further explanation, and nobody asked a question (not that i expected any). They all continued to treat me the same way as far as I can tell, probably  because we all get along well and they already noticed that i'm not conforming to cis gender norms, even if they didn't have a good label for that. 

At the end of the day today, one of my colleagues came to me and confessed: ""You know, after you told me what you told me yesterday, i went to my spouse and asked her if she knew what nonbinary meant, because i didn't. Usually, she knows such things, but she didn't know either. So i googled it. An hour later, she asked me if I had figured it out and i had to tell her that I've been reading stuff on the internet about it for an hour, that i have a bit of an idea of what it might mean, but i'm still not entirely sure."" - I told him that this is what it feels like to me sometimes, too, and he replied ""I believe it."" ;-)

TLDR: when my team misunderstood a diversity-related subject that hinted at non-binary gender identification, i tried to clarify but the team misunderstood again. I felt an obligation to end non-binary invisibility for them, and found the best way was to reveal myself as non-binary, without big explanation, figuring they'd either ask or google it.

I'm pronoun indifferent (or maybe I'm not?). I just don't really connect pronouns with gender in my head, they don't make me feel any different.

I'm afab, so usually people use she/her. I look quite androgynous so recently it happened quite a lot that people misgendered me as male and also used he/him.
It made me feel great. I don't want to be male, but just someone using different pronouns than I'm used to felt amazing :D I guess a rush of gender euphoria, idk...
I use they/them only online because in my mother tongue it is a little bit more complicated with the gender neutral pronouns, although they do exist. 
I'm not sure I like they/them better than she or he but I just feel like it fits better? Like it doesn't make me feel any different (or the same way he makes me feel), but I just like that it's out of the binary and not forcing gender (expectations) on me.
At the same time I'm thinking that it's far too complicated asking everybody to use pronouns that no one has ever heard of out of lgbtq+ circles and if it's really that important to me?

i'm just wondering whether anybody else feels that way. Wondering if I'm even pronoun indifferent haha why would I use other pronouns than those of my assigned gender at birth when I don't really care anyways?

13,2018-04-03 06:08:57,89ajvt,1,1,"So at the beginning of December last year I got on hormones (2mg estrogen + 100mg spiro 2x a day). I had pretty much zero negative side effects after the first few weeks and I was very happy with the results I was seeing (Way less hair growth and it lightened up a lot, more female body shape and breast development). I went in for blood work around the 20th of February, had a follow up appointment 2 weeks later to go over it. 

They didn't call me or anything before this even though they had the results and claimed my testosterone was at 1 and my Estrogen was at 800 when they went over my blood work. The doctor accused me of overdosing even though I had been taking it exactly as prescribed and I had even missed doses a few times. After that appointment they cut my dosages in half and switched me from 90 days of meds to 30 days about a month ago. I was fine with that but a little weary of the results as I had been feeling great and really happy with the results over 3 months and I was finally able to get a job again after being unemployed for 8 months.

Note: Pre HRT I had perfectly normal hormone levels for a male. I was 20 at the start of HRT and recently turned 21.

So forward to a month later and almost all the positive effects have reversed to near pre HRT while being on 1mg estrogen + 50mg spiro 2x a day. I have also developed an eating disorder, insomnia, hot/cold flashes, headaches, severe mood swings and extremely bad depression which all mixed together caused me to lose my job about a week ago.

My HRT doctor's office refused to test my blood now and said I had to wait till next week for an appointment with my doctor there to go over my issues. So I will be going to my primary care doctor tomorrow and hopefully be able to get a hormone test from a different lab. I was able to get a copy of both my pre hrt and 3 month HRT blood work test and archive it with my primary doctor so there is records of it in more than one location.

Has anyone else had similar experiences with blood test? Because I am extremely skeptical that I actually went from normal Testosterone and estrogen levels to 1 testerone and 800 estrogen in 3 months on a pretty moderate dose. Should I look into legal help if I get blood test elsewhere and they don't match up as this has severely impacted my life.

Note: I am going to hopefully be switching HRT doctors soon. Unfortunately I live in Oklahoma so barely any exist here and having to wait 3 months between normal appointments is ridiculous.

tl;dr:

43,2018-04-08 10:01:35,8ap27j,8,16,"Hey y'all. First off, thanks for being beautiful. You've already helped me figure out a lot.

Maybe a little too much, too fast. Start to finish I've certainly taken my time considering this - my first inkling that I may be trans was winter '16/17 but my dumb ass never thought to look for trans subreddits until a month or two ago, and all doubt was removed from my mind VERY quickly. I'm also a very vocal proponent of being a very vocal proponent, and am fortunate enough to live in a liberal state with leftist friends, so I came out the moment I was certain. Even at work, they're calling me by my name despite being (almost) pre-everything. I haven't gotten anything but support from the people I know irl and it's been amazing seeing the outpouring of love, but that makes me feel so much weaker for crying away the weekend while browsing reddit and facebook looking for anyone to talk to long enough to distract me from my perpetual breakdown.

I feel like I've been working through 30 years worth of unbearable emotions in a single month. All the doubt, the fear, the torture I put myself through trying to live like this. All the hatred for my own younger self for putting this aside, for failing to see what's now so obvious, for not taking the opportunity when I had a better job with better insurance and more free time and was still living with my family, all of whom would have supported me just as strongly as they are now but from down the hall, not across the city. When I was young enough for more to happen, and faster, and better. When I was young enough to take advantage of the clarity and serenity that I've only ever been able to grasp for brief moments of drug-fueled dissociation before this past month. I know regretting it isn't going to change it, and I know there's an astonishing number of wonderful people who only figured it out when they were twice my age, but I can't help feeling awful and I don't know how to move on.

I'm terrified of what's to come. Even putting aside the risk of social ostracization (my job is very community-oriented, at that), the risk of hateful people destroying my body (which has happened to a family friend, even here in liberal country), the risk of medical complications, the risk of financial disaster (I was scraping by before I started looking into treatment), nothing in life has ever demanded so much sheer effort or commitment. I've never cared about anything like this transition, and the idea of actually having to work for something for the first time makes me wonder whether I even have the fortitude to do so. I care enough to put in the work...I think? I care enough that not knowing whether I do is crushing.

Feeling anything at all is terrifying me. None of my self-abuse ever felt wrong or worth changing because I couldn't imagine a life worth living, but now that the door is open I'm actually hearing the insults I hurl at myself, and they actually hurt. I'm looking at my yellow-ass teeth that were never worth taking care of, and my bones that are creaking before their time. I'm looking at my empty savings, and looking back at the years of drugs and alcohol that burned through the money I could have put toward school or surgery or fucking anything that would have lasted. I can't stand what I've let myself become for the ignorance of what I could become, and it feels like the mistakes I've already made have ruined my potential.

Even now that I'm finally doing electrolysis and vocal training and going to see a doctor about some skittles later this week, I'm just crushed by the injustice of being born this way. Life shouldn't have to be so goddamn hard, and as sure as I am that things are gonna get better and easier, and as patient as I know I need to be, and even though I know I'm doing everything right and I have everything going for me, I just want to hit the ground at mach 4 and be done ten years ago like I fucking could have.

I'm a 16 year old male, and I've had feelings similar to that of trans people for several years. I've posted one other time on here saying that I was having thoughts, and the people who offered advice said that I should try to experience more femininity; corssdressing, doing makeup, going by female pronouns.

I'm all for it, but the problem is that I don't really have the means to do any of that. I'm clueless when it comes to really anything. I think it could be worth it to come out to my mom, because then I wouldn't have to try to be secretive, and could actually buy things online.

Just recently, I've gotten a huge wave of confidence, and I want to come out real soon.

Is there any tips for coming out? I may be confident about myself alone, but I can easily see myself mussing up in my attempt to come out. Or is doing it over text okay? Because I would prefer that much more.

What's the best way to say it? So far, the best I can describe it is like ""I think I might be transgender."" I want to ask for her help, but I also want to be sensitive about her views on this.

If it helps, I she hasn't shown any strong feelings to transgender people. What she says is ""well, they can do what they want to do. It doesn't impact me in any way.""

Here is what I did.  

I bought into the narrative that Trans people will flip at you for using the wrong gender pronoun.  

The reason I bought into this narrative; was because of one single experience that I had with a trans person who got angry at me for mistaking their gender and publicly shamed me, in front of A LOT of people.  

It was very embarrassing for me.  I walked away thinking differently.  I walked away thinking most trans must be like that, and didn’t look into it further because I was angry for being treated that way.   (I did this, despite even knowing a trans person who is an acquaintance of mine, and I know that they would NEVER flip at anyone.)  

THAT, was wrong of me.  THAT, was FLAWED LOGIC.

Then, tonight, I made a post giving my erroneous opinions based on that narrative, without even thinking about the emotional effects it might have .  It seems stupid, but it’s very easy to buy into a narrative about any group of people and I did it to this group.

So, I’d like to let you know that I’ll be looking into Trans culture and learning more about it from this subreddit to help prevent me from doing something like that again.  

I am a cis-gendered white male, and I am looking forward to learning more about your culture and how to be respectful of it.  I hope that whatever struggles you face as a Trans person today, will be easier on you.  I would be more specific, but without being a trans person myself; I can’t truly claim to know what those struggles are.  It would be a fake gesture.  I can, wish you good luck with them and try to be supportive, though.

Go get ‘em, live your life and please don’t pay attention to the hateful and closed minded.  I support your freedom to live as you feel and to find your identity and I hope that the next trans person I meet I can make smile, instead of feel more hurt.

I am currently running a consultation period for my website https://transgirlsays.mn.co/

I am looking for ideas on how to move forward and create meaningful content for a global transgender community as well as new team members to head up different initiatives on the network.

We are a multimedia platform designed to bring news, lifestyle content and transition advice to the community, as well as connect people with their local community and people in a similar situation.

I need contributors for TransGuySays (a project that is yet to find a home, but will do soon). I also need consultation for how to integrate the non-binary area of the network.

I also want to make a home for family members of trans people, a home for support groups to liaise with each other and special channels for community project and groups.

The company is not for profit (unregistered at the moment), but has a very socially conscious financial set up.

If you have any skills or interest in helping develop this community, please let me know. Either here, via private message or come and find me at https://transgirlsays.mn.co/

Many thanks

I've been questioning if I'm trans (ftm) for about a year now, and within the past couple weeks it seems like everything's crashing down. Basically, I need advice on how to move forward because I feel really stuck. I don't know if I'm faking what I'm feeling or if it's actually real.


I think everything started way back to when I started middle school. Since everyone in my grade had just moved into a new school, I decided to go along with what every other girl was doing and make myself really feminine and ""grown-up"", ignoring how much I absolutely hating how I looked in makeup and earrings and feminine clothes. This didn't last for long: I ended 8th grade wearing big t-shirts and jeans, and with debilitating social anxiety and depression. Fun! 


Going into high school, for some reason I really really wanted to cut my hair short. I'd seen pictures of afab people with short haircuts on tumblr and really identified with it. Once the idea was in my mind, I really thought it would help my social anxiety even though I didn't know why. Sadly, my mother would only let me get it cut shoulder length and ""maybe get it cut shorter later in stages"". 
sidenote: Now almost 18, I FINALLY have the haircut I wanted at age 13.


I started, almost obsessively, watching trans guys on youtube about halfway through high school (I'm a senior now), and found myself really connecting to them. Hearing their experiences made me wonder if the social disconnect and discomfort I had been feeling since I was about 12 had anything to do with gender identity, even though I had never thought of myself as being uncomfortable with my body.


Fast forward to about a year ago, I started to really dislike my chest. I would wear a jacket no matter how hot it got just to hide it. Again, I found solace in obsessively watching trans youtubers almost daily (I haven't stopped since lol), and as spring turned into summer and my depression worsened, that was pretty much the only thing I did. I found a way to flatten my chest using a camisole with elastic, and for the first time since getting my hair cut shorter I felt more confident in myself and my body (but also more anxious about hurting my ribs and about what I was feeling meant). This was when I started to question if I was a trans guy, or maybe nonbinary. I was positive I felt a disconnect from the terms ""girl"", ""woman"", etc.


As this new school year started, I absolutely hated myself. My mother forced me to wear makeup and clothes I was uncomfortable in for ""senior portraits"" despite my protests. I spent three hours at a photoshoot literally wanting to die from anxiety and discomfort at my body and appearance. Meanwhile, my depression was getting worse and worse, and questioning my gender identity was making everything harder. I really wanted to start dressing more masculinely but I was terrified to. Eventually, I found the confidence to buy a couple things from the mens section even with my mother disgusted at me for doing so, and bought some things from thrift stores to try out. With new clothes, a flatter chest, and finally getting the haircut I wanted, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT MYSELF AND SO MUCH MORE CONFIDENT IT'S CRAZY! :D


However, with all these new aesthetic changes I still don't really know how I feel about my gender identity. I REALLY don't think of myself as a ""girl"", and I'm surprised and uncomfortable when I realize people see me as one. I also realized recently that I'm So! Incredibly! JEALOUS! of cis guys, and I think I always have been even though I didn't connect the dots until now. I really wish I had a masculine chest and height and VOICE and mannerisms etc. I've been feeling more and more disconnected with my name and she/her pronouns too.


But at the same time I'm worried constantly if I'm faking all of these feelings and just.... I don't know. I'm always unsure of everything. I don't know how I'd feel with he/him pronouns or a new name. I'm just terrified and don't know what to think. I don't know if I'm trans, or non binary, or just stupid. I can't talk to anyone about this either, which really sucks. In general I'm just extremely terrified and unsure of the future and I don't know what to do next.

I would throw a fit if I had to wear a women's sweater. I didn't have all that much body dysphoria, but I hated it when I didn't pass as male. Having long hair made me want to crawl under a rock and never leave. I got my hair cut and feel a lot better.

But about a year ago I began to embrace my femininity. It's probably because I began to pass, and didn't feel like I had to constantly prove myself to be a guy anymore. Accepting my bisexuality played a part too, because before then, I was in a lot of denial. I went from not wanting anything to do with femininity and wearing the same ugly sweatshirt and baggy jeans each day, to being extremely feminine and putting way too much thought into my wardrobe so quickly. I don't mind wearing certain articles of women's clothing if I like it. I've found some awesome things in the women's section. As long as it doesn't prevent me from passing, I'll buy it. Sometimes my body will look really feminine, and I don't feel like I have a problem with it. Sometimes I'll look really feminine, but think I look good. My hips will be large, my chest won't be flat, but I don't feel much discomfort about it. But it still feels wrong when people refer to me as female. I now barely feel very dysphoric, even when I have plenty of reason to. My chest is no longer flat, my face is way more feminine, and sadly, I don't pass as often as I used to. I used to be able to wear a fucking women's swimsuit and people would still perceive me as male. Yeah, it was a swim shirt and board shorts, but it was still obviously women's swimwear. But now I can't pass often. And I don't really feel that bad about it. Sometimes it gets me down, but I guess I just don't think about it much.

Now I'm having doubts about being trans. I went through the same thing last year. I'm just scared of the idea of growing out of this. I've fought so hard to be accepted, and it would suck so bad if this all ended up being a phase. Being ftm has definitely become a part of my identity, and I don't want to lose that. Sometimes I get nervous about the idea of medical transition. I don't want to be a big hairy guy (no offense to you big hairy guys out there). I don't want a super deep voice. I'd rather I had a voice that was kind of high pitched, but still distinguishable as male. Today I took a bunch of selfies, and I was passing really well. But for some reason it felt weird. I looked really masculine, and for some reason I didn't really like that? Idk. At least I looked photogenic in those selfies for once lol. I feel comfortable as the boy I am now, but I'm not sure how I feel about the idea of being a man. Lately the doubt has been getting a lot worse. I'm just really scared of possibly growing out of this. Being male has been a large part of my identity for my whole life, even before I realized I was trans. I just really don't want to lose that. I know it would be a lot easier just being a cis girl, but I'll feel like I've lost a huge part of my identity. But I don't want to go right on hormones and then end up regretting it later.

So I realized that our Discord server, Transgender Talk, has been slow lately because we don't advertise it anywhere. The only place people can get to it is through our Chatzy page because that's where Transgender Talk started. Thus, I am here to advertise our server! Here is the link: 

https://discord.gg/ck76Ap5

If I had to describe the server, I'd say it's pretty chill in comparison to some trans servers I've joined. We have more tolerance for divisive discourse, and I don't feel we police or try to stop discussions, though we do try to remain respectful and attentive to the needs of others. I have a ton of appreciation for this aspect of our server because I feel that openness plays a crucial role in constructing safe spaces.  Some rules, such as keeping adult content in the adult channel or keeping sensitive discussions in support, are definitely necessary and should be enforced.  However, an overreliance on rules can prevent potentially constructive conversations from occurring. It is difficult for people to practice freedom of expression when they fear scrutiny or when they are expected to remember a long list of topics that require trigger warnings or must follow a set of highly specific instructions just to communicate on a server.  At a certain point, these dynamics seem to prioritize arbitrary discipline over actual empathy toward other people.  My personal belief is that it is far better to participate in an ongoing dialogue about these types of issues as they arise so that everyone can learn how to support one another more effectively and can practice being more conscientious of words that might harm others (a.k.a. call-in vs. call-out culture).  For these reasons, I feel extremely comfortable on this server and view it as a positive place.  I would also say that our server attracts a mostly 18+ crowd, as our youth members tend to spend more time on Chatzy.

Anyway, thanks for your time, and I look forward to seeing new virtual faces soon :)

104,2018-04-16 22:10:19,8crigs,5,12,"So for the last month or so, I've really been lost on how I identify. I'm AFAB, but something about that never felt quite right. I always knew I was different from the girls I was made to be around, but I could never figure out just what it was. I was always my happiest around boys, in school, with my cousins, etc., but Around 4th or 5th grade I was getting bullied for being ""not like other girls,"" and I dedicated pretty much the rest of my life to trying to be as girly and feminine as I possibly could be. I alienated myself from everything related to boys and masculinity. 

Fast forward, I'm a freshman in college. I've since made friends with people from all walks of life, reconnected with my guy friends from my past, whatever. 

I'm starting to question my identity, though. I've always felt uncomfortable with my body, and I realize that now. A sort of repressed memory resurfaced not too long ago, I was a little kid and just having an absolute panic attack about how I was getting breasts and how horrified I was at having to wear a bra and ""start being a woman."" It felt so wrong. It still does. I always just wrote that off as ""puberty is weird for everyone, right?"" but that memory, along with so many others, are all starting to set off red flags and ""clicks"" in my head that something's been different all along.

I had trans friends before, I just never thought to apply it to myself because I was still trying so hard to do my job of ""being a woman."" But now that I'm considering that this is what I might be, I'm lost. It feels so right, and yet it also terrifies me, like I'm abandoning some part of me. 

I started keeping track of my feelings, documenting every single day for about a month now how I felt. For about a week straight, I'd feel like this, dysphoric, and then somewhere in between, for a day or two, it'd all be gone again, and during this time, I find myself saying things like, ""I'm being stupid; that was nothing; I'm just being influenced by others; I'm just lonely and I want a community to belong to, THAT's why I was being so weird, right?; What does gender even mean, why be worried about it?; I've always been somewhat ok with being a girl until now, why is it suddenly bothering me so much?; I like wearing girly clothes still, see?"" and I somehow talk down these feelings, and I feel like I'm ""comfortable"" again, and I don't mind being female as much. 

And then it just cycles back around, and I'm frustrated all over again. 

Mind you, I grew up in a VERY anti lgbt household/family. And, my dad's always been one to talk down my feelings \(related to other things, I haven't mentioned this to either of them.\) I notice, though, that sometimes when I'm talking to myself like this, it's almost like his voice is my own; like I'm thinking like him. It's weird. 

It might be internal transphobia. It might be me trying to tell myself the truth. It might be me lying to myself. I don't know what to believe anymore.

I'm a 35 year old trans woman married to a 35 year old cis woman. We've been together for 11 years and have an 11 year old boy.

My wife has become controlling, temperamental and disrespectful to the point where I no longer believe I have any hopes of being happy with her ever again.

My fear is that the HRT will trigger mood swings that will make it harder for me to avoid arguments. After all, it takes every scrap of spiritual stamina that I can muster as it is.

The change seems to occur most in people between the age of 8 and 20, when the human body is most into it's stage of growth, when hormones are surging and the mind is most unstable.

The desire to switch gender usually comes from the idea that the grass is greener on the other side, for the majority it is that they wish to become a woman, so they never have to grow up, so that they can remain childish and mothered by other people - so that they never have to go through adulthood. Lazy, selfish. I find most trans are incredibly narcissistic too, victims of their own complex now that they have designed, in a way, their dream girl, having given up looking for her, they become her, then wear her like a corpse over their real identity, and act as her, fooling others.

Having others see you as what you want is manipulation, it does not matter how you put it, and trans are sly, damaged people  who live through manipulation of themselves and their surroundings.

Even on the Internet they try their best to be feminine through their misguided view of women ("":3"" spam, etc).

You are a failed male.

They'll stay away.

A forgotten mirror.
A puddle of water.

The feelings flood in.
Cold and empty.
Lonely as a void.
No one around for miles.

Its almost funny.
How heavy nothing can feel.
Unladened yet over encumbered.
A blanket of shame
No one else can see.

One day I will be fine.
I'll rise with the sun.
Feel right as rain,
And carry on.
No one will be wiser
To the internal struggle
Burried inside.

But that day isn't today.
At least not right now,
Not in that way.
Because today I fucked up.

I'm a (currently) gay-identified AMAB and always thought of gender as strictly biological until the past couple years.

-When I was a kid, my brother and I would play pretend together &amp; often battle one another as our favorite superheroes. He would play as Superman, I'd play as Sailor Moon. I would also daydream and pretend to be various Disney princesses.

-As a kid I also went through a phase of wearing shirts &amp; towels on my head like wigs, flipping them around, and ""pretending"" to be a girl. I feel like I would have continued to do it had my older sister not shamed me for it. I didn't stop right away though, I would just do it in the mirror in the bathroom with the door locked but my dad walked in on me doing it once and shamed me, which is when I stopped altogether.

-After becoming aware of my innate homosexuality as a teenager &amp; going through the whole denial / acceptance number, I vowed I would never be ""one of those flamboyant gays"" even though I was still low-key feminine / ""gay looking"" and just not very self-aware lol.

-As I've become more comfortable with my sexuality &amp; made new friends (mostly girls or other gay men) I've felt less restricted in my behavior and tend to act authentically in stereotypically ""gay"" ways (though I think feminine might be a better word but idek what that even means anymore?) around these friends which I would never have DREAMED of doing as a teenager.

-I dress very ""trade"" in public, I have a shaved head &amp; facial hair, tend to attract submissive girls &amp; gay boys looking for the whole daddy dom thing but my personality / sexual preferences are the exact opposite. Looking back I think I consciously started to dress / act more ""straight"" because of ""masc for masc"" culture in the gay world but now it feels like an act I'm putting on to blend in.

-I did an impromptu drag performance (well, moreso gender-bending than full on drag) at a friend's show recently, really got in the zone, was dancing / behaving in ways I never do in public, felt amazing, received so much praise, felt good about myself &amp; was incredibly uninhibited (never am).

I'm feeling like I've repressed a lot of my feelings because I was always shamed for acting how I felt and am only just now coming to realize it. All this being said, I have a hard time thinking of full-on transitioning. I like how I look as a man, I like having facial hair, I think I look hot lol.

171,2018-04-26 00:43:56,8eymvj,3,1,"Hello everyone.

I am currently writing a story and I am trying to start planning out some scenes ahead of time. The reason why I am bringing this up here is because one of the characters of my story is a trans woman. In this story, the reader and the majority of the other characters are not immediately aware the character is trans. However, about half way through the story the main character will profess his feelings for her and this will cause her to feel obligated to reveal to him that she is trans. This is a rather important scene for my story so even though I am nowhere close to writing this specific part I want to start planning out some of the details because I want it to have a strong emotional impact while also maintaining a level of realism. As a cis male though I have no real life experience to draw upon for this scene so I was hoping to get some advice from everyone.

The general scene set up as I have it potentially planned out now is that up to this point it has been implied that she has had a secret that she has kept from all the other characters except her best friend. The main characters confesses his feelings for her only for her to quickly turn him down. It quickly becomes apparent that she feels the same about him and she only turned him down out of fear of how he would react to the truth. After a push from her best friend she reveals to the main character, and the reader, that she is trans. The main character is admittedly surprised by this but does make it clear that it does not affect how he feels for her, and the two officially start going out from this point on in the story.

The main things I want advice for is her reluctance to tell the truth and his reaction to said truth. Like I said, this is a very important scene to me and if a single thing is off I feel like the whole thing can fall flat. So, what advice would you give me? Is there any significant pitfalls other writers have made that you would advise me to avoid?

Thanks for taking the time to read and hopefully reply and provide me with advice. I’ve identified as DemiGuy for a number of years. The longer I’ve been in drug recovery and therapy the more I’ve been able to discuss and explore my gender identity. There’s days when I identify as either. I present male (beard and body hair). I use he/him and don’t like using “they/them” as they remind me of being bullied at school (being called “that thing” whilst “they/them” is not directly the same it reminds me of that time). Can I still use gendered pronouns and express my gender non-binary?

I’m really confused and this is effecting my relationships with people who assume or often tell me I should be using “they/them”

I have this awful creeping fear that I might be invalid because I'm in my early twenties and maybe I'm too late.

I'm not sure whether I am genderqueer or not, as all the lingo kinda goes over my head.

This is a bit about my background:
I was born with a male-assigned gender.
Growing up I felt comfortable and normal doing things that were traditionally femme like figure skating, wearing skirts, etc. And as an adult I take any excuse to wear make-up, paint my nails, etc. and it feels totally fine.

 I'm empathetic and a relationship builder. I don't feel particularly masculine.

I don't think I'm a cross-dresser because when I wear ""women's"" clothes or do makeup, my goal isn't to look like a woman. I just like it, and I do what I do.

35,2018-04-06 21:25:50,8ad8u3,16,0,"I posted this on a couple other subreddits but haven’t really gotten a response and I’m interested in thoughts.

I have always considered myself an open minded and easy going person. I have many friends in the LGBTQ community because I have always chosen to judge people on their actions and words as opposed to their personal life choices, this always included using the preferred pronouns of others. However, in the past couple of years my relationships seem to becoming strained by the political climate surrounding gender. I have always used the proper pronouns because I am a decent human being but that doesn’t mean I necessarily conform to their world views, just that it doesn’t hurt me to address them politely and if I like them as a person I don’t really care. 

Recently however it seems as though that is not enough and society to a large extent seems to be making a push to impose this worldview onto others. Maybe I’m wrong, I don’t know, but I see this as problematic for many reasons, mainly with it’s relation to empiricism and the overall well being of social understanding between individuals. Because of my views I’ve been called ignorant, transphobic, and bigoted, none of which is true. I’ve thought very long and hard on this because I always try to be impartial and reasoned when coming to a conclusion. I’ve read texts, articles, medical research, the whole nine yards. In the end I am a very logic and fact based thinker and after everything I think I’ve figured out what my issues with the recent social movement are.

Gender as an idea outside the bounds of physical sex was first developed by a psychologist as a way to attempt to describe those with Gender Dysphoria formerly known as Gender Identity Disorder. It is impossible to separate from physiology for that reason. People who truly have this condition do not simply see behaving in traditionally feminine ways with regards to gender norms or being called “she” as a fix to the problem, they experience extreme emotional distress with their physical bodies. 

This is why transitioning is such a big part of the trans experience for most today, simply adjusting the ways we relate with gender norms and pronouns is not enough. Sometimes, in rare instances, we even see cases where a male who identifies as female transitions to female and still continues to act in traditionally male ways, even retaining their attraction to women. This creates a dissonance with the idea that gender is truly a fluid emotional state because it was developed as a concept and is intrinsically tied to our physical bodies with how it relates to our feelings with regards to these issues.

Rather than, from the gender theory perspective, attempting to alter the way we apply empiricism and language in definitions, would it not be more productive to instead simply acknowledge gender norms are social constructs and therefore should not be given as much weight? If we were all to one day suddenly say a guy can act in traditionally female ways and be attracted to boys but that isn’t wrong, would that change the severe emotional distress inherent with transgenderism and their bodies? No.

This is why gender studies is not even a soft science like sociology, it is filled with thinking errors, justifications and double speak. If we say the body does not have a part in defining gender, and then we say all experiences are subjective and we can’t truly understand the feelings of another outside our personal views (one of their key arguments), then that means it is truly impossible for a person to just “feel” like a girl because they have no objective way of knowing how girls “feel”. This means it is inextricably tied to the physical body or perceived gender norms. 

Gender fluidity, non-binary, gender queer, these are all just words that seem to be used to convolute what it biologically means to be a man, woman, or all of the various birth abnormalities such as hyper androgyny or Klinesfeters through social perception. *Note, abnormality is not bad, just statistically unusual. We generally assign genders or even allow them to decide later on because as a society we are aware they do not fit cleanly into the binary. Assigning or allowing them to choose IS ACCEPTING them into normal society by not consistently pointing out that they are different. I understanding wanting to prevent alienation by saying there is no such thing as normal but with relation to statistical relevance I can’t disregard the existence of normalized biological states. To a certain extent I feel like pretending otherwise, at least in my mind, is almost patronizing. Rather than pretending it’s something it’s not we should just accept that person and whatever their choices may be. 

I think all these labels, in essence, are not only a fetishization of the trans experience, but they actually reinforce gender norms by saying actions and behaviors define who you are, therefore necessitating different terms to describe the behaviors. This means if you identify as a non-gender queer man, your actions would be limited to a certain array if you did not want to obscure your sense of self by behaving in non-traditional ways. If you do you’re queer but perhaps you do not perceive yourself as being “other”. So if labels are meant to be descriptive of the individuals feelings as well it is possible multiple people could all behave the same and have the same sex but identify different in terms of their label which eliminates even the meaning of the label. What determines which label you fit and how can we say how it feels to be a label if different people subjectively feel different about the label? In other words, it is applying an extreme amount of significance to something that is in fact, rather insignificant and oppressive in the idea that labels can give meaning to behavior or feelings or vice versa.

This is the inherent flaw in a fundamentally philosophical argument that more or less exploits sociological principles to make it’s points while at the same time shutting down opposition to the double speak in their arguments through coercion as opposed to reason.

I have the utmost sympathy for those who have Gender Dysphoria and will absolutely call them by their pronouns because I’m aware it is a condition that there is no current treatment for as an adult, if they TRULY have Gender Dysphoria. As it stands, 96% of people who identify as trans when pre-pubescent come to accept their bodies by the time they become teenagers. Instead, rather than trying to work with these children’s to help them understand their sexuality, because these people are almost always homosexual in orientation, now we’re telling them that they can be the opposing sex if they want. Beta blockers, hormone therapy, sex reassignment surgery, these are all incredibly invasive and generally irreversible treatments. When we can improve the emotional well being of a person and help them to accept themselves we should whenever possible as opposed to enabling a fundamental misunderstanding of self that leads to irreversible medical procedures.

I think gender studies needs to stop co-opting science and undermining empiricism in it’s assertions and instead focus on inclusion and acceptance as opposed to developing theories which convolute our perceptions of each other. We can all accept and respect each other while acknowledging behaviors are simply behaviors without having to tear down the principles of biological understanding itself. We can all accept the trans experience and incorporate them into society through understanding and inclusion without having to fundamentally tear down the relation between objectivity and subjectivity or undermining the scientific method.",genderqueer,Feeling Conflicted,1523075150.0,"{'created_utc': 1523049950, 'id': '8ad8u3', 'num_comments': 16, 'score': 0, 'selftext': 'I posted this on a couple other subreddits but haven’t really gotten a response and I’m interested in thoughts.\n\nI have always considered myself an open minded and easy going person. I have many friends in the LGBTQ community because I have always chosen to judge people on their actions and words as opposed to their personal life choices, this always included using the preferred pronouns of others. However, in the past couple of years my relationships seem to becoming strained by the political climate surrounding gender. I have always used the proper pronouns because I am a decent human being but that doesn’t mean I necessarily conform to their world views, just that it doesn’t hurt me to address them politely and if I like them as a person I don’t really care. \n\nRecently however it seems as though that is not enough and society to a large extent seems to be making a push to impose this worldview onto others. Maybe I’m wrong, I don’t know, but I see this as problematic for many reasons, mainly with it’s relation to empiricism and the overall well being of social understanding between individuals. Because of my views I’ve been called ignorant, transphobic, and bigoted, none of which is true. I’ve thought very long and hard on this because I always try to be impartial and reasoned when coming to a conclusion. I’ve read texts, articles, medical research, the whole nine yards. In the end I am a very logic and fact based thinker and after everything I think I’ve figured out what my issues with the recent social movement are.\n\nGender as an idea outside the bounds of physical sex was first developed by a psychologist as a way to attempt to describe those with Gender Dysphoria formerly known as Gender Identity Disorder. It is impossible to separate from physiology for that reason. People who truly have this condition do not simply see behaving in traditionally feminine ways with regards to gender norms or being called “she” as a fix to the problem, they experience extreme emotional distress with their physical bodies. \n\nThis is why transitioning is such a big part of the trans experience for most today, simply adjusting the ways we relate with gender norms and pronouns is not enough. Sometimes, in rare instances, we even see cases where a male who identifies as female transitions to female and still continues to act in traditionally male ways, even retaining their attraction to women. This creates a dissonance with the idea that gender is truly a fluid emotional state because it was developed as a concept and is intrinsically tied to our physical bodies with how it relates to our feelings with regards to these issues.\n\nRather than, from the gender theory perspective, attempting to alter the way we apply empiricism and language in definitions, would it not be more productive to instead simply acknowledge gender norms are social constructs and therefore should not be given as much weight? If we were all to one day suddenly say a guy can act in traditionally female ways and be attracted to boys but that isn’t wrong, would that change the severe emotional distress inherent with transgenderism and their bodies? No.\n\nThis is why gender studies is not even a soft science like sociology, it is filled with thinking errors, justifications and double speak. If we say the body does not have a part in defining gender, and then we say all experiences are subjective and we can’t truly understand the feelings of another outside our personal views (one of their key arguments), then that means it is truly impossible for a person to just “feel” like a girl because they have no objective way of knowing how girls “feel”. This means it is inextricably tied to the physical body or perceived gender norms. \n\nGender fluidity, non-binary, gender queer, these are all just words that seem to be used to convolute what it biologically means to be a man, woman, or all of the various birth abnormalities such as hyper androgyny or Klinesfeters through social perception. *Note, abnormality is not bad, just statistically unusual. We generally assign genders or even allow them to decide later on because as a society we are aware they do not fit cleanly into the binary. Assigning or allowing them to choose IS ACCEPTING them into normal society by not consistently pointing out that they are different. I understanding wanting to prevent alienation by saying there is no such thing as normal but with relation to statistical relevance I can’t disregard the existence of normalized biological states. To a certain extent I feel like pretending otherwise, at least in my mind, is almost patronizing. Rather than pretending it’s something it’s not we should just accept that person and whatever their choices may be. \n\nI think all these labels, in essence, are not only a fetishization of the trans experience, but they actually reinforce gender norms by saying actions and behaviors define who you are, therefore necessitating different terms to describe the behaviors. This means if you identify as a non-gender queer man, your actions would be limited to a certain array if you did not want to obscure your sense of self by behaving in non-traditional ways. If you do you’re queer but perhaps you do not perceive yourself as being “other”. So if labels are meant to be descriptive of the individuals feelings as well it is possible multiple people could all behave the same and have the same sex but identify different in terms of their label which eliminates even the meaning of the label. What determines which label you fit and how can we say how it feels to be a label if different people subjectively feel different about the label? In other words, it is applying an extreme amount of significance to something that is in fact, rather insignificant and oppressive in the idea that labels can give meaning to behavior or feelings or vice versa.\n\nThis is the inherent flaw in a fundamentally philosophical argument that more or less exploits sociological principles to make it’s points while at the same time shutting down opposition to the double speak in their arguments through coercion as opposed to reason.\n\nI have the utmost sympathy for those who have Gender Dysphoria and will absolutely call them by their pronouns because I’m aware it is a condition that there is no current treatment for as an adult, if they TRULY have Gender Dysphoria.

I have already felt like this before and I thought it was normal, but now that I am thinking deeply about my gender identity this feeling is getting worse and very annoying. Then I thought, is this some kind of gender dysphoria?
I have been loathing girly clothes, makeup, girly games and girly whatever since childhood – even if occasionally I’ve obviously tried to fit into society standards (for example trying to get into dolls, or to have nice Instagram posts like my popular girly classmates who looked so chill and happy all the time), feeling like I was betraying myself, but since I was a child I didn’t go any further. I also feel uneasy when people call me by my first name, by female pronouns, or “girl”; while I feel excited when my friends tell me the only thing between being male and me is a penis, and this kind of things.

61,2018-04-10 18:32:19,8ba25d,5,7,"First off I'm sorry, I know this question is almost impossible to answer in words.

I was assigned male at birth. Eventually accepted I was a crossdresser, realized it was more and labled myself bigender, then eventually labled myself a transwoman. I identified as a trans woman for quite some time, maybe around 9 months or so? Recently I've been feeling masculine identification coming back and ive actively wanted to experience it again. It hasn't been distressing in any way except for the fact that I'm now requestioning my gender identity. I have an appointment to start hormones at the end of the month and now I'm not entirely sure if that's right for me, but I'm still going to start them and see how it feels. I'm currently in a place where I really want to know for sure what my gender identity is but I've accepted that all I can know is how I feel day to day and maybe one day I'll have a concrete answer. 

Even when I was identifying as transfemme, saying I was a woman sounded a little off. I know for sure I'm not cisgender and so I don't think these feelings of masculinity are coming from a place of internalized transphobia. I'm currently exploring the fluidity of my gender or if I'd fit better in my own gender that is a combination of things from both sides of the spectrum. Even recently both my female and male names have just sounded like of off, and a more neutral name like Taylor or Alex is appealing to me. I'm the type of person who, when I find something new that I like, I dive into it 110%. Which makes me think that I identified as transfemme because the feminine side of me was a new experience and I wanted all of it. Now that I've lived that way for a while I'm thinking I might be getting back to baseline and actually fall somewhere in between or outside the gender spectrum.

So for those of you who are gender fluid, bigender, or non-binary, what is it like? How did you know?

It may be important to add that I openly present anywhere along the male to female spectrum, sometimes wanting to be closer to one side than the other. Even at the height of feeling femme, I was very happy just presenting femme in public and didn't really have an inner desire to have my body be that of a woman's. Generally I can be pretty happy in a mixed state, so like combining male and female clothing, while wearing makeup and nail polish and using my male voice or having some stubble. 

In terms of the effects from hormones my main desire would be less body hair and better skin, but breasts are fully neutral to me with no appeal or dislike.

I'm sure many of you could guess from the title, but whether I'm trans or something along the lines of bigender or gender neutral is something I've been trying to figure out for myself. I've had issues with dysphoria since puberty at the very latest. I went through a lot of the same stuff I imagine a lot of trans people did. I discovered tg fiction / porn and was content telling myself I just had a fetish for boys being turned into girls for most of high school and university. Eventually I accepted that I had some real issues with dysphoria but still didn't even consider transitioning. I think one of the reasons for this is because I've never really felt like I disliked being a man, just that being a (particularly a very feminine) woman really appealed to me. Over the past couple months I've been getting more real with myself. I've definitely accepted that I'm not a cis man, but I haven't really done anything with that information. I don't really feel like ids such as gender neutral or any of your box standard gender non-con identities really speak to me. But at the same time it doesn't feel super important that I label myself in that way. Right now I think I'm fine with masculine pronouns and people seeing me / treating me as a cis man as long as I know for myself I'm not cis. Basically I've felt determining that I wasn't cis was good enough for now.

Recently though I've stumbled across some of the trans / gender non conforming related subreddits, from the more serious ones like this to the more shitposty ones like r/traa and r/egg_irl and after lurking for a few days I really feel like I identify with a lot of the sentiments on here. I've historically acted and felt in ways that are considered ""eggy"" and the idea of being a woman certainly does appeal to me, but at the same time I really don't feel like I dislike my current body and self. Being a masculine non-cis person really doesn't bother me too much. It does sometimes, but at other times I'm perfectly happy with it and I really don't know if I've just persuaded myself I'm not trans or if I'm really not. I do definitely experience dysphoria and want to be a woman, but at the same time I don't not want to be a man if that makes sense? It feels like a shitty escapist hypothetical but if I could just seamlessly transition back and forth I think that while I would probably spend more time as a woman I would definitely still spend time as a man.

Anyways, I'll stop rambling. I'm definitely taking this issue more seriously now and I'm looking into seeing a therapist about this. But I'm just wondering what other people thought about this. How similar was your experience to mine and if you did have a similar experience what was the turning point that made you say ""yeah I'm gender non-con not trans""

*what I said is in italics*
**what she said in bold letters**

*""To begin with: do you know what the difference between the english ""sex"" and ""gender"" is? (the conversation was in another language, the differentiation between the two doesn't exist)""*

**""I think so""**

*""well sex is your biological sex and gender is basically what you feel you are""*

**""okay""**

*""and I've been struggeling quite a bit with what ""feeling like a woman"" actually feels like. I just feel like I don't have any connection to being female. It doesn't mean anything to me""*

**""well, yeah, it's just the way it is, I don't really feel anything about it either."" **

*""I just don't know what it's supposed to feel like to be a woman""*

**""but you're not unhappy with it, are you?""**

*""well, I'm not sure if I'm unhappy being a woman when I'm by myself, but now looking back, during my last 3 years of school (15-18 years) I at least tried hiding everything feminine about me...
I wore two sports bras on top of each other, one the wrong way around to bind my chest. I never wore tight clothes, didn't put on make up. 
But what really confuses me is that I still wore a dress and make up for prom (at the age of 18 where I'm from) and I didn't feel uncomfortable about that.""*

**""oh""**

*""but I don't want to be a man, I'm not a man. But I'm not sure about being a woman either.
Have you heard of non-binary genders?""*

**""no""**

*""well there is a lot of them, it's basically just anything that's not male or female. you know genderfluid for example? that's a non-binary gender, because it changes and it also includes being partly male, agender,... etc.
I was just wondering if I might be a part of those. But at the same time I don't even know if I believe in them myself.
A person I met recently said to me that they think that being non binary is less about being a new gender but of disregarding gender roles instead. And that kind of stuck with me. I've had similar thoughts about it.
What's strange though if it was just about disregarding gender roles, where does the dysphoria come from? You know what gender dysphoria is?""*

**""no not really""**

*""well it's basically just that feeling of being uncomfortable with your body, with the things that make you look like the sex you were assigned with at birth. for example me binding my chest or cutting my hair short happened because of my dysphoria. it makes me feel better in my own body.""*

**""what I find quite crazy is how human beings can think about these things. you know, it's basically just your brain right. and now you're thinking about why your brain is doing what it's doing with your brain. isn't that quite impressive?
Also why does nature even make people feel uncomfortable in their bodies? that doesn't make any sense at all... It has to do something with evolution. I don't feel like a person from the Stone Age was worried about what gender they were, they were just male and female and had to fight to survive.""**

*""oh that's really quite interessting, what I've been thinking about a lot as well is if gender is even real. You know, if society didn't exist and we were just by ourselves - would we even think about gender? Wouldn't we all just be human beings?
And that's why I don't wanna use any of these labels, although some of them fit me quite well. I'm just not sure if gender (or non binary genders) are even true. I just want to be who I am and I've come to the conclusion that I don't need a label for that. It has bothered me for far to long to be so insecure about who I am, just because I don't have a label for it. I'm just doing what feels best, and if cutting my hair and binding is a part of that, than I'm happy to do that. 
And I don't mind anymore if I'm agender, genderfluid or just a non-conforming woman, without a very strong connection to my gender.""*

We talked a bit more after that, about being brought up in quite a gender neutral environment, how we developed a feeling for gender or didn't, and how children develop through their environment full of binary adverts, gender roles, etc etc...

Just wanted to share this because it was the first time I tried talking about my feelings to a person that doesn't have a clue about gender and is a person that is very important to me.

I just wore sports bras for the past years, but they don't bind at all. My chest is smaller with them but it's still visible and makes me look very feminine which I absolutely can't stand.

Now I bought ace bandages and it feels so great finally having at least quite a flat chest, I'm just so much happier. But at the same time I obviously have all the negative things I heard about them in my mind and worry that I'm hurting my body.

I cut my hair the shortest I could. They still reach my shoulders: since they are curly and a lot, I wouldn’t look good if they were as short as I’d like them to be.

Some days ago I wrote a presentation for an online forum. I wrote I was a boy and I chose a male name I like. After a bit, I started to cry desperately because my internet persona matches me more than my image reflected in the mirror. I just don’t look like who I am. When people look at me they aren’t seeing me, and when I look at the mirror it’s not me the person I see.

I don’t fit in my body, right now, but earlier I did. I mean, I wasn’t dysphoric. Is it possible that I am overthinking?
I am always spacing out and fantasizing to escape from reality, and sometimes I just pretend to be someone else to cope. I wonder if I am not just playing a character.

I grew up in a very conservative and religious area, so being cis-female and straight was my only option. But I was very ""boyish"" growing up. I didn't really start feeling more feminine until I got my first period, and that's when I asked to grow my hair long and to buy feminine clothing. But I remember when I got my first period and my mother said something about me becoming a woman, and that my body was preparing itself to have a child. And it freaked me out on so many levels for years. It's almost like I started presenting more feminine in response to getting my period. Since then, I've hated boobs and curves. I call it the C-cup curse. 

It wasn't until I moved out for college that I started learning more about myself. I had to learn and undo a lot of homophobia and transphobia that I'd been raised on. It took about a year after moving out to discover that I'm probably asexual and that I'm attracted to multiple genders. 

The past 6 months or so is when it started to get confusing. I realized that maybe my attraction to men wasn't sexual or romantic, but actually me wanting to be them, to present like them. So I started researching more and found out about all the various genders there are. And the ones that really stuck out were genderfluid and demigender. 

At the moment, I'm not ready to give up some aspects of being female, no matter how much and how long I've wished to present as masculine.

I came out around the same time I had a bunch of real intense surgeries and was in a wheelchair for a year. Painkillers for some reason do absolutely nothing for me, so I wound up tossing a bunch of them that I didn't take in a drawer. It wasn't on purpose, I'm kind of a packrat and I figured maybe I'd need it again some day.

After my parents disowned me for being trans, I didn't even have to look for it -- I knew right where it was. I kept it on hand for a long time, I researched how much I would have to take for it to be lethal and downloaded a PDF about fatal dosages to my laptop. I'm a super fucking big X-Men nerd so I always looked at it as that adamantium bullet in Logan. I really wanted to do it a lot of times, and I honestly don't have a good answer to why I didn't.

Anyway, my life has still been a chaotic nightmare. I haven't had a stable home for a few months and for a bit I stayed with a childhood friend of mine for a while while couch surfing. He used to be really fucking conservative, but since I came out to him, he's been one of the few people who really genuinely tried to understand what I was going through. For a couple of weeks, I let him borrow my computer when his broke. 

When I left his house he casually asked about keeping the old medication I wasn't taking at his place (a lot of my other stuff was staying there so maybe it was on accident, he didn't reference the medication specifically but did ask about the bag it was in). He's been through a lot physically the last few years and had his body beat the fuck up so maybe he just wanted to keep them. But I also think a lot about how he had access to that PDF document on my desktop. I think he knew. 

I wasn't in immediate danger of taking it, but it was definitely my escape route. I didn't say no when he asked about taking it -- it immediately crossed my mind that I wouldn't have access to that medication again -- but it was a conscious choice to let that option go.

(I’m a 26yo afab NB person, long-time lurker of this sub, first time posting!)

A few months ago I finally accepted that my discomfort with my body could possibly be alleviated with hrt - I’m the sort of person who will ruminate on something for a long time, and upon arriving at a conclusion will settle down quickly. My current view of my gender is that while I like expressing femininity at times, it feels more like a performance, and I don’t like being read as female when I’m not actively choosing to express my feminine side. I feel like my ‘baseline’ is much more masculine than what my body and face allows me to be read as, if that makes sense.
I do have concerns about doing hrt - mainly I’m worried about 1) having to come out to my family and acquaintances (which I’m just going to have to suck up when/if it gets to that), 2) that being read as male all the time will end up feeling as wrong as being read female all the time (which, even if that happens, I can’t imagine would be worse than how I feel now), and 3) that I won’t be comfortable expressing my femininity anymore after transitioning (which would honestly be an acceptable loss if it meant not having to deal with everything else).
My therapist keeps suggesting I talk more about my concerns about hrt, and that I should talk them through before he’ll refer me to an endocrinologist, but I don’t know what else to say! Knowing myself, #1 is something I’m going to worry about until I get it done, and #2 and #3 are only possibilities and I won’t know until I get there, y’know?
I understand his concern that I’m rushing, but this has been coming for a long time and I can’t imagine myself continuing to live with my body as it is now, and I feel like he thinks I’m neglecting to talk about something.

None my my acquaintances are GQ, and the one trans dude I know is an ex of mine who I’m pretty sure wouldn’t be comfortable discussing this with me, so I’ve finally gathered up the courage to post here!

• I know that I can’t “pick and choose” what effects I’m going to get, and I’m not trying to
• I know the effects of testosterone will eventually level off at some point, they aren’t permanently cumulative (you don’t see cis men, for example, constantly being more masculinized after puberty due to the natural testosterone levels in their systems)
• I know testosterone is a stronger hormone than estrogen, effects-wise
• I know everyone has different androgen sensitivity levels

My boyfriend is a trans man and he is taking 50mg of T every week, so I have a pretty good firsthand idea of what the effects are, though I know it varies for everyone. I think I’d like to start at 25mg a week and adjust the dosage if needed, depending on how quickly things go, how I feel, etc.

Basically, I want to try and “level out” my appearance, voice, hair, etc. to be more balanced between the effects of estrogen and testosterone. I know it won’t be completely even or anything.

171,2018-04-26 11:37:31,8f1y9p,8,4,"First off, hi, I’ve been thinking and thinking for a long time and I’m just so confused as to what I’m feeling and what I could be, so I hope I can get some advice. Forgive me, as I’m not the best writer, it’ll be a mess to read.

I’m 18, gay and AMAB. For around 3 years, I’ve been struggling with how I feel and what exactly I am.

I don’t really have an issue with being seen as/referred to as he and male, and I think I would prefer it to stay that way as I feel that she and her wouldn’t feel right, but I still get these weird unexplainable feelings that cause massive anxiety, when I think about this topic, so I don’t know what to do. I look down at my body and feel like something isn’t right, but I don’t know what, I wouldn’t rather have a femal body/figure though, as it just wouldn’t feel right to me. Honestly I sometimes feel like I’m not even human. Ive noticed that when I feel this way, i feel very antisocial and would rather be alone all day, could this just be my normal anxiety going crazy. 

I wouldn’t say I’m particularly masculine or feminine, maybe leaning a bit more towards masculine (I’m not even sure how you’d determine what is), but sometimes, I don’t feel like I fit with Male label but I still have a little affinity with it but lean towards women more, but then again this could be more of a social thing.

This is more of a physical thing, I’m not happy with how my body is, due to being overweight and generally unhealthy, I have some body hair but I’m neutral towards it, sometimes I wish it was more visable, others I don’t mind it. Although I do find it interesting to look at at times, I don’t think I’d like to remove all of it. In terms of my face, I don’t have much confidence in how I look, but it isn’t really due to looking male. As for my hair, I’m not sure if I would prefer longer or shorter, as I have only had it short, but I think long wouldn’t fit me as a guy.

As for my penis, I’m not sure, sometimes I’m fine with it, other times I’m not fine. Not sure if I’d want a vagina though.

Sometimes I get a feeling in and around my chest and nipples, it’s kind of like a phantom breast thing, it’s that or my nipples could be rubbing against my shirt or maybe just my social anxiety. I’m not sure what this feeling means.

On the rare occasion that I do see straight porn, I usually imagine myself as the girl, and how PIV sex would feel for me, I also rarely have sexual fantasies as a woman. Does this mean anything? With gay porn, I put myself in what position I feel like.

That’s all the feelings I can think of right now. I’m sorry it’s such a mess, and I probably sound crazy but I’m not sure how to get it all down coherently. I’m aware that I don’t need to label myself, but doing so would help me understand how I feel. The constant questioning is driving me crazy and piles on to my already existing anxiety and depression. A lot of the time, I can’t tell if I do feel this way, or my mind is just screwing with me, after all I tend to copy other people’s feelings without actually feeling that way.

I do have one question, how do you know when you feel more Male or female? Is it just a feeling that you know?

I was wondering if anyone here had any recommendations for books with genderqueer societies or characters, or where gender is viewed much differently than it is today? For example, The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula Le Guin is set in a world where everybody is genderless except for once a month, when they temporarily become male or female. I also really liked Ancillary Justice \- the main character is an artificial intelligence and has no gender, and comes from a planet where gender is disregarded completely.

I was born male but ever since I was around 14 (19 now) I've been confused about my gender. I've done small bits of cross-dressing (trying female underwear, wearing women's clothing) and whenever I see a cute girl I think she's attractive but also that I wish I could be her but as I'm still confused I don't want to announce I'm all this or that just yet because I just don't know.

A few years ago I researched gender terms and their meanings and came across ""genderfluid"" and thought I was beginning to understand these feelings I'd been having as sometimes I feel male and masculine but also female &amp; feminine.

On to last night, I went around to see my two friends ""B"" (19/F) &amp; her boyfriend ""R"" (21/M). We got on to the topic of Germaine Greer and her view that Trans-women aren't real women. I strongly oppose this view and believe they are just as much women as cis-women are. Us three have had conversations about gender before and I'm strongly for any gender identity or expression a person may have, B &amp; R think the opposite, B especially thinks  that society's got out of hand and that there are only males &amp; females and that your genitalia automatically denotes your gender. 

B accepts that trans-women want to be women as that's how they feel but at the same time doesn't think believe they're real women. After explaining that I have a cousin that is Agender I blurted out that I'm confused about my gender and that I can feel both male &amp; female. B laughed at me and asked if I had a penis to which I said yes to which she said well then you're a guy then there's no question. 

R just sat there pretty much. After this exchange between B &amp; I I felt uncomfortable, offended and left. I still feel upset about it today so I called my sister (24/F) whose really understanding and open-minded about these things and she calmed me down and said to possibly write B a text explaining how I feel.

What do you think about the conversation I had with B? What would you do in my situation?

P.S. I'm in the UK &amp; I just wondered if anyone genderfluid on here has been to The Tavistock &amp; Portman's gender clinic? If so, what was your experience because I've only read stories from transpeople.

My gender identity is rarely at ""man"" mode. When it is at ""man"" I cannot for one second even fathom being with a man. Like, the thought just doesn't cross my mind at all. When I am ""man,"" which is rare, I am a straight man and kinda vanilla at that level.

It felt good the first few days, like things I felt started to make sense, but then I started doubting.. And with doubt came frantic googling and with that came even more confusion and doubt. 
For 18 years I've identified as a cis female, when I questioned my sexuality I was able to easily say ""I'm pan"", but this? Gender?? It's so much more than that. Do I need dysphoria? Do I HAVE dysphoria?? Am I just overreacting? How do I know i'm not just gender nonconforming? 
My entire life it's been ""Well she has two brothers! Of course she's a little boyish"" which I just went along with. Sometimes i'd look at myself and wish I had parts I didn't but I simply brushed it off to be nothing. This was all ok, identifying as a cis female, until I shaved my hair.. I went from over 3 feet of hair that i'd always accidentally sit on, to half an inch buzz cut because the entire night and next morning I just wanted it all gone. That's when it all started, if I had to pinpoint a specific time.
The feelings of wanting parts there that weren't got stronger (to the point where i'd have to say it to friends/family in a joking manner because I couldn't get it out of my head otherwise), the way I dressed became much more.. Defined? One day it could be a very obvious masculine look, the other extremely feminine, and some just.. Kinda like I threw together something in a half asleep daze haha. 
I don't even know if i'm making sense anymore. My mind is a mess and trying to look into articles and videos only makes me more confused.
I know a gender therapist could help, I mean I just need one in general cause my mental illnesses, but that's something that will take me a while to get and I don't have time with how loud my mind is being about this.

Would.. Buying a packer be wasteful at this point, since i'm not even sure?? My big issue isn't my chest, that I can easily flatten with a sports bra, it's what's between my legs.

22,2018-04-10 18:04:08,8b9tlm,4,18,"First off I'm sorry, I know this question is almost impossible to answer in words.

I was assigned male at birth. Eventually accepted I was a crossdresser, realized it was more and labled myself bigender, then eventually labled myself a transwoman. I identified as a trans woman for quite some time, maybe around 9 months or so? Recently I've been feeling masculine identification coming back and ive actively wanted to experience it again. It hasn't been distressing in any way except for the fact that I'm now requestioning my gender identity. I have an appointment to start hormones at the end of the month and now I'm not entirely sure if that's right for me, but I'm still going to start them and see how it feels. I'm currently in a place where I really want to know for sure what my gender identity is but I've accepted that all I can know is how I feel day to day and maybe one day I'll have a concrete answer. 

Even when I was identifying as transfemme, saying I was a woman sounded a little off. I know for sure I'm not cisgender and so I don't think these feelings of masculinity are coming from a place of internalized transphobia. I'm currently exploring the fluidity of my gender or if I'd fit better in my own gender that is a combination of things from both sides of the spectrum. Even recently both my female and male names have just sounded like of off, and a more neutral name like Taylor or Alex is appealing to me. I'm the type of person who, when I find something new that I like, I dive into it 110%. Which makes me think that I identified as transfemme because the feminine side of me was a new experience and I wanted all of it. Now that I've lived that way for a while I'm thinking I might be getting back to baseline and actually fall somewhere in between or outside the gender spectrum.

So for those of you who are gender fluid, bigender, or non-binary, what is it like? How did you know?

It may be important to add that I openly present anywhere along the male to female spectrum, sometimes wanting to be closer to one side than the other. Even at the height of feeling femme, I was very happy just presenting femme in public and didn't really have an inner desire to have my body be that of a woman's. Generally I can be pretty happy in a mixed state, so like combining male and female clothing, while wearing makeup and nail polish and using my male voice or having some stubble. 

In terms of the effects from hormones my main desire would be less body hair and better skin, but breasts are fully neutral to me with no appeal or dislike. And honestly I think one of the biggest things I hoped to get from physically transitioning would be getting rid of depression which to me doesn't sound like it should be the main reason to transition, because if I was still depressed after I wouldn't be satisfied with the transition.",genderfluid,What does it feel like to be gender fluid/non-binary/bigender?,1523408648.0,"{'created_utc': 1523383448, 'id': '8b9tlm', 'num_comments': 4, 'score': 18, 'selftext': ""First off I'm sorry, I know this question is almost impossible to answer in words.\n\nI was assigned male at birth.

32,2018-04-13 05:12:44,8bwr4a,16,6,Hi there everyone. So this is completely new to me and I actually need help. For a while I’ve always felt that I wasn’t just male. I always took interest in “female only” things. The clothing. Styles. Hair. Other material items. And then more personal things. Such as being able to talk about anything or dance or just enjoy life without being judged or made fun of because “it’s too girly” and there’s a lot more to it but I’m a little shaky and pushing past my comfort zone even typing this. (I grew up in the Deep South. So toxic masculinity is a real terrible thing) and honestly I think I might be gender fluid. Because I feel like I’m more than just an effeminate male but at the same time I keep questions myself because I have no idea what it’s like to “feel” female. Like. How do I separate feeling female from feeling effeminate. If anyone could explain it or offer advice of anything feel free to shoot me a PM if you don’t feel comfortable talking about it here. I just need advice. ,genderfluid,A lot of questions and a lot of confusion.

45,2018-04-20 22:53:27,8drqqf,0,29,"I can't believe I'm here writing this as a 35 male.  3 months ago, I don't think I even knew the term gender fluid, never mind thought it applied to me.  It does.  In these last 3 months, I've started seeing a new therapist on a regular basis.  Not even for any gender issues.  Simply due to issues in other parts of my life.  My feminine side and cross dressing came up though, mostly because I did notice that one of her areas of expertise was LGBT.   Cross dressing has been a tiny tiny part of my life since I was in single digits, but not a significant part, not a part I felt I needed to talk about, and not a part I thought I needed to get more from.  I was wrong.  It's like I've been given permission (from my therapist), though not literally.  I said I like labels, so we talked about it, and gender fluid fits for me.  Since then, I've embraced it.  So much embraced it.  

I used to steal some of my wife's clothes, tank tops, panties, socks, leggings, etc.  She'd give me a hard time about it in a light hearted way, and said she thought I was gay.  I'm not gay, and I know she's evolved enough to know cross dressing and being gay are not related, so it was just a funny conversation for us and an easy way to brush off the cross dressing.  When she wasn't around, I'd go a little further with the cross dressing, and I've probably tried on every single thing in her closet at least once.  One time I even went all the way, went full female with wig and makeup, and went out in public to get a massage at an Asian place that felt like a safe zone because they didn't speak great English.  It went really well, and I didn't feel judged (doubt I was convincing as female though - make up is hard!).  I guess I didn't have a name then, but now it's Ella :)

It was always about more than the cross dressing.  Everyone always talks about my feminine side, and I've been called metro sexual.  I'm sensitive, would rather talk about emotions than make small talk, my best friends were always girls, and I had a hard time relating to guys unless they were also on the feminine side or gay.  I just didn't fit the guys guy mold at all.  Someone said something that stuck with me too; that it makes sense that some people want to be what they're enamored with.  In my case, wanting to be female sometimes.

My therapist is my heaven.  She is perfect for me, and we have clicked in an unbelievable way.  Since seeing her, I've had a little conversation with my wife about it, and though I felt like I held back a little in explaining my desires (I'll get there), she was totally cool with me describing myself as gender fluid.  I've worn female clothes around her since, more than normal, and she hasn't had the same jab at me; maybe even went a little crazy (in the good way) with me wearing her panties one night.  I also came out to my best friend (female), who has been nothing but supportive, and I even told my regular massage therapist (another safe zone).  I reached out to a friend who transitioned from m2f a few years ago; I was totally supportive at the time, but never thought we'd have this in common.

This has just exploded for me.  I'm as excited about it as I have been about anything in ages.  I've realized this is important to me, and I want to share it in some small fashion and make it part of me.  Not all the way; not at work, not around my 3 kids, or family members.  I'm sure everyone would be supportive, but I don't have that desire at this time, and can't see myself getting there.  I am really embracing it though, and I'm not feeling guilty about it anymore.  I'm ready to experience new things; shaving my legs, make up, painting nails, buying girls clothes for myself for once, and not just for my wife.  Don't worry, she'll get new cute things too :)

55,2018-04-25 20:42:17,8ewx1c,11,4,"First off, hi, I’ve been thinking and thinking for a long time and I’m just so confused as to what I’m feeling and what I could be, so I hope I can get some advice. Forgive me, as I’m not the best writer, it’ll be a mess to read.

I’m 18, gay and AMAB. For around 3 years, I’ve been struggling with how I feel and what exactly I am. 

I don’t really have an issue with being seen as/referred to as he and male, and I think I would prefer it to stay that way, but I still get these weird unexplainable feelings that cause massive anxiety, when I think about this topic, so I don’t know what to do. I look down at my body and feel like something isn’t right, but I don’t know what, I wouldn’t rather have a femal body/figure though, as it just wouldn’t feel right to me. Honestly I sometimes feel like I’m not even human.

I wouldn’t say I’m particularly masculine or feminine, maybe leaning a bit more towards masculine (I’m not even sure how you’d determine what is), but sometimes, I don’t feel like I fit with Male label but I still have a little affinity with it, but then again this could be more of a social thing.

This is more of a physical thing, I’m not happy with how my body is, due to being overweight and generally unhealthy, I have some body hair but I’m neutral towards it, sometimes I wish it was more visable, others I don’t mind it. Although I do find it interesting to look at at times, I don’t think I’d like to remove all of it. 
In terms of my face, I don’t have much confidence in how I look, but it isn’t really due to looking male. As for my hair, I’m not sure if I would prefer longer or shorter, as I have only had it short, but I think long wouldn’t fit me as a guy.

As for my penis, I’m not sure, sometimes I’m fine with it, other times I’m not fine. Not sure if I’d want a vagina though. 

Sometimes I get a feeling in and around my chest and nipples, it’s kind of like a phantom breast thing, it’s that or my nipples could be rubbing against my shirt or maybe just my social anxiety. I’m not sure what this feeling means. 

On the rare occasion that I do see straight porn, I usually imagine myself as the girl, and how PIV sex would feel for me, I also rarely have sexual fantasies as a woman. Does this mean anything? With gay porn, I put myself in what position I feel like.

That’s all the feelings I can think of right now. I’m sorry it’s such a mess, and I probably sound crazy but I’m not sure how to get it all down coherently. I’m aware that I don’t need to label myself, but doing so would help me understand how I feel. The constant questioning is driving me crazy and piles on to my already existing anxiety and depression. A lot of the time, I can’t tell if I do feel this way, or my mind is just screwing with me, after all I tend to copy other people’s feelings without actually feeling that way.

I’d appreciate any help and I’m free to answer any questions you have. Thanks for reading.

56,2018-04-26 09:31:26,8f1cqb,14,8,"I'm gonna try to keep this simple...

Call me Chester. I was female at birth. Throughout my years I started feeling male as well. I feel uncomfortable in my body, but I don't want to permanently change it. I know there's ways around like binding and I've heard of some underwear that mimic having a penis. But here's the problem: I don't know what I am.

I've decided to stick with genderfluid because there are some days I feel very female, though I will never wear skirts or tank tops because I don't like how revealing they are on me. But then I feel extremely male and accidentally wound up naming that side of myself ""Chester"". I find that I feel male most of the time. Like 80% male and 20% female. Here's the second problem: I'm having a hard time accepting this side of me. Being a lesbian? Got it down. I'm totally fine with it.

I've also found out that I'm totally fine with being called he/him and I ADORE being called handsome and I would even go so far as to say if my girlfriend called me her ""boyfriend"" I'd be pretty ecstatic over it. I know one thing for sure, I am not trans. Because I do enjoy my woman body a lot of the time, and again, would never ever want a permanent change.

I've come to resent myself over this. My girlfriend does know about this, and she's been very supportive. It just frightens me to feel so out og place because I'm scared to make that first leap into buying a binder.

So 3 questions I guess.

What the hell am I? Where can I get a good binder? How can I go about accepting this ""Chester"" side of me?...
