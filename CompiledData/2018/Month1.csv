I am a person who was born male, like my male appearance and male features such as body structure(well kinda chubby), facial hair etc but always felt that my genitals didnt really fit me, i just considered myself somekind of exclusive bottom but it still didnt feel quite right.
Since i took this thing more seriously and decided to be more open about wanting to be a man with a vagina everything felt right and started considering surgery more seriously, already got a referral letter from a more known online therapist since I am from Greece which doesnt have many gender therapist, let alone ones that would consider suggesting someone for srs if they are not binary transgender.

13,2018-01-03 22:43:29,7nyed4,3,20,"One year ago today I finally figured out I'm transgender: nonbinary: bi-gender AFAB. The most amazing thing is that once I figured out I'm not cis, it took me all of an hour to figure out *exactly* where I fit in the transgender spectrum. I am both female and male. Even though I was 47, there was no adjustment for me, no upset or doubt. It was immediately liberating, a relief to finally have an answer to why I'd felt so out of place from childhood. My identity settled into my bones easily. Perhaps because I never knew it was there to hide it. I've just gone with it, never knowing what it was. When I started coming out to family and friends, a common response was ""yeah, that makes sense"" or ""I didn't have a name for it, but I knew it."" Sometimes I think I was the last to know.

Over the last year that led me to explore exactly what I wanted to do with this knowledge. Did I want to make any kind of transition? Presentation (clothes, hair, etc)? Hormonal? Medical/surgical? I experimented a bit. I tried testosterone, and it was right, until it wasn't. I bought some men's clothes. Got my hair cut short.

For a while I was kinda stuck in the middle, situationally one or the other for short periods of time, but usually both, not really a mix in the middle like an androgyne person, but able to see/feel/be both sides more or less equally. Then I went on the strongest masc swing of my life. I felt like I was a transguy, completely. I couldn't see the girl in me at all, except for my continued love of all things girly and sparkly.

It was my dearest wish from the time I hit puberty to really FEEL like a girl. I would much rather be cis female than any other option. And I loved it. I quit testosterone and went *full girly* and it felt as amazing as I imagined it would. I'm still on that swing. At the moment I feel like I'm cis female, but I know my guy side will eventually come back.

I've also figured out that while my guy side is a guy, and wants to be a guy, for the most part, I don't want to look like a guy, I want to be a guy. I like my outer girly appearance (perhaps my guy side is okay with it because I'm not particularly naturally feminine in build) and love girly clothes and sparkly things. But I also get an odd dual pleasure out of wearing all guy clothes - and making them look totally femme.

28,2018-01-06 17:36:48,7okl5e,6,22,"Hi. 

I've questioned my gender identity since I was 4/5. When I was 14/15 I discovered the concept of being transgender and came out as genderfluid. I thought about this for a while and realised I might actually be a 100% binary trans man. It was too overwhelming to deal with so I went back into the closet.

A few months ago I came out again, but as a trans man. I asked people to use he/him pronouns and use a new name for me, for christmas I got male gendered presents and I started living as male for a month or so. It was great. Then something happened (I met my boyfriends family) and I realised that I won't be able to transition for the foreseeable future so I became ""okay"" with that. I'm not sure if I'm in denial or not. Now when I think about presenting as male, I feel weird, almost dysphoric. 

I started dressing overly girly and wearing makeup and wigs like I've done several times in the past. I have a history of trauma and mainly like appearing as a girl to get attention from men. (I know, it's awful.) I like the way I look in female clothes because I get complimented and think of myself as attractive. I feel more confident and sexy as a girl but it feels like an overly-dramatised version of myself, like it's just acting and eventually i'll stop pretending and be ""me"" again. I do enjoy acting like a girl though. I have dysphoria but it comes and goes, sometimes it's severe and sometimes it's not there at all. 

When I present as male, I feel more ""me"" but I don't feel attractive at all. I don't know if me switching between these girl and guy phases means I'm genderfluid or whether I'm just in serious denial about my gender and seeking validation by dressing as a woman. If a cis guy cross-dresses for sexual reasons, they're not trans, so wouldn't it be the same for a trans guy? (Only it would mean they were infact male)

Any input? Thanks.

A little bit of background: I’m a 27yo AMAB and I’ve low-key been questioning my gender and sexuality since roughly the end of puberty - so for about 10 years. As a child/teen I’ve been totally fine with being a boy and the prospect of only dating girls. At 17 I came out to myself as bi, triggered by the fact that i had developed a crush on a male friend of mine. In the years ~5 years after that I continued to question my sexuality as I went through the “bi-cycle” and got some practical experience. Result: I’m predominantly attracted to women but also to men, to a lesser degree though. 

On to the gender part: I wasn’t fully comfortable with the male role for that same period of time but until recently didn’t put a label onto it. I’ve mainly played women in video games for about 10 years, I’ve been given a female nickname by at one point of which I approved, so it stuck, and I first acknowledged feminine aspects of my identity in a non-playful/joking when I stumbled upon the “Genderbread Person”. But to me all of that wasn’t a denial of masculinity so much as something extra. I thought of my masculinity as just being somewhat more sensitive and non-macho. That changed last year when one of my favorite YouTubers ContraPoints (if you don’t know her, srsly check her out, she’s amazing) came out as genderqueer. I guess seeing you respect adopt a non-binary identity makes it less scary to see yourself that way. I thought of **agender** as a term that could fit me but so far hadn’t committed to it. 

Enter the worst sex of my life. Yesterday I had a one-night stand with a women and it was terrible. What really got to me is that other than all my previous partners she didn’t treat me like a person, she treated me like a **man**. Everything she did was done with the assumption that I am a man: Foreplay? Not needed. Erogenous zone? Just the dick. Body that is meant to be desired? Just hers, never mine. Dirty talk? Meant to boost my masculinity (god, that was irritating). Throughout the whole process I had to steer her away from that.

I had never realized this before but everything that I had ever enjoyed about sex was not explicitly gendered. The sex I had with women could have been either straight or lesbian (if we consider the social roles involved). The sex with men could have been gay or straight. For years while trying to figure out my sexuality I’ve only considered the other persons gender and never my own. “What portion of me is gay, what portion is straight?” Surprise motherfucker, some part is actually lesbian!

Since I live in a large city in a western country surrounded by progressive minded people the issue of gender doesn’t come up in the rest of my life that often but I think the pattern just described applies. I’m fine with the way I’m treated as long I’m not expected to be a man. 

And now I’m sitting here with the unavoidable conclusion that I’m not in fact a man. I don’t know what I am. Agender, genderfluid, maybe even trans women (I really hope not, that would have some uncomfortable consequences in terms of transitioning)? Outside the occasional societal pressure I don’t feel that uncomfortable with myself. I accept my body, i just don’t like how hairy it is. I don’t have a desire to be seen as a woman, even though I feel good if things about me are feminine. I’ve realized a while ago that the sentence “I am a man” feels like a lie.

34,2018-01-07 16:24:02,7orgvj,2,5,"Hey all,
This is gonna be a disjointed kind of post, because I am really confused and distressed atm; heads up.

I am AFAB, but since I was introduced to the concept of gender beyond cis female and cis male (about 17/18) I have questioned my cis gender 'status', as it were, on and off.

I have gone through a few ""AHA!"" moments, thinking I'd resolved my confusion, only to have myself revisit the same shit over and over and over.   

I have come to the conclusion that I'm cis female, but I am gender non-conforming twice now, only to self doubt all over again when something triggers the topic within me. 

A big thing that I am grappling with is that I have Borderline Personality Disorder and Asperger's, which makes me worried that I'm forcefully trying to take on a new persona to avoid who I am currently; that I'm grasping to TRY TO be Enby/Demi, instead of ACTUALLY being Enby/Demi .  

The last month or so I've had the repeated thought of ""I don't WANT to be a cis woman!"" and I am trying to figure out if that's because I'm legitimately NOT or because again, I am desperately trying to be something else and just don't want to be ME; if that makes sense?

I feel like, if someone said to me ""Okay tomorrow you will be a ""passable"" man""  I wouldn't be upset about losing my identity as a woman.  I identify with being a woman, I am a woman, but I always feel like there's more to me than JUST being a woman? 

I am heavily into the hardcore/punk/metal scene and I always feel really jealous of the men in pits, because I love the masculine energy, and wish I was more part of it.  

I also found that growing up as a teen, and now as an adult, I mimic traditionally masculine behaviours more than feminine behaviours. I distinctly recall mimicking Renton from Trainspotting's [pose](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e5/ae/db/e5aedb63e0f8b65dc67c5f85215ea5b4--trainspotting-poster-renton-trainspotting.jpg) and purposefully lowering my voice around male peers to break out of the ""like other girls"" mould.  

I look at all male hardcore bands and wish I looked more like them, [aesthetically](http://www.fearlessrecords.com/fearlessrecords/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/movements_10000.jpg) but also ROCK a dress and love getting made up.  

Basically, around women I feel out of place and not feminine/pretty enough, and awkward, and around men I feel tiny and too femme and I envy them.

I am so confused and wish there was a way to tell if I don't like being cis because I am NOT CIS, or because I am so desperate to be ~different~ and NOT ME.   It might be fruitful to mention that my best friend is MTF Trans; but I met them AFTER I started questioning at 18 (1.5 years later-ish?) so I am not sure that is a factor here.

38,2018-01-07 22:56:08,7ou2nq,5,13,"So, a bit of background

When I was growing up, there was very little discussion of sexuality, gender, identity, etc. As a result, I didn't do much questioning and there wasn't really anyone I could ask. So, when I went to the bathroom or showered, and was kinda grossed out by my genitals, I figured that was completely normal. Or, when I saw a woman in a dress and wondered what I might look in it, I figured everybody had feelings like that. Come to find out, that is not really the case. But, nevertheless, I never thought that my feelings were strong enough to warrant any meaningful deviation from the norm.

Even after the increased in trans awareness over the past few years, I still did not see myself as a part of that group if only because many of the stories, and the way they were presented all seemed to come across in the same way. ""I always knew I was X despite constantly being told I was Y, but now, I am able to realise my true self."" But since I was not entirely certain, or did not feel as strongly about my identity growing up, I felt that I did not belong in said group. It seemed as though if I was a particular way, I would know it, or would at least have always suspected. Since I didn't, I figured I wasn't.

It's also hard to know whether or not my feelings ""qualify"" me as part of these groups because when asked what dysphoria or whatever else feels like, people find it hard to describe. So, here I am, wondering if what I'm feeling is similar to what others feel, and neither of us can describe what that feeling is.

Anyway, over the last few years I've been interrogating how I feel about certain things, and begun to suspect that I might be nonbinary. But, since the ""feelings"" that make me think this do not present all the time, when they are in remission, of sorts, I begin to doubt whether or not they were ever really there at all. I visit the LGBT Resource center where I go to school in the hopes that the environment might bring them about. But, all I see around me are people who feel completely certain in who they are. And all it reminds me of is how certain I am not. And let me just say that I understand there is no way of knowing how someone really feels based on their outward appearances, but still. I continue to feel out of place.

A while back, I watched [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_alNELGiHI) video and in the description was a link to [this](http://garote.bdmonkeys.net/bsri.html?A1=3&amp;B1=6&amp;C1=6&amp;A2=6&amp;B2=3&amp;C2=2&amp;A3=4&amp;B3=5&amp;C3=6&amp;A4=6&amp;B4=3&amp;C4=5&amp;A5=4&amp;B5=6&amp;C5=4&amp;A6=5&amp;B6=6&amp;C6=2&amp;A7=2&amp;B7=4&amp;C7=5&amp;A8=6&amp;B8=6&amp;C8=2&amp;A9=2&amp;B9=5&amp;C9=6&amp;A10=2&amp;B10=5&amp;C10=2&amp;A11=1&amp;B11=6&amp;C11=6&amp;A12=3&amp;B12=3&amp;C12=2&amp;A13=2&amp;B13=4&amp;C13=3&amp;A14=4&amp;B14=2&amp;C14=6&amp;A15=6&amp;B15=6&amp;C15=3&amp;A16=1&amp;B16=2&amp;C16=5&amp;A17=2&amp;B17=2&amp;C17=3&amp;A18=1&amp;B18=2&amp;C18=4&amp;A19=2&amp;B19=6&amp;C19=6&amp;A20=2&amp;B20=6&amp;C20=2) quiz. Upon its completion, I received this message

&gt;You scored 36.667 out of 100 masculine points, 56.667 out of 100 feminine points, and 50 out of 100 androgynous (neutral) points.

I bring all of this up because, following a long ""drought"" I was feeling particularly femme for longer than the few hours that I had previously been used to, and, it had been so long since those feelings had come about that I was confused at first when I noticed them. Anyway, they were really pleasant and, while they were there, I really wished I had a dress to put on or something. Unfortunately, the way things are, it would be deemed very inappropriate, and, even if it didn't, because of the way the binary is constructed, and ingrained, to dress in a way that deviates, or is deemed deviant (ie, be read as male and wear a dress) is to commit (ie claim that you now want to be perceived in a particular permanently.) I guess since I feel very nebulous about the situation, I do not want to dress a particular way, thus making a declaration of sorts, only to retract later.

In the short time that I have been on this sub, I have read about similar experiences others have had, which seem very similar to mine. I hope that maybe some who have, or are currently dealing with something similar might be able to provide me with insight or strategies they've used, or are trying, to navigate this...confusion? Uncertainty? Whatever. Thank you in advance to those who take the time to read this and to those who decide to respond. I appreciate it, and I appreciate you.

All in all I figured it was a pretty basic autochorrisexual experience, until gay furry porn, which very often features extremely feminine men, began to interest me, in such a way that it became my go to thing for sexual release instead of straight art.

 Now at first I thought it was simply because those boys were so girly and not even human to begin with that my brain couldn't tell the difference. But the more I browsed the more introspection I forced upon myself. I figured out rather early on that I didn't just like looking at girly furry dudes, I wanted to be one, I wanted to be someone's little sub, their toy, to be called a girl and thrown around. Only, I never could figure out if this was a desire that existed In real life or should stay in my head like most things of this nature.

I had heard a lot about sexual roleplay from my friends in the furry community, at first I was hesitant because there was still another person there, even if I couldn't see them, but eventually I got past my anxieties and loaded up Omegle one afternoon, ""18/yo,Bi, M, red fox"" I said when my partner asked for my species and orientation, my character had yet to take proper shape back then, my partner was a big, dominant bear.

My hands were so sweaty I felt I could Short my keyboard, but I had written some erotica privately before and it couldn't be too much different... and it really wasn't, I told him my preferences and he threw me on the bed and owned me. whispering into my fuzzy ears, about how I was such a good ""girl"". It was literally my first sexual experience of any kind with another human being and, slightly misanthropic, asexual-identifying me, had to admit... I really liked it.

In the weeks after that, I RP,d any moment I could, my character evolved and I woke up a latent crossdressing fetish i always suspected, I was put in miniskirts and on a leash, slapped and called all kinds of nasty names, and I loved it.

Fellow who has recently started growing facial hair at a decent rate and who can't gain a single pound.

I've unfortunately grown to be shocked and disturbed by my own body in recent months, I can't reconcile my personality with this body, I remember once I tried to shave my legs just to help a little. But the blade was dull and I had prickly feelings all day instead of smoothness. I came to loathe the idea of masculine and feminine things being seperate even more than I already had, and for better or worse, nearly worshipping androgyny as a concept and the highest thing I could attain. One of my friends is beautifully androgynous and as much as Iove him, I do get pangs of jealousy.

I can't stop thinking about how I could possibly look more androgynous without worrying my family, they already suspect some kind of eating disorder because I'm just very skinny. I really don't think I count as transgender. I feel the opposite of a strong inclination towards one side or the other, I just hate having this hairy body and square-ish face structure, doesn't feel like me and is leaving me very, very confused.

Perhaps I've rambled, but I needed to get this internal struggle out somehow, I hope I don't come off as ignorant or unnecessary.

I have a model I'm interested in getting but the D cups are sold out everywhere, which is what I had initially been planning on getting because the rule of thumb I hear is ""if you're over 6 feet, D is about right"" so now I'm trying to choose between C or E cups.

I am a biological female who loves women. I’ve been having confused thoughts about my gender since about 1 and a half year ago, although I always knew I wasn’t the classic girl/woman/whatever. I haven’t talked to anyone about this yet, please be kind, I need help.

At first it was my body, my very feminine hips especially. But now, now things have taken a weird turn. 

In the past 12 months I got my heart broken twice. The first time it was from a woman I was totally crazy for, who unfortunately for my “lesbian-presenting” self was straight, and kept teasing me while I was desperately lost for her. The second time, it was from a bi girl, who left me for totally different reasons. 

The point is: in both this relationships I felt that things would have been different if I was a man. With the first one I kept thinking to myself that if I was a man we would be dating for sure and happy, and all of the suffering that I was going through would have not happened. When I was with the second girl I used to think something like: “well she’s bi, so she can love me even if a become a man”.

Today, about a month after the second girl broke up with me, I saw a woman give birth at the hospital where I work. After the baby was born the nurse brought the baby to her face and you could fill the love in the room. The thing is: this girl reminded me so much of my ex, that is was painful to watch. I had to step away. At that moment a thought crossed my mind that I will never be able to get any girl pregnant, because I am not a man and I never will be. And this just augmented the pain. 

I don’t know what to make of all of this. I don’t know if I only have these thoughts because I am heartbroken, or because truly I am trans, or non binary or somewhere I still can identify in the gender spectrum. 

I am so scared of talking about this with anyone in my life, because I am not sure they will understand. I don’t live in a country where this is an argument of discussion at all.

78,2018-01-12 05:15:05,7puet7,21,9,"I am amab, have been on hrt for 14 months. I came out as a trans woman and started my transition about a year and half ago when I was 29, I will be 31 soon.

I thought that was it though, I am amab and grew up and was well into adult with everyone I knew, myself included, thinking I was, in fact, male.

I obviously realized that wasn't true, I realized that I am transgender.

**COOL**

Well now what? I thought at the time. I rushed into hrt, rushed into all of it and you know what? I love the changes. I recently changed my legal name and gender marker so even the govt recognized me as female even when my family doesn't.

**WEIRD**

But now here I am, questioning my gender again. I'll be honest, I don't understand nonbinary genders. I just don't. I respect it and I've known enbies and never had issue using gender neutral language and pronouns. That's easy but I still don't understand the gender.

And yet somehow I'm starting think that I might be nonbinary. I love that my body now has most of the qualities of a typical female body. I love my curves and my breasts and my softness. I love the changes in my facial features. I love that I smile more now. I love that I cry more now. When I get to have srs one day, I will love my new parts.
***
And that is what confuses me. How can I be nonbinary if I love the features of my body that are specific to a binary gender? But I remember the first time someone asked me my pronouns. I remember the conflict I felt. Sitting in a coffee shop at a bdsm munch, having been out to everyone in my life and no one questioning my femaleness ever.

And I think no one ever asked me my pronouns because I was obviously female...right? But I honestly hesitated after the question and very nearly said she/her they/them. But I didn't, just stuck to the female pronouns.

I was excited at first to pass as female to complete strangers. I was excited to wear things like skirts and dresses and see a very feminine figure in the mirror. But that wore off and now when I dress very femme, it just feels wrong.
***
I find myself most comfortable when wearing more androgynous clothing like jeans, a tank top, leather jacket, and chucks. Like everything I'm wearing but the shoes might be women's clothing but it's definitely not femme.

But when I dress like that I feel awesome and bad ass and confident. For a while, since I am also a lesbian, I thought that maybe I could give the whole butch aesthetic a try but the idea of wearing purposely masculine clothing makes me feel dysphoric.

I also almost kinda feel like it'd be cool be like a pre-pubescent person again. Like, that sounds weird I know and I hope this isn't creepy. I hope at least someone here might understand. I remember being very thin and baby-faced and having the features of an adolescent but not an adult...and I liked that. I still want to have sex and be sexual which is why the idea of being physically like someone who is pre-pubescent kinda creeps myself out.

But like, I wanna be an adult child...I guess? Fuck I don't even know. But aside from breasts, I like the idea of not having characteristics associated with either gender. I don't mind people seeing me as female even if that's inaccurate though.

So I guess the big question is: Can I be a nonbinary gender but still want a body that is visibly female? Can I be nonbinary and not have a strong desire for gender neutral pronouns?

I came out as a trans woman and started my transition about a year and half ago when I was 29, I will be 31 soon.\n\nI thought that was it though, I am amab and grew up and was well into adult with everyone I knew, myself included, thinking I was, in fact, male.\n\nI obviously realized that wasn't true, I realized that I am transgender.\n\n**COOL**\n\nWell now what? I thought at the time. I rushed into hrt, rushed into all of it and you know what? I love the changes. I recently changed my legal name and gender marker so even the govt recognized me as female even when my family doesn't.\n\n**WEIRD**\n\nBut now here I am, questioning my gender again. I'll be honest, I don't understand nonbinary genders. I just don't. I respect it and I've known enbies and never had issue using gender neutral language and pronouns. That's easy but I still don't understand the gender.\n\nAnd yet somehow I'm starting think that I might be nonbinary. I love that my body now has most of the qualities of a typical female body. I love my curves and my breasts and my softness. I love the changes in my facial features. I love that I smile more now. I love that I cry more now. When I get to have srs one day, I will love my new parts.\n***\nAnd that is what confuses me. How can I be nonbinary if I love the features of my body that are specific to a binary gender? But I remember the first time someone asked me my pronouns. I remember the conflict I felt. Sitting in a coffee shop at a bdsm munch, having been out to everyone in my life and no one questioning my femaleness ever.\n\nAnd I think no one ever asked me my pronouns because I was obviously female...right? But I honestly hesitated after the question and very nearly said she/her they/them. But I didn't, just stuck to the female pronouns.\n\nI was excited at first to pass as female to complete strangers. I was excited to wear things like skirts and dresses and see a very feminine figure in the mirror. But that wore off and now when I dress very femme, it just feels wrong.\n***\nI find myself most comfortable when wearing more androgynous clothing like jeans, a tank top, leather jacket, and chucks. Like everything I'm wearing but the shoes might be women's clothing but it's definitely not femme.\n\nBut when I dress like that I feel awesome and bad ass and confident. For a while, since I am also a lesbian, I thought that maybe I could give the whole butch aesthetic a try but the idea of wearing purposely masculine clothing makes me feel dysphoric.\n\nI also almost kinda feel like it'd be cool be like a pre-pubescent person again. Like, that sounds weird I know and I hope this isn't creepy. I hope at least someone here might understand.

Obviously this one is correct for me, but feel free to re-use, change etc to match you.

***So, /u/Kuttle just told you they're non-binary!***

Some questions you might have:

**Q. What the heck does non-binary mean?**

A. From the Gender Wiki (gender.wikia.com):

*“Non-binary gender (see also genderqueer) describes any gender identity which does not fit the male and female binary.”*

All gender is a performance, so instead of following someone else’s script, I’m writing my own.

**Q. So what gender are you?**

A. I don’t feel comfortable identifying (or being identified) with any gender.

**Q. Since when?**

A. For many years now I’ve felt uncomfortable being referred to in terms of the gender binary. I’ve used the term non-binary when thinking about myself for about a year.

**Q. Does this change how I talk about you?**

A. Only a little. I use *they* pronouns, for example:
 
*“Is /u/Kuttle here yet?”*

*“I don’t think they’ve arrived yet. They’re not at their desk.”*

It also means you should use non-gendered language, such as “child” instead of son/daughter, “sibling” instead of brother/sister, etc.

**Q. But society categorises people into man or woman / but what about “biological sex” and chromosomes / but my religion says…**

A. I understand that western culture is really hung up on categorising people into either male or female (some other cultures not so much). Gender non-conformity is about stepping outside those things, saying “that isn’t me” and just being who you are without these societal expectations.

**Q. So this a just political thing?**

A. Any gender issue is considered political, so sure. But I didn’t think “You know what, I’m going to fight the patriarchy by changing my gender identity!” What I did think was “This is a thing I’ve been feeling for a really long time and now I’ve worked out what words I want to use to describe it.”

**Q. Are you changing anything about yourself?**

A. You might notice changes in my clothing and other things like hair or makeup.

**Q. Are you still gay?**

A. That one’s kind of complicated. Words like “gay” and “straight” only work within a gender binary.

Bit of background: 
I’m AMAB, NB, present (physically) entirely masculine/male - I even have a beard. I wear trousers. I don’t wear makeup. However I do not identify as male or female, and I prefer they/them/their pronouns.

Most of my friends and family are aware of this, however they continue to use male pronouns for me - this doesn’t tend to offend me as I know there is no malicious intent. 

My partner considers herself a heterosexual woman. The fact that she’s with me does challenge that somewhat, and it’s something we discuss from time to time, however she doesn’t think it makes any difference - it’s a “I’m with you, and that’s all that matters” kind of thing. 

So we present to the world as a heterosexual couple, one male, one female, but just to be clear - I am a non-binary person.

Now we come to the fun part: we are in our 30s and are now at the time of our lives when a lot of our friends are getting married. And time and time again, we are being invited to gendered events. 
I can’t help but feel a little offended, and even misgendered, by being invited to an all-male event, whilst at the same time I appreciate that my friends might have felt equally awkward about not inviting me. 
Meanwhile my SO is in a bind, because she doesn’t really want to go to an all-female event either, however feels immense pressure to go and be girly.

So... the most recent time I was invited on a stag weekend, I simply said that I wouldn’t be coming. I didn’t make any excuses up, I simply said I wouldn’t feel comfortable at an all-male event, thanks for the invite, nothing personal etc. I tried not to make it all about me - and tried not to offend him. He took it really well actually, although he was disappointed that I wouldn’t be attending, he totally appreciated my honesty.

And now, the weekend is upon us. My SO and I just had an impassioned discussion about it, but ultimately she chose to go and is at the girls event right now. (Needless to say, I was not invited to that).

I am sitting here feeling a whole load of things: I feel disappointed and let-down by my partner, whilst I respect her decision to go to this thing, I can’t help but feel unsupported by her.

So... apologies for the very long message. I have no NB friends in my life, so wondering if anyone out there can share how they have dealt with these tricky situations.

When I first met this person they mentioned in passing they might be non-binary, but female pronouns were fine. I tried to still refer to them as ""them"" as much as I could, just to be respectful. 

Some time passed and they expressed dysphoria over female pronouns and ranted about they wished all their friends wouldn't gender them female. I was the one who suggested they insist on others using ""they"" and correct them if anyone used ""she"" instead of shrugging and dying instead when others say ""she"". 

Some more time passed, and after doing the insisting on ""they"" pronouns, they go to their families house for the holidays and said they came out to family, all of which completely invalided their existence. Almost right after that, this shift happened from non binary to gender fluid. I figure, using your name and ""they"" is still fine since it's kinda of a safe option when referring to anyone. Well, not exactly. 

Now they ""feel a gender coming on"" and ""switch"" and want me and everyone else to change names AND pronouns (neutral to male and back, female is never okay) depending on how they think they're changing their voice. 

 I suggested having a reversible name tag so that when they feel the switch, we could switch over based on the tag. They don't want to do that and say it *so* obvious that the voice is switching. They also express a lot dysphoria at being gendered female initially by strangers.

I tried suggesting this being the case, but I'm met with a hard NOPE, followed by ranting of how I want to put them in a gender box like their family, just the opposite one, and now appears angry at me.

Addon: I'd probably replace the 'female, but!' with 'female, and!'

Edit: I'm fine with labels, and I'm trying to figure out which ones might fit. It was my therapist who has a vendetta against labels.
---
The long short of it is this; I've been questioning my gender for awhile, and I'm wavering between genderqueer/nonbinary and simply being a cis who's over thinking things.



I don't know where to begin with this. I think my main issue with figuring out my identity is that I am comfortable being seen/identified as a female; however there has been a 'but!' on the end of this sentence for a long time, probably since freshman year [I'm out of HS now]. 



For quite awhile I've had the thought of ""It would be nice if people could see me as female, but! also not"" or ""I want to be female, but! also not"". A convoluted internal conversation where I struggle with the fact that while I'm AFAB and I don't particularly fight against that, yet I do disagree. But not completely. If I was having a conversation with an other world entity and they were like, hey pass the sugar, also what's your gender? I'd say ""I'm female+, like, female but also not?""



A few years ago (like, age 16) I went through a sexual trauma that sent my life into a very weird place. I was 100% sure I wasn't cis. I bought a binder- and wore it- I dressed neutral as possible (I've always had a large chest and hips), and I even went so far as having some people refer to me with he/him or they/them.



But then it... changed?



I finally started processing my trauma, and the feelings just... calmed down. My feelings of 'female, and!' didn't go away completely, but I kind of invalidated myself and said my entire experience was because of my trauma, I'm 10p% cis, stop trying to be a special snowflake.



But the problem is back again? Again, after years of internal silence, I'm having these thoughts of being female+. Of wanting to be. Of wanting to be seen by other people as female, but!



I've reached out to my closest friend about this, and they have been very supportive. They're a binary trans person themself, which is part of why I went to them, thinking they would have some opinions? Maybe? 



They've pointed out that it doesn't really line up, to them, that I still want to be female. At least partially. And that I have 0 desires to me a man or be masculine. And just. Well, it's put a strain on things, and I regret bringing the topic up.



I tried speaking with an older therapist of mine, who's also a certified gender therapist. They're very against labels and essentially our entire conversation was them going ""Why do you think about these labels? Call yourself gender experimental! Call yourself 'Gender Weird'!"" and basically. TL;DR: I wanted help laying out the pieces of my puzzle, not be given bags to put the pieces in.



I'm just. I just spend my days flip flopping on myself. One day I'm confident that yes, I'm genderqueer! It is a relief to call myself that! Isn't it great that I've finally figured out part of the puzzle?



And then there are the days after, where I wake up feeling sick at the idea that I've actually told people I'm questioning my gender, feeling nothing but absolute guilt at opening this door because why would I? Aren't I Just A Girl? I'm cis, there's nothing else to it! I should never have started this conversation! What an embarrassing waste of peoples' time.



But there's. Just. Growing up, I wasn't particularly attached to either gender. I recognize that now. I was raised in a very accepting and welcoming home, with parents who have made mistakes from ignorance, not malice. Child me would wear dresses one day, and a shirt with bugs glued to it the next. Who cared? I was a small child. But I would also insist, fervently, that blue was my favorite color, because I knew that's a ~boy thing, and I wanted to be a bit more like a boy.



Skip ahead a few years, and now I'm at the age everyone else starts dressing up, getting training bras, and exploring makeup. I didn't care. At all. I had way more important things going on, and I remember being very uncomfortable with my body's developments. Makeup was something I thought was silly, felt gross, and looked wrong on me. But most of all, I disliked 'dressing nice'. Dress felt fake. I felt like a fraud. Like a mistake. Wearing heels made me feel panic. 'Makeup' was unnatural and anxiety inducing.



I avoided dressing up for quite a few years.



Skip ahead more time. Now I've begun to force myself to wear dresses, skirts, asking to be bought push up bras because obviously large breasts are what I should aspire to have. A bit of makeup, though I'm yet to get any good at it. Yet it still feels wrong. I feel panicky and gross when wearing dresses. 'Dressing up' isn't enjoyable, it makes me want to cry.



However, I am a girl, duh! Thus I should like this. I should wear these things. So I forced myself to.



More years ahead. I have a makeup collection, and have gotten pretty good at it! I dress extremely feminine some days. I own several heels. I've forced myself to dress up and warp my closet to the point it's not really an option anymore. And I think I made myself numb? I just made myself numb to the discomfort; I want to wear a straight cut jacket with nice pants and a stylish tie, but instead I wear fancy dresses and heels. Because. Just. It's how things ~should be, y'know?



I know part of me is female. I know that. I accept that. That is an important part of my identity. But something else feels... off. Not every day. But some days. Some days I get Dressed Up and put on fancy makeup and wear heels and feel good. And then some days I do that and I feel sick. I want nothing but to scrub my face raw, tear the clothes off and toss out all of the makeup and all of the dresses, and just hide in my bed.



Except that's just. A really dramatic and honest version of it, since I scold myself whenever I have those feelings. Whenever I feel like that I force myself to just get through it.



I don't really know what this post is anymore?

Just.



Does anyone else feel this way? Please. I've been trying to find forums and posts and threads and just someone else who talks about 'Female+' but it seems you have to feel masculine/male at some point to truly not be a cis woman, but it's never been that way. It's always female and. Female + neutral.



Am I just? A confused cis female who's maybe gender nonconforming, not gender queer?

A confused cis female who\'s maybe gender nonconforming, not gender queer?\n---\n\nThat\'s the post I made.\n\nTo be honest, I kinda felt relief when I found out about genderqueer/nonbinary identities.

207,2018-01-29 15:52:29,7tt6r2,6,12,"Hey guys.
A couple of days ago, it was my one-year anniversary of discovering I was trans-gendered and that though being AMAB, my traditional presentation no longer reflected my inner self. I wasn't comfortable wandering around as purely masculine anymore. 
However, a year on and I'm still having severe doubts as to my appearance. I could use some advice from the wonderful fonts of wisdom which are these subreddits. 

I identify as non-binary/androgynous. I once came across a label: 'masculine-androgen' and it resonated so beautifully in my understanding that I almost leaped to my feet and cheered at the time. To put numbers on it, I feel only 65% or so masculine if that makes sense, my feminine-self taking a less significant but undeniable chunk of space in my identity. The issue Ive been having is how to do justice to this new pillar of my identity. I am the only non-binary individual that I know of in my circle. All of my trans friends and family members are firmly in the binary. I've managed to cobble together core components to my appearance that make me feel comfortable but with no other NB people to speak to/compare notes with, I don't know if... I don't know whether I'm doing it wrong or not. Does that make sense? I suppose it doesn't when I come to think about it because everyone has their own unique outlook. But I really get uncomfortable wondering if everyone sees me as a circus.

A brief description may be in order. The biggest components of my look are my breast forms. They were the element I knew from the get-go that were non-negotiable and which I needed to feel like the real me. They're matched to my build (maybe a little smaller) so they're not over-the-top (at least I don't think so). I'm growing my hair long and wear it in a ponytail and usually have a non-descript hairband in. On special occasions, I have a bow or colourful hairclips in or something, but only in and around the house. I shave as close as I possibly can but ultimately, I'm cursed with a very masculine frame (6 foot tall, large build, wide shoulders, strong core. I used to play rugby once upon a time so perhaps that gives you an idea what I'm forced to work with). 
I try to wear more feminine colours, tones, and styles to try and dilute the masculinity out a bit but it's really tough.

At a quick glance from the street, I suspect I appear as a ""bloke with boobs"" and I'm not especially happy with that due to the frequent looks and occasional abuse I get from strangers. I'm sure things can be refined, evened out. 

How do you present? Am I unique in my current attempts? Any advice on clothing styles to explore etc? Does anyone have any stories which run in the same lanes as my own experiences?

My dad regularly jokes that trans people should be encouraged to commit suicide and shit like that. I currently live with him because he is a better person than my mom on all fronts. They both abused me when I was young and my mom still does now when given a chance.

I'm very aware of how hard it is to live as someone who identifies as they/them/very publicly third gender and I know that's just not for me. I live in a very conservative region and I don't think I could maintain that identity and my safety. 

I knew I was nb for years, but I never told anyone. This summer I came out to my boyfriend and my close friends. I told them I was in a sort of ""walk in closet"" where to anyone other than them I was female, but I'd be out to anyone who I was moderately close to socially. This was going great. I was saving up money to get a binder, my boyfriend was 100% accepting and so were my friends. They all understood I wanted to be both male and non binary. They even started using male pronouns. Then things got bad.

I was illegally evicted from the place I was living and was forced to move back in with my dad, who lives far away from my friends and boyfriend. The area is hyper-conservative and incredibly rural. I told my loved ones I was putting my transition on the back burner. They switched back my pronouns and I promised myself I wouldn't try to pass male in public like I had been doing. It was crushing for me. 

I'm finding once having a taste of being out that I can't go back. I pass as male by accident all the time and have used men's restrooms, which I never did before i was evicted. I want to buy an stp and a binder. I want it all so bad, but I know if my dad caught on I'd be in worlds of hurt. Does anyone have tips for what would help me deal with this emotionally?

I live in a very conservative region and I don\'t think I could maintain that identity and my safety. \n\nI knew I was nb for years, but I never told anyone. This summer I came out to my boyfriend and my close friends. I told them I was in a sort of ""walk in closet"" where to anyone other than them I was female, but I\'d be out to anyone who I was moderately close to socially. This was going great. I was saving up money to get a binder, my boyfriend was 100% accepting and so were my friends. They all understood I wanted to be both male and non binary. They even started using male pronouns. Then things got bad.\n\nI was illegally evicted from the place I was living and was forced to move back in with my dad, who lives far away from my friends and boyfriend. The area is hyper-conservative and incredibly rural. I told my loved ones I was putting my transition on the back burner. They switched back my pronouns and I promised myself I wouldn\'t try to pass male in public like I had been doing. It was crushing for me. \n\nI\'m finding once having a taste of being out that I can\'t go back. I pass as male by accident all the time and have used men\'s restrooms, which I never did before i was evicted. I want to buy an stp and a binder. I want it all so bad, but I know if my dad caught on I\'d be in worlds of hurt. Does anyone have tips for what would help me deal with this emotionally? Is there any way I can just subtly transition without him noticing? I\'m terrified and I don\'t know anyone trans who can help.

Anyway that’s just a fact that I know, and I’ve always known. Still, when I have tried to tell anyone they just don’t believe me. Nobody ever have. I’ve been told I’m just another chick who wants to hang out with the guys, or that I want to be a special snowflake. 

I live in a liberal country that is not educated enough about the trans community. So everyone think they are accepting while in reality they really aren’t. At least not in my case.

But I’m okay with feminine pronouns and I can accept having a female body. At least for the most part. My true dysphoria is socially. I can’t stand it when someone expects me to act feminine, or when other people gender me socially. I live in a male dominated world (I study computer science) and I have to prove myself twice as much to earn half the recognition. And if I don’t act modest and timid then a lot of men tend to be disrespectful towards me. Asshats. They expect me to be so freakin caring and bat my eyelashes at them when I really want to call them an effin dickbag for treating me like their secretary. I’m not sure if this is a problem for all genders, or if it’s even gender related. But I hear a lot of women complaint about similiar things, so I draw my conclusions.

So just because no one believes me I’ve considered just not coming out at all. The only thing I would REALLY want to change is my name, but I can’t really do that since the name I’d choose is 99.9% male name from Finland (I wonder who that 0,1% person was) and it would be weird for other people to call me that unless I transitioned completely. So I’m going to just do my own thing, then. I’m going to act and dress masculine when I feel like it, or even feminine if I want to. I don’t need to explain myself, as it’s nobody’s buisness.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, I pretended to be a woman online to get some attention (I know... I feel terrible). It worked and I ended up conversing online with a couple of people ""as a girl"". I would do it wearing a dress and some pantyhose for no real reason.

I want to go shopping, get a nice dress, some nice shoes, some makeup, and then go out wearing them and feeling pretty.    

&amp;nbsp;

But I'm scared, I'm scared of what people would think, what my friends, my family, my coworkers would think...

I'm also scared, it's just a phase, a minor crisis, and it'll pass. I don't want to make any hasty decisions that I might regret down the road...    
I'm confused, I don't really know who I am anymore, and that scares me, especially since I have nobody to talk to about it.

AMAB. For a while now I’ve had this thought pop up in my head from time to time. “Ya know, self, you’ve never really liked your gender. You’ve always thought of it as something foisted upon you. Resented that even. Ever considered that you might be trans?” And I’d smile and nod. “Good thought, self, there are some solid points there and it warrants more consideration” and I’d put the topic aside and merrily go about my life for a while until it popped up again.

A few days ago it was cold outside and I was bitching about it to an online friend when she responded with something like “Girl, go get a sweater!”. She doesn’t know me in real life, I don’t have any pictures of my face online, and I choose not to display my gender. She might not even know that I present male and so this wasn’t a joke, I was being mis-gendered. But my reaction to being mis-gendered was not neutral, it was positive. Being referred to as a girl somehow felt good. “Hey self, why does this feel good?” . . . “OH, FUCK ME” Then a bomb went off inside my head.

Since then I’ve been a wreck. I’ve read enough at this point to realize that the resulting panic is pretty normal. Such as “Oh my god, this can't be happening. This can't be real. You can’t be serious. Stop. Just stop it.” One part of my brain basically running a slideshow of memories of all the things I’ve said, done, or thought that point towards my being trans. The other half of my brain reacting to every word from the first with pitchforks, torches, and crying sessions. In an attempt to resolve the conflict I even started logging them to a spreadsheet. First column: things that point to me being trans. Second column: place for reactionary brain to get out it’s panicking, venting, and curse words. Third column: arguments that I’m not trans. I don’t know if it helped but either way this turns out for me, that spreadsheet is going to be a very amusing read later in life.

And of course the doubts of if this is even real or i’m just losing it. But if there was no validity to the idea i might want to change my gender, then why am I freaking out. If i’m not trans, then why won’t this thought let me go. Why would I be losing sleep over this, and why is there a civil war going on inside my head.

One of the biggest hang ups i’ve had is that so much of the narrative around transitioning, at least from the outside, is ‘becoming who you really are’ and ‘leaving your old self behind’. That being trans is going to change _everything_ and you should be happy about it. But even if you’re not happy with your current life, that is a massive bucket of anomie to dump on someone. There is a fear that things won’t be better, sure, but there is also a (to me, greater) fear of losing yourself along the way. That who you are will no longer be recognizable in who you are to become.

But there is a response to that which shows up in basically every thread, it just took a while to get through to me. I don’t actually have to do anything about these feelings. That its OK to feel them and act or not act on them as I choose. That i could say, “I really love low color saturation and that’s not manly but so what fuck you”, and still also say “You know what, eyeliner is really just too much right now. No, I don’t want to do that”

I still don’t know what trans is or what it means on a personal level. I still don’t know. And part of me is still calling this whole thing an absurd dream that I will wake up from at some point. I do know I’ll try experimenting with clothing a bit. Maybe dig up my good looking earrings and nail polish.* But that’s it. That’s all. I’ve done more for a Rocky Horror showing than just that. But then it was a ‘game’ and this time its real. Does this make me trans? No, maybe, but mostly who cares. If I like it then i’ll keep doing it. If I don’t then I’ll stop. If I want to do more I’ll do more. What label people want to put on that doesn’t really matter right now. That word is no longer a threat to me.

As a bit of an aside, I think the trans community can improve how it deals with prior selves. Deadnames, dead identities, that prior selves are dead. I understand why people think and why people feel that way. I understand that for some people that is explicitly the point, or is a lynchpin in how you think about transitioning. And I’m not objecting. But at least for me and perhaps people like me, I need to be able to draw a contiguous line from who I was, to who I am, to where I’m going. So if trans is the way i’m going, and I don’t know that yet, then the current me doesn’t have to die to get there.

Just change a little.

There is no way, shape, or form my legal name is unisex. I've read a few places online that you don't *have* to use your legal name on a resume, but you will be required to provide it for background checks.


My chubby, baby face doesn't let me pass, but my voice has dropped, and I'm having to shave my face almost daily. So I don't want to go in to interviews with a girly name, and then open my mouth and the interviewer is like ""where is the ventriloquist??""


I don't want them to really see me as a ""trans man"" I just want them to see me as a guy hoping to get a job with their company. I don't want to get deadnamed, and misgendered. 


Then I keep thinking I don't want to """"""trick"""""" a potential employer by using a name that isn't legal (yet).


If I use my legal name when applying, when is an appropriate time to tell them ""hey, I know my name is legally this, but this will be my name and these are my pronouns""? 
In the interview? After the interview? When I have the job so I can burst through the doors, reeking of Axe^tm body spray and shout ""you have been bamboozled""?

So I don\'t want to go in to interviews with a girly name, and then open my mouth and the interviewer is like ""where is the ventriloquist??""\n\n\nI don\'t want them to really see me as a ""trans man"" I just want them to see me as a guy hoping to get a job with their company. I don\'t want to get deadnamed, and misgendered. \n\n\nThen I keep thinking I don\'t want to """"""trick"""""" a potential employer by using a name that isn\'t legal (yet).\n\n\nIf I use my legal name when applying, when is an appropriate time to tell them ""hey, I know my name is legally this, but this will be my name and these are my pronouns""? \nIn the interview? After the interview? When I have the job so I can burst through the doors, reeking of Axe^tm body spray and shout ""you have been bamboozled""?\n\n\nI\'m just panicking a little, and not really sure what to do.

So you post up a long list of all the things you think might or might not mean you’re trans, begging for validation. And the internet happily obliges. Some people will say yes, some people will say no. But please don’t listen to them because here’s the thing, no one can tell you.


Let’s play a game. I want you to ask me to tell you what your favorite color is. Say to me “What is my favorite color?” Go ahead, ask. 


I don’t know.


If I were a street performer, I would look to see if you’re wearing blue, green, or purple, and if so tell you green, blue, or purple. Because statistically most people have one of those as favorites, and if you are presenting one of those colors it’s enough to make a guess. But it’s still a guess, and you’re not happy with that answer so you tell me stories about all of the times you’ve been wearing green but saw something blue that you really really wanted. Or that your parents like it when you wear green and you liked making them happy. Or the time you took a green thing and painted it purple. And that time that you were wearing yellow and were just happy wearing yellow. So you tell me stories and stories and stories and again ask me “Please tell me, I really need your help right now. What is my favorite color?”


I don’t know.


I’m not you and I can’t see inside your head. With every story you told there’s an undercurrent of emotion and related thoughts that will never be conveyed by words alone. So the most someone can get from your stories is a shadow play of what you truly feel. Not enough to come to a conclusion. And beyond that, human memory is just kinda shitty at remembering things. Shocking, I know.


So asking us will never be able to tell you what *your* answer should be to something as fundamental as who you are. And anyone who tries to tell you with confidence who you are is just being an asshole.


But please. PLEASE. Keep asking.


Current estimates place the trans population at roughly 0.5% of the general population. That sounds small, doesn’t it. But that’s 1 in 200 people. I easily pass 200 people on my way to work each day. And when compared to the populations of regions, nations, the world itself… There are millions of trans people out there. And they all know how hard this is.


No matter how frightened or angry or depressed or conflicted you’re feeling, millions of people have stood where you’re standing right now. Millions of people have been there and know exactly what you’re feeling. And an untold number more have also questioned and decided that they don’t need to change.


So we know how important this is to you and we’re right here. You. are. not. alone.


I may not be able to tell you if you like blue or green or yellow or purple or no color or a color that we don’t yet have a word for. But I want to hear from you. I want to learn from and connect with you. Trans or Cis or LGB or anywhere in the alphabet soup, I want you to feel safe, welcome, and happy. I want to hear, *from you*, who you are.

I'm not really feeling the ""this isn't right and I hate my body"" kind of dysphoria. I'm just really angry that this is what I have and it's wrong- most of the time anyway. Sometimes it's the other kind.
I mean, things are decent. I sleep a lot, or I want to sleep a lot. Either one. Mom tells me I'm anorexic but I'm suffering depression and dysphoria and not dysmorphia. 
I guess this is more like a journal entry... Maybe I'll make more?
I don't think anyone really gets inside a trans teen's head, just a random thought.
I turn 18 this year, I'm excited. 
Does this count as a personal agenda?
If someone tells you that they can't use your preferred name or pronous, ask then why they can't. I mean, they have a mouth, vocal cords (assuming they're not mute). They can call you what you want to be called, they just won't. Why don't you just be un-apologetically you? 
What I'm saying is you need to forget about anyone who will forget about you. I  had to disown a toxic family member and I want whatever trans human that is reading this to know- don't be afraid to let people go. Sometimes you have to or you forget how to be you under all of that worrying to please this person that you could just let go.

97,2018-01-15 03:52:29,7qh3tk,13,1,"So, I'm a cis writer. I have family connections with the queer community, but no personal friends who are trans -- so I'm asking Reddit. 

I'm writing a novel in which one of the minor characters (""Jene"") is a transwoman. She's about 29 years old.  She's my main character's best friend, and they've been close since high school. 

Here are my questions: 
The story doesn't discuss Jene's transition, but at age 29 she's pretty well-put-together and self-confident. My main character, who's a cis straight woman a couple years younger, really admires Jene for her strength and certainty about life. Jene makes a few references to her past struggles, but her personal history is not the focus of the scenes where she shows up. 

So one question I have is: I'm aware of what an odyssey it is for someone to transition. Is it reasonable to present someone who is 29 years old and has really put her life together in a good strong way? Or would a person of that age inevitably still be struggling with the whole giant life-change of transition? Jene is a professional photographer, an energetic dancer, single at the moment but gregarious and pretty engaged with life. She lives in Seattle, so she's got a good community environment. 

I guess a related question would be: What are the main challenges facing transwomen who are already transitioned? Maybe dating? Or contemplating options for future parenthood? 

My second question is: My main character, Bridget, was a shy girl in high school who loved chess and sci fi and all things digital, so she hung out with the nerds. Jene (who was Gene back then) was seen as a weird kid because he was struggling with feeling like a girl, and the two of them became buddies. The friendship only strengthened as Gene transitioned to Jene. Is there any reason why this sort of friendship would seem improbable?

In general, is there anything I should be aware of in creating a trans character?

Some of my earliest memories are of myself starting kindergarten and crying myself to sleep at night because I felt like god (who I then believed in) had messed up by making me a boy when I should have been a girl. I can remember asking god if I could spend even one day as a girl I would trade away the rest of my life for that one day. I never told anyone about that until about two years ago I told my long term 6+ year girlfriend how I have always felt I was born the wrong sex and she was very supportive. She isnt in the picture anymore because of unrelated reasons, so I'm back to basically being the only person in my life who knows how I really feel about myself.  I'm only attracted to women, so I guess I kind of wished I could have been a lesbian in what would have been my ideal reality. I have never had any personal desire to transition to female, even though I support people who want to and if it brings them happiness then I am truly happy for them, but for myself I think it would just make me feel even more outcast, I am very masculine looking and at this point I dont think any amount of surgery would ever make me feel outside like I've always wanted to be inside. I wish that I had told my father when I was a child how I felt, my dad has always been the only supportive loving person in my life, He doesnt know about this but I know he would have understood and maybe I could have been put on puberty blockers or something until I was old enough to decide, I think that would have been the only scenario I would have considered transitioning. As it stands now though I already hate being alone and have always kind of hated who I am, the best I am currently hoping for is to find love with a woman who will accept me for who I am, on the one hand alot of the women I have been with have ended up really falling for me, especially before I started admitting to myself about my identity issues, I think due to how I tend to be very sensitive and deeply emotional in relationships but on the other hand its harder to find someone accepting of my sexual needs and desires that I attribute to my gender identity, I really enjoy getting to be submissive to the women I'm with and receiving anal play from them, and there is a stigma about guys receiving anal as being gay which is unfortunately thought by a lot of people, even though for me its been a sexual act that allows me to fantasize about getting to receive penetrative sex as a woman, its the closest I have ever come to sexually feeling feminine. 

I read once something along the lines of sometimes during pregnancy the fetus is supposed to be female but can sometimes change to male at the last moment from trauma or drugs or other factors during the pregnancy, leading to it being born a male with higher then normal estrogen levels. I've always had low testosterone levels and my birth mother had drug problems so I kind of suspect that maybe might have been the case with me. I have no way to know that for certain besides the feeling that I was supposed to have been born differently. All I know is I've never felt like I was living the right life, and I wish I could have grown up as a girl, getting to feel pretty, getting asked to dances, discovering being more attracted to other women, getting to experience bearing a child. I dont really know what my point here is, just needed to say some stuff even if no one reads its. It just sucks to feel like this, it has made most of the joy in my life seem pretty hollow when I've always known I would have grown up loving myself and happy with life if only one chromosome had been different...

Over the course of my life, I've acknowledged that I definitely feel more comfortable internally identifying in feminine ways, or as a feminine persona. Hanging around men, I have to ""put on"" a more masculine personality. My friends are by and large, mostly women. I feel much more comfortable in groups of only women, in fact as a child I always found myself in friend groups that consisted mainly of girls. I've done a few gender-identifying personality tests and they always come back predominantly female.

The thing is, I'm totally okay with knowing that who I am inside isn't quite aligned with who I am outside. It might help that others find me quite attractive (going off what I'm told).

In advance I told them why I wanted to come and they told me that they have not much experience but they see no problem in working with me and we'll be fine. 

So I had to go there today just that they can tell me that they don't work with trans people because they have no idea of the topic and they even don't wont to work on that kind of setting...

Did I just wasted nearly two months I could have spent looking for someone suitable because they told me on the phone everything would be fine? :(

With the baseline of me beeing still very confused and not sure if transition is for me, but also with the sometimes spiking urge and feeling of why the hell am I not into the process yet - I want to live within a female body desperately and at the same time fear of making anything worse for me I just feel tired at the moment...

With all the other things I have to take care of at the moment I really have no idea what is keeping me going.

I sometimes think I should just keep not thinking about anything as good as I can and drown myself in work, games and fast food.

Everyone acts like its perfectly acceptable to talk to a mixed gender group with ""ladies"" ""girls"".

Its fucking sickening. I expect this from cis people, people who arn't misgendered on a daily basis, people who don't have dysphoria to hurt them when it happens. I don't expect this from trans people. And go ahead, attack me, I don't fucking care at this point. If you can't handle that trans women CAN do wrong then you're a fucking baby.

I understand its hard to give any empathy to a group of people who have what you want, and don't want what you want.

I get that the trans subs are 20 or more trans women to trans men at this point. But that doesn't make it YOUR space. Its supposed to be a trans space. Quit trying to push us out. Quit acting like we don't deserve shit.

I think the problem is that my chosen first and middle names are both one syllable, and my surname is two.

Both chosen names are gender neutral. My first name is a short version of my birth name; my middle name (which I sometimes go by) is a short, gender neutral name that can be lengthened to a masc name or a fem name, so lengthening it to either of them doesn't feel right.

Separately they work as having two different names that I use around different people. Together, they sound weird and disjointed and I hate it. I thought by having one as a first name and one as a middle name, it would be fine, but nope.

For my whole life, I've had issues with my gender identity. In high school and the beginning of college, I identified as a boy and went by the name Johnny. At that time, schools weren't as good with transgender stuff as they are now, so I remained out to only a handful of people (who disrespected my identity anyway) and was fully out online. Without having an online life where my gender was respected, I probably would have succumbed to my depression. During my second year of college, I met a man who became the reason I socially detransitioned, and I started to feel that being a man wasn't what I was meant to be anyway, and went back to using my birth name, but abbreviated. Once that relationship ended, I had to come to terms with the fact that I was gay, in the sense that I was only into women, as relationships with men made me uncomfortable as well for abuse related reasons. But my uncomfortableness with being seen as either a woman or a man remained, the gender issue was still there and it had no solution. 

Then I discovered the concept of a non-binary identity, and it seemed perfect. I could never look ""gender neutral"" in the sense that other people would be confused about my gender (I'm plus sized and I wear my hair long so it would give it away immediately that I'm DFAB) but even if I changed my name to something more gender neutral (I go by Jay now, socially) and encouraged my girlfriend to use more neutral language when discussing me (partner instead of girlfriend, nice instead of beautiful, things of that nature) I would be overall, okay. 

But the fact is, no one accepts me. And it frustrates me. My girlfriend will use my old name and my new name interchangably, I'm not allowed to come out to her parents because her sibling is also (binary) transgender and it would ""confuse them with the name changes"", my mom uses my chosen name condescendingly when she's angry at me and I'm too nervous to even ask about changing my name ""legally"" in the sense that my school would have me on record as Jay and not my birth name. It's just awful a lot of the times and I don't know how I'm going to get through this, what I'm going to do, or who I'm supposed to be. 

I use they/them or she/her pronouns but no one respects them anyway and I don't want to break up with my girlfriend or fight with anyone anymore over respecting what makes me comfortable in a gender sense anymore.

9,2018-01-03 05:29:10,7nsk6r,3,1,"Hey everyone. I'm on winter break from uni, so naturally, I'm having a mental breakdown. 

I'm AFAB and have been on T for just over 9 months, and I've loved it so far. My mental health is better than it's ever been. I ""pass"" probably 90% of the time as male.

The problem is that my experience of gender fluctuates (it always has, this isn't a surprise). The fluctuation is typically in sync with my weight. So, when I'm losing weight I feel more feminine, and when I'm overweight I feel more masculine (maybe a coping mechanism for weight/body image issues? Also playing into societal standards of beauty).

Now that it's winter break and I have time to breathe again, I've gotten much healthier with my eating and have started to lose weight.

MAab here, but I've been seriously questioning my gender since my early teens at the latest. I'm 24 now, and wondering what I can do to achieve a more androgynous/feminine body without attracting too much attention. I've been shaving my legs/arms/underarms etc for a while already, so any comments about that are already out in the open in terms of family.

I'm around 12 stone/168 pounds. Pretty average for my age, I think. Problem is, I definitely have a bit of a belly forming. It doesn't drop or anything, but it sticks out. 32 waist jeans are tight and restrictive, and I know that hasn't always been the case. I really like the idea of a flat stomach, so simply upping my clothing size isn't going to fix my problem.

So I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on how to get into shape. Searching for fitness articles results in too many conflicting ideas. I just want to flatten my stomach and maybe lose a little weight from my upper legs. People say my calfs are quite bulky-looking already, which I think just comes from how I walk. They're just solid/firm when walking, really. Not bulging with muscle.

I've started with sit-ups/crunches and a daily step counter for now, and I'm trying to watch what I eat by swapping out snacks with a few almonds and semi-skimmed milk with soya/almond milk instead. In terms of drinks, water, tea, coffee and chamomile (with or with spearmint) is basically all I've drank for years now, and the new milk choices are going in coffee and scrambled egg mixtures for the most part. 

That's the best I could understand from all the articles. I don't want to gain muscle at all, really. Especially not in ways that would appear masculine (shoulders etc), so any tips on simply slimming down would be great!

Then I do want to ask about mild HRT stuff. There's 0 chance I'll be going to a doctor about all this stuff, but I've heard some people being happy with self-medicating on low doses of things. I want to avoid breast development if possible, but the weight distribution and skin aspects sound desirable. 

Any advice/experience here would be really appreciated!

AFAB and recently coming out as NB to family &amp; friends at last! Feels great to get they/them'd or sie/hir'd. 

I'm a gym rat into powerlifting-style training who's been lifting for about 4 years, though I was also a running addict previously, and had to sit out heavy lifting for a lot of 2016 because of a disc injury. 

Wonder if anyone has some good tips for helping me developing a manlier shape? I'm not too dissatisfied with my current one: I'm fairly small-framed and never had much bust, and I don't mind having a defined butt from all the squats and deadlifts. But I'd like broader/meatier shoulders and a really solid midsection (along the lines of those often seen on female-bodied Crossfitters) that minimizes my waist.

r/trans_venting is a sub for queer folk to come and pour their hearts out about whatever's giving them a hard time mentally. Don't bottle it in! It's always better to get it out there, even if it's just to strangers on the Internet. Got misgendered at work? Crush that keyboard! Someone called you a slur on your way to lunch? Vent away! Family isn't supportive? Let off some steam! Tell us your life story if you need to (just pay attention to rule 4...)!

The reason I decided to create this sub is because I myself have a tendency to rant on and on about my person life when I post to trans subs, and in hindsight, they probably don't belong on subs meant for Q&amp;A, light banter, and positivity. While it may not fit the bill for every trans-related sub, venting is something that a lot of people need, especially those who don't have anyone close and trans-friendly to talk about these things with.

So come on down, admission's free!

And to the mods, please do not consider this a spam post; although this is posted a few different trans-related subs, this will only be posted once per subreddit. I'm just trying to introduce a new sub that I think has a place in the reddit trans community.

76,2018-01-17 12:51:02,7r0qwv,11,11,"Brief more back story:

My cis male ex (who I left for a gender queer person) said to me in a private message ""it does not feel as bad to be left for *my partners name* as it would feel to be left for someone else"" (implying someone who is not non-binary? or someone with a dick? whatever it's implying it's not nice). I got really upset with him for this comment because it's hurtful and for also misgendering any non-binary person I've heard him talk about, after being asked several times not to. I tried to confront him about how this makes his art project hypocritical and how it is generally problematic because it's appropriating a community he isn't a part of, one he doesn't fully understand and  one I have witnessed him disrespecting. Not to mention all the other reasons it could be seen as problematic. He deflected all of my arguments with ""I respect your opinion but you are misunderstanding me"" and would not have a discussion with me  to clarify how I was misunderstanding the situation. So I commented on one of his FB posts publicly and civilly about why I think it's an insensitive art project but did not out what he had said, then his friends ganged up on me, when I did finally try to end the discussion with quoting what he said to me in private, the comment was deleted and I was blocked. Which feels like proof to me what he said and what he is is doing is wrong.

But am I crazy? Am I being over sensitive? Obviously there is a lot more to the story which I am willing to share and explain. I also have screen shots of the way I was responded to by his friends, and people in the queer Portland community publicly.

I really just want to process this and have a discussion because I'm upset and hurt. It's been really painful to see how invalidating this whole experience has been for my partner and I feel so bad for bringing this into their lives.

I got really upset with him for this comment because it\'s hurtful and for also misgendering any non-binary person I\'ve heard him talk about, after being asked several times not to. I tried to confront him about how this makes his art project hypocritical and how it is generally problematic because it\'s appropriating a community he isn\'t a part of, one he doesn\'t fully understand and  one I have witnessed him disrespecting. Not to mention all the other reasons it could be seen as problematic. He deflected all of my arguments with ""I respect your opinion but you are misunderstanding me"" and would not have a discussion with me  to clarify how I was misunderstanding the situation. So I commented on one of his FB posts publicly and civilly about why I think it\'s an insensitive art project but did not out what he had said, then his friends ganged up on me, when I did finally try to end the discussion with quoting what he said to me in private, the comment was deleted and I was blocked. Which feels like proof to me what he said and what he is is doing is wrong.\n\nBut am I crazy? Am I being over sensitive? Obviously there is a lot more to the story which I am willing to share and explain. I also have screen shots of the way I was responded to by his friends, and people in the queer Portland community publicly.\n\nI really just want to process this and have a discussion because I\'m upset and hurt. It\'s been really painful to see how invalidating this whole experience has been for my partner and I feel so bad for bringing this into their lives.

What I did is i searched out a local OBGYN that is trans friendly, explained that I'm NB and therefore not sure if i should pursue a hysto from a cis angle or a trans angle. With that info, she had me get some screenings (so cis angle) and, while there isn't anything super crazy bad going on, there's enough that my insurance gave the go ahead.

I'm so happy. I can't wait. I'm telling ppl at my work and they keep saying ""im sorry"" and I am so fast to say ""I'm not!"".

108,2018-01-24 04:46:01,7skrm2,22,3,"This sub probably gets posts like this all the time so I apologize for the repetition.

I'm 23 years old and have been identifying as male for my whole life. However, some things have lately been making me wonder if I might be more comfortable calling myself genderqueer/non-binary. I'll just list them below

- Sometimes I really wish I was a woman. Sometimes, I really wish I was something between a man and a woman. Sometimes, I'm OK with being an effeminate man.

- Being referred to as a man sometimes feels wrong to me, but I'm not sure why. The times I've been called a lady, or ma'am felt weird too, but that might just be because I was not used to it.

- I seem to be indifferent to pronouns. Probably 98% of the time I get 'he', but the few times I got 'she' it didn't feel any better or worse. No one has referred to me as 'they'.

- I sometimes fantasize about being a woman or something that isn't male or female. The fantasies are often just somewhat mundane social interactions, but are sometimes sexual. I definitely would not consider it to be just a fetish.

- Certain features of my body that are associated with masculinity often make me feel really self-conscious. I hate how hairy my arms, legs and chest are. I don't like my Adam's apple. I hate how angular and bony my body is in general. Sometimes, I hate my facial hair. Other times, I'm completely OK with some facial hair and actually let a few days of stubble grow out. Is this a mild form of gender dysphoria? I'm not exactly sure I understand what dysphoria is.

- Being in male-dominated spaces makes me feel out of place, as does being talked to as if I were ""one of the guys"". This part is very hard to describe.

- I already break a lot of (most?) male gender expectations/stereotypes.

- I have already adopted a slightly androgynous appearance even though it was not my aim. Enough to rarely get called ma'am or a lady or get she/her pronouns (at least until I speak).

- My girlfriend once put makeup on me, fixed my hair into a more feminine style, and gave me one of her dresses to wear. It was just for fun, but I think I liked how I looked.

Does it sound like I'm genderqueer/non-binary? Part of me keeps repeating that I'm just an effeminate man, but that starts to sound silly if I re-read some of the stuff I just wrote. Part of me wonders if I might be a trans woman that hasn't fully accepted herself, but I don't always want to be a woman. Sometimes I think this is all just me trying to avoid being seen as a man, because I have a somewhat negative view of men in general. Part of me wishes gender didn't exist and no one had to be anything.

If I do want to start identifying as genderqueer/non-binary, how do I even begin? I feel like it would be weird to just pick a day and say that I'm no longer male, but maybe in a way that already happened years ago.

If you've read my ramblings up to this point, thank you! I suppose in the end it's up to me to decide, but advice would be greatly appreciated! I've been losing sleep and falling behind on classes over this.

It kinda feels like everything's going by really fast, it's been about 4 months since all this started. Looking back, it's near obvious that I've always been asexual.

21,2018-01-19 13:45:17,7ridxu,0,7,"Hi everyone, my name is Hannah and I am a film student who has written a script featuring a genderfluid lead role.

Firstly, I am bisexual (only recently sort of came out) so my understanding around everything LGBTQ+ is not the best as it could be. With that said, I was wondering if anyone at all could possibly take a look at my script and give me some feedback/advice - to make sure I have correctly portrayed someone who is genderfluid.

Or, even comment below on how you'd like a genderfluid character to be portrayed. Maybe even some personal information about how you live your life as genderfluid (if you are willing). Any help is welcome!

This script will become a short film where it will be screened (hopefully) in front of a crowd of people at my end of year show. I want this to be as good as I can make it while educating those in the audience who have no idea about LGBTQ+ or genderfluid community.

*Warning* If you happen to read the script, please be warned there is mention of violence/abuse and rape.

Thank you for any help - I will even probably credit help in my dissertation or film :)

P.s The script isn't finished and there is likely a lot of stuff to be changed and added, but I want to get it up on here ASAP to get any feedback before I make edits.

P.p.s The beginning of the script refers to the main character as 'she' because they begin as 'female' then I change to 'they' and 'their' when they have come out as genderfluid.

And the dialogue is shit.
