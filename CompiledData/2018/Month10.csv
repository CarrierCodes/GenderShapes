My friend told me last night about an app he learned about at a game developing convention last year. It's called A Normal Lost Phone. He raved about how after he and his friends finished play-testing it, they were awestruck at how heavy it hit and it was all they could talk about the rest of the day.

The basic concept is the app creates an interface of a fictional person's cellphone that you have found. To play, you have to go through the phone to figure out how to get it back to the owner.

I just finished playing through it on a flight (took me about 2 hours) and it was SO amazing it made me cry. 

I'm hoping we can spread more word of this game, because it could really make such an amazing difference as a tool for education in people's lives.

It's $3, but I swear it is well worth it. If you play it, make sure you pour over every detail.

‚Äã

Hello!

For my university degree project at SAE Institute Glasgow I am creating an album expressing: people's experience being Queer; Queer theory; and my Queer experience.

Everyone's experience is extremely unique yet I want to see what themes arise across a variety of people outside of the cis/hetero-normative idenities.

I have created a survey (linked below) and it would be extremely helpful if you could spare some time to answer what you can! All questions are optional and you can answer as much as your comfortable with, however the more detail of thoughts and feelings the better!

‚Äã

I have a great response from the asexual community so far and I feel it's equally important to get the perspectives of those outside the gender binary as both are often misunderstood and overlooked. Additionally, as I'm having some gender trouble myself hearing your experiences would be personally beneficial haha!

‚Äã

If you have any questions let me know below!

Also, my university email is [94282uk@saeinstitute.edu](mailto:94282uk@saeinstitute.edu) if anyone has further enquiries.

Thank you!

Robert

I start work on Monday. I want to introduce myself as a nonbinary person and tell people that I use 'they' pronouns to refer to myself, and would like it if they did so as well. I want to do this right off the bat, so I won't have to ask people to change pronouns weeks or months into my job - that would be more confusing and difficult for everyone. I work at a growing company (500+ people), so there's also no way I will meet every person I will interact with on day one, so I may have to be introducing myself this way for a while.

This will be a first for me, I've always used the pronouns that I was ""born with"". I have been trying out dressing androgynous and genderfluid, and disregarding gender expectations with my actions and mannerisms, and both make me feel more like myself and make it easier to love myself! I have told my friends I am nonbinary, and my partner (who is super awesome and supportive!) but this will be my first time asking anyone other than my partner to use nonbinary pronouns to talk about me.

I'm Robyn, I'm 28, thought for the longest time I was just a cis-guy with no emotions, realized that's not right, then realized I was actually maybe kind of a transgender girl. So, since the beginning of the year I've been moving forward with that transition, coming out to friends and family, moving forward with getting HRT...

...and yet there was always this nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I wasn't doing things right. I figured it was just my dysphoric brain screwing with me, and that things would be better after I started HRT. And, I was half right, actually. Going on HRT cleared my mind and made me feel like *me* for the first time since when I was a little kid.

But that weird nagging feeling remained. It was like there was this barrier between me and transgender women. Like, a lot of their experiences about discovering their femininity didn't resonate with me. I like presenting as androgynous, there are some stereotypically male things I like, and I never really felt comfortable considering myself as a ""woman"". 

I thought that it might be I'm just butch, or that I've got some form of internalized transphobia to overcome, but neither of those felt right. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I just want to be a cute, slightly androgynous soft-butch tomboy and not have to act womanly or be male.

I talked a bit with some NB people I knew, and I felt that sense of connection that I was failing to get with binary trans women (or with cis-men) and I kind of realized that...hey, maybe this works for me as well?

So I guess I'm some sort of mess of a transfemme non-binary demigirl wibbly wobbly...thingy. Though, I don't really care about the label so much as the fact that I realized I can be feminine without being female, and it's liberating. It's the same euphoria that I had when I realized I wasn't male.

If you got through all that text, then thanks. I've been working my way sorting through the way I feel about myself, and this place seemed like a good spot to drop by.

119,2018-10-08 00:31:34,9ma8g4,2,1,"Hey all!       

I've been thinking about going on E for some time, but I have reservations, and I think talking it out and listening to the experience of other people would help me.         

Some things about me:
I'm 20, AMAB, use she/her or they/them, and am autistic and hella queer.       

Positive thoughts about HRT:
I'm pretty sure I'd love having boobs, as well as basically all of the other physical changes that hormones being about.

I am additionally very uncomfortable as being read as cis male.



Negative thoughts:

I'm somewhat scared of having things that happen while on e to make me dysphoric in the other direction. I, for instance, could imagine overly large beast development making me feel bad as well.           


I don't want to go sterile. I'm not sure that I want kids in the future, but I might. I am also autistic, and have this somewhat nonsensical fear/anxiety that I would be unable to communicate with/relate to children that I may raise (especially if they are not biologically related to me and are not as likely to communicate as I do). 
             
I like being able to get erections, and to penetrate, and would not want that to stop.     
      
I'm just starting to understand how to live with some somewhat serious mental illness, and I'm worried that going through puberty again could be damaging to my mental health.

I'm currently not out to my parents, and although I think everything would be fine, they make me uncomfortable, and used to be emotionally abusive, and I'd rather just not deal with them.          

Additionally, it's scary to think of no longer being able to pass as cis. Being trans around people is scary, and sometimes more than I can deal with (hell, being around people is sometimes more than I can deal with).
       


I think my big problem is that there are not very many research/statistics, and it is incredibly hard to make an informed decision/calculated risk when information doesn't exist.

New to Reddit but thought I share this.

I recently had a bit of a dysphoria filled day. Although I'm glad I was born female cause it makes wearing whatever I more acceptable to society (totally shouldn't make a difference!!) I do hate the fact I'm technically able to grow a mini human inside me, and I get very annoyed at my boobs.

Sometimes I wonder if it would be easier to be FTM as that is something more people understand. Saying I don't want to be a woman but also not a man seems to confuse the hell out of people.

When I voiced this to my partner she just gave me a hug and reminded me that society might try to convince me I don't matter and I'm somehow broken but THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE WRONG, that I do matter, only I can know how I feel and she loves me for who I am, not who the world thinks I should be.

However, in terms of gender, I don‚Äôt know what the hell I am. My therapist, who I‚Äôve been seeing for about 6 months now, is going t set up an appointment with another therapist he knows who specialises in helping people with gender identity issues.

However, I don‚Äôt identify with any gender, but none of the labels or categories feel right to me either. Non-binary isn‚Äôt right, nor is agender, grey-gender, demi-girl, nothing. None of it is right for me.

\*Yes, I will see a doctor as soon as possible. I am not looking for medical advice, only possible similar experiences of other people.  
I'm almost 10 weeks post-surgery and something is definitely not right. For background, I'm AFAB bi-gender, both male and female, and most of the time prefer to have a male body with a female presentation. When I had my surgery even my female side didn't miss my breasts, which were a deflated, floppy DD after massive weight loss. My girl side did want to wear bras though, to make me feel femme when I needed it.  
I'm beginning to suspect I have two things going on -- a previously diagnosed condition called macromastia (diagnosed when I was in my 20s and went from a DDD to an II in only a few months) and possible androgen insensitivity syndrome.   
At about 5-6 weeks post-surgery the swelling went down, and my chest was quite flat, a nice masculine shape. Then in the next week or so I noticed a change in the shape, evenly on both sides, I figured it was just my body working things out, but it kept changing, fast! The upper area, where I am pretty sure the doctor left some breast tissue for shaping, began to grow and become more cone-like. The new cone shape is also starting to expand below the incision lines/bottom of pects, toward my old inframammary line. They seem to be well on their way to filling the soft B cup bras I purchased after surgery, with intent to fill them using breast forms.   
In the last week I gained enough mass that now I can create a decent cleavage. I couldn't do that before, not even close. Now my chest skin is starting to feel uncomfortably stretched, the skin is definitely being expanded by this growth.  
Regarding the suspected testosterone insensitivity, I started T in June 2016, and immediately had a lot of good changes, including bottom growth, and increased hair growth and muscle tone, but my speaking voice never changed (though it wrecked my singing voice, which wasn't all that good anyway) and I never had acne (not complaining!) nor facial changes.   
For two months in late 2016 I quit T because my female side decided to take over, and it just felt wrong, I panicked. I started again because I was suffering without it. But when I restarted, the changes didn't return. Bottom growth did not continue, and even the hair growth didn't return, except for what remained from the first round of T. I had to quit T for a while for top-surgery, and I've been back on it for more than a month now, and I'm not feeling any of the relief effects of T that I initially had.

265,2018-10-17 22:57:56,9p3k4y,0,1,"Today marks the first time I felt comfortable identifying myself as non-binary and it feels really fucking good. I've (AMAB 25) been unsure about my sexuality and gender identity since grade school  (played with my sister's toys as a kid because they had cool mechanics and was always frustrated that certain things that I thought were cool were pigeonholed as ""girly""). I only really came to terms with my pansexuality a few years ago while dating a trans girl who, for the first few dates until she came out to me, passed very convincingly. It was then that I realized I didn't give two shits what someone identifies as or what parts they've got, as long as they're a good person.

When I started dating my current GF, I was relieved to find out she was pan as well so no friction there! She began to express an interest in me crossdessing for her in bed sometimes, and I not-so-reluctantly agreed. I started to realize that - hey - I actually just plain enjoy *feeling* more femme once in a while, beyond just the sexual gratification for her and I. I had talked to her about these feelings almost a year ago and she was very accepting of it, but I had stressed that I was still confused about it. Fast forward to a couple months ago: I made a conscious decision to begin growing my hair out with the goal being shoulder length or just past, I began stealing my girlfriend's more andro clothing pieces like cardigans, sweatpants and jackets, but doing all of this without really acknowledging why it made me feel so cozy on the inside.

A few weeks ago, I stumbled blindly into r/traaa from an askreddit thread and was curious about whether I was an ""egg"" or not. Found my way to egg_irl and while there would be a point here or there I would agree with for me, I didn't really feel ""called out"" by it like some do. Since then I did some serious thinking about my body and what these feelings mean to me and have come to the conclusion that I don't hate, nor do I love all my body's features. I realized that I've been frustrated with my giant Adam's apple for well over a decade, that I wish my hips were wider and my butt was bigger, that maybe having small breasts could be nice. BUT I also realized that i really appreciate my ability to grow an ok beard (babyfaced af until 22), I love my voice (deep and resonating, but still having big falsetto range for singing), and I realized that I cherish and love my penis to no end. Real sure of that one because if I take a break from my ADHD meds and go back on them I can't get a boner for like 2 or 3 days and it's SO FRUSTRATING.

So for a while I was confused because I genuinely feel a certain new happiness that I haven't felt before when I feel femme, but there is no dysphoria about feeling masc. So today I decided to say ""Fuck all this confusion, I'm gonna accept my feelings for how they are and express myself more fluidly"" And layed down with my girlfriend to tell her. She had some questions but it was all in the pursuit of greater understanding and she didn't even hesitate with accepting it (she's a social work student so she's brimming with compassion) and when we were done I cried a little and thanked her. I realized how good it felt to finally be able to say these things with confidence so I wanted to come share good feels with y'all.

I realized how good it felt to finally be able to say these things with confidence so I wanted to come share good feels with y\'all.\n\n**TL;DR I did an NB bingo card today and was a hard yes on 21/25 and it feels great to be comfortable with a label for once.**', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Finally feeling comfortable with a label', 'created': 1539846588.0}"

More detailed story/rant below.  I'm mainly looking for ""what questions should I be asking myself?"" sort of advice since I know no one can just give me an answer.

Long Rambling Story:
I've never really liked dresses/skirts and always prefered jeans/t-shirts/polos and other gender neutral clothing, but always considered that more of a presentation/look thing than anything to do with my identity.  For my hair I grew it out so I'd look less like a guy but hated it down so I kept it up in a ponytail except to shower/sleep.

A couple months ago I decided to try a bob cut because as I said I hated it long but I ended up feeling hugely dysphoric (like last male haircut I ever had dysphoric) but it was because it was way too feminine... not too masculine... and now I don't know what to think.  This is the first time I've ever felt flat out dysphoric because of looking too much like a girl... or maybe hating my long hair was the same and I just didn't realize it for what it was?

Now I'm re-evaluating everything, everything I've done for transitioning has been ""okay it doesn't make me look like a guy, good enough"".  Voice, got it to the point where I stopped being called sir on the phone, good enough.  Keep working till I get ma'am-ed on the phone? Too much work.  Face?  I have pretty androgynous features, I can get gendered female without makeup/FFS, so I wont bother.  Breasts? I've got them, they're small but surgery seems like a lot of work for something cosmetic.  I thought I was just lazy/not as dedicated to passing as some but between that and the dysphoria now I'm wondering if I never felt like trying because I didn't want it.

All that has me wondering if I'm nonbinary.  But at the same time I had huge genital dysphoria and got bottom surgery and I've never had second thoughts about that.  I'm getting to the point where other than a couple of masculine features I'm working on I can look at myself naked in the mirror and see a woman... and that doesn't bother me, but at the same time hormones haven't erased my semi-masculine skeletal structure... so...

291,2018-10-19 05:53:10,9ph178,1,1,"TL;DR  I know I want to be as flat as possible with my shirt on, but no idea what I want to look like with my shirt off. 

So recently I talked to a surgeon about top. I'm pretty set on not wanting D.I. I don't want my nipples to be free grafted.

 I thought that meant my only option was t anchor, like a traditional reduction, but when I went to my consult my surgeon threw me off with mentioning buttonhole. I heard of it, but since this was an insurance provided surgeon I didn't think she'd be willing to do it. I knew she did D.I, Peri, and keyhole, along with breast reductions for cis women. I knew I wouldn't qualify for peri or keyhole, and intended to ask how flat I could get with t-anchor.

 She said, why bother with the extra scar, and said buttonhole seems right for me. I didn't know anything about buttonhole so I feel like I didn't ask any questions I wanted. She said that unless I get D.I. Any surgery I get won't leave me flat, because 1.) I'm big, ""C+ or D"" she said. I have a really small rib cage so they just look so overwhelming. 2.) ""my tissue is like coconut meat, so dense"" üò≠  3.) because of sagging my ""pedicle"" is really long (I lost around 10 pounds a year or so ago) and that has to go somewhere if I'm not going to get the nips cut off and re attached.

If I do buttonhole, I can get down to a B, but it'll still look like a female chest. This is really disheartening. I wanted to be able to take my shirt off at the beach... 

She said a revision could be done later to lipo out any possible fat making them as small as possible, but couldn't guarantee they'd be much smaller.

Breast feeding, as much as I hate the concept, is kind of important to me. I have a killer immune system bc of my mom, and I want to be able to pass that along. Sensation is also important to me. Right now they're so sensitive they hurt when touched, but I think after surgery it'll be just... Normal possibly.

Whatever she asked (""where do you want the fullness? Like regular female breast? Like gynecomastia? Where do you want your nipples? How wide?"") I couldn't answer. I just didn't know. Because I was expecting the possibility of flatter results.

So my questions are... I guess

Did anyone get a reduction instead of complete flat?

What the fuck does a b cup even look like??  I thought I was close to a b cup but apparently not, and the Internet is very... Generous I think (hope?) with what they call a b cup, and most of the images I find are from porn anyway so I can't consider it realistic. 

Should I compromise with what I want? She said I could always just get DI later if I couldn't stand having something even if they're small, but would another surgery leave me more messed up? Would I have less feeling if I did it twice? Or would I just have to worry about healing twice and just the inconvenience of it?

""my tissue is like coconut meat, so dense"" üò≠  3.) because of sagging my ""pedicle"" is really long (I lost around 10 pounds a year or so ago) and that has to go somewhere if I\'m not going to get the nips cut off and re attached.\n\nIf I do buttonhole, I can get down to a B, but it\'ll still look like a female chest. This is really disheartening. I wanted to be able to take my shirt off at the beach... \n\nShe said a revision could be done later to lipo out any possible fat making them as small as possible, but couldn\'t guarantee they\'d be much smaller.\n\nBreast feeding, as much as I hate the concept, is kind of important to me. I have a killer immune system bc of my mom, and I want to be able to pass that along. Sensation is also important to me. Right now they\'re so sensitive they hurt when touched, but I think after surgery it\'ll be just... Normal possibly.\n\nWhatever she asked (""where do you want the fullness? Like regular female breast? Like gynecomastia? Where do you want your nipples? How wide?"") I couldn\'t answer. I just didn\'t know. Because I was expecting the possibility of flatter results.\n\nSo my questions are... I guess\n\nDid anyone get a reduction instead of complete flat?\n\nWhat the fuck does a b cup even look like??  I thought I was close to a b cup but apparently not, and the Internet is very... Generous I think (hope?) with what they call a b cup, and most of the images I find are from porn anyway so I can\'t consider it realistic. \n\nShould I compromise with what I want? She said I could always just get DI later if I couldn\'t stand having something even if they\'re small, but would another surgery leave me more messed up? Would I have less feeling if I did it twice? Or would I just have to worry about healing twice and just the inconvenience of it?\n\nIt\'s a lot, sorry! Just don\'t have many people I can talk about this with, because I hate to even mention that I have...

330,2018-10-21 19:09:08,9q66m1,10,1,"So, I'm AMAB, and most people know me as being transgender, instead of non-binary, because it's a bit easier to explain.    


The way I think people perceive gender, I think, is by accessing ""files"" in their brain.  Due, largely to culture, I think just about everybody has a folder in their brain called ""gender,"" and 2 sub-folders for male and female, which each contain all the cultural assumptions associated with those genders such as: ""What is typical behavior for this gender?"" (someone can behave gender atypically, but it gets noticed (a man wearing makeup is a man wearing makeup, but a woman wearing makeup is just a woman)).  People basically make a series of assumptions about someone based on their gender, until proven otherwise.    


One of these assumptions in particular, is that most people (even though many won't admit it) see and treat men as being more of a potential threat than women (until shown otherwise).  Single fathers are often assumed to be pedophiles or rapists based on nothing but being alone with a child, while this doesn't cross anyone's mind when you see a woman alone with a child.  If a woman compliments another woman, it's seen as being genuinely nice, but if a man compliments anyone the first assumption is that he's trying to fuck.  


So, when people don't fall easily into one of those 2 categories, I think people sort of mentally create a new gender for that person, but also people try to do this with the minimum amount of mental work possible, so generally people are sorted as either a modified version of male or a modified version of female.  I think on the deepest level, most people perceive people AMAB nonbinary/transgender people as a modified version of male, and AFAB nonbinary/transgender people as a modified version of female.  


The modifications I think people make are mostly surface level.  The aspects of gender that are more often consciously thought about are modified to be in line with the gender wants to be perceived as (at best, although often not even that much).  I think the way people perceive me, who think of me as a transwoman, essentially attach me to the ""male"" folder in their brain, but it's a modified version, where they are trying to perceive me as a woman, so they rebuild the whole concept of womanhood, as much as they can into a modified version the ""male"" folder.  So, basically, in every way they can consciously think about it, I'm seen as a woman, but in all the subconscious ways that people don't talk about or want to openly admit, I'm seen as a man.  


So, the sort of way that men are seen as a bit more of a threat, I have that notion attached to me.  This makes seeking female friends a lot more difficult.  I think generally cishet people combat this by generally make other cishet friends of the same gender, at least at first.  A heterosexual man can approach another heterosexual man for friendship, without being seen as a threat because there is a balance of power, and then eventually prove to each other, and by extension each other's friend groups to not be a threat, and potentially make female friends by extension.  In the same sort of way, women can approach other women, because they don't see each other as threats in the first place.  In essence, it's a bit easier to make friends of one's own gender.  


The thing is, I don't really have that.  I have to prove to women that I'm not threatening, and because I'm not above any of the psychology here, I kinda need men to prove to me that they aren't threatening, and when it comes to other transgender/nonbinary people I have to deal with some sort of combination of those 2 things.

Currently, and for the last three months, I figured myself as non binary, demigender(woman). However I'm feeling myself change and I'm not sure why.   
AMAB, but do not want anything to do with male/masculine stuff. I'm on hrt to feminize, I try and hide masculine traits, and just be comfortable in my skin.   

However I know I'm not a woman. I don't feel like one, I don't want to be one, I don't want to be labeled as one... But my gender shifts very closely to that of one, so I felt demigender was pretty accurate. I'm very much andro/middle/none, and sometimes femme. It changes. Sometimes in the same day. Sometimes I'll be one for a few days. It hasn't caused too many issues because my style is that of comfy clothes and not really femme stuff like dresses, so I've been able to be comfortable.    

But something is not right and I don't know what. I'm beginning to doubt myself a lot. I'm getting a tiny bit dysphoric about thinking of where my breasts will grow to, yet a few hours later or the next day I'm happy and excited to see where they go. I'm happy about my body and then I'm hesitant.    

My shifts between femme and neutral are starting to become more noticeable and it feels like they are different things, instead of a bit of the two.

I guess I just don't know where I stand or what. Does *anyone* have experiences similar to this? I'm just so confused on how to feel about how I feel right now.     
I know genderflux is a term, but I don't really understand the percentages explanation so I don't know...

392,2018-10-24 15:57:06,9r0wuw,7,1,"Greetings my fellow gender non confirming friends,

I (AFAB) have been through a lot the past few months and am now seeking advice on my gender identity. I want to preface my post by saying that I grew up in a very conservative household. My parents are Russian and they don't believe in jomosexuality or in transgender people. Once I moved out I started exploring myself and my feelings more thoroughly. I knew I'm pansexual since puberty, but I have also been a tomboy since I was able to express my discomfort with dolls and everything with the colour pink. So since I moved out I have been experimenting with different kind of looks that I never could try out whilst living with my parents. I was not allowed to wear short dresses and didn't even think about binders and suits. But now I know that I feel very comfortable in boy mode. Of course I love to wear a dress once in while - they're comfortable as heck. 

However, I found the terms ""agender"" and ""non-binary"" on the internet and it seemed fitting. My parents would never know I identify as non binary and I don't have to come out, since I have always been kid of boyish and my language doesn't know any neutral pronouns. 

That's the story up until a few months ago. I began to remember episodes from my childhood, where I denied being a girl and where I felt humiliated when I was considered such. I began to realize that there is a reason I hate my breasts and therefore I should seek treatment, which wasn't easy to get in my city. The only help I received was a therapist who didn't even specialise in gender and sexuality, but she tried helping me find my identity nonetheless. She made me realize, that I have no fucking idea who I am. Considering my upbringing I could be a scared ftm who is afraid of social stigmata and hate as well as be a non binary person. I have been lurking in this subreddit as well as over there at r/ftm and I see myself in posts of both subreddits. 

So my question is, whether anybody here could help me find my peace regarding my gender. Is there anybody who felt similar and how did you find an answer? Is there such a thing as ""identifying as both agender and male, but not being gendefluid""? Are there any resources out there that I could read to get a better understanding of these issues? I know that my long term goal is transitioning. What I don't know is how far and what operations I want to get exactly. I'm afraid of T, but I am longing for top surgery. I am well aware that I need therapy, believe me, I'm on several waiting lists. The problem is that I am moving from city to city every few months to years and it is hard to find a therapist who would treat me longer than just a few months. If anybody is able to ease my mind until I get therapy, I would be very, very grateful. 

P.S. You are all lovely and beautiful people and it makes my day to look through the selfies posted here. Keep up the good spirit!

Anyway like the title says, I'm seeking out media (books/comics/tv or whatever really) or real life people (like youtubers, ect.) of a specific kind?  Real life youtubers talking about their experiences would be amazing, but also I never see people like me in fiction either (except maybe female dwarfs in fantasy works), so that would be neat too...

The kind I'm looking for? People that present clashing gendered cues of the kind that show the influence of both testosteron and estrogen (for example, a beard, deep voice, breasts, and hips at the same time) with the person not trying to hide the testosterone/estrogen side. Honestly, my ideal physical state is more important to me than pronouns, so even a binary woman that decided to proudly show off her beard or a binary guy who had gynecomastia and didn't care to hide it would feel more representative than the ""no gendered characteristics displayed"" or the binary-passing kind of nb. Not to dismiss those kinds of nb, or call binary people like that any less binary! It's just that kind of physical presentation is rare but important to me. Of course human, nonbinary-identity rep of this kind would be even more amazing.

Not to undervalue the nb representation that's been coming lately! Or nb youtubers!

Gender fluidity and the concept of being non-binary has fascinated me for a while. Mainly because I have found it difficult to understand, and partly because I want to understand.

I'm always on the side of people following the path that makes them comfortable, with the usual caveat of it not causing harm to others, so I hope I'm not offending anyone with my upcoming thoughts and questions. Having given this issue a lot of thought I'd like to ask the following:

1) Why and how does the spectrum of gender, differ from the spectrum of character/traits/experience of being a male or female?

2) By identifying as non-binary, are you not by default defining what it is to be male or female, and therefore limiting the spectrum of male/female experience?

3) Would/could it be empowering to broaden the perception and expectation of what it means to be biologically male or female, rather than distancing yourself from what you feel society expects of those genders? Would your disassociation from those genders be lessened if a broader spectrum of each of those was more readily visible and accepted in society?

Yet despite my desire to be feminine, I have no issues with presenting myself in a masculine way if it allows me to navigate through the cisgendered world unscathed. (this is most likely a survival trait that I developed during my many years of denial)

I've recently found out about this sub and after reading previous posts, I have a few questions, and if it doesn't go against the sub's rules, I would like you to answer

Firstly, I would like to start by congratulating all of you for this safe environment that you've created

Secondly, I'm a Spanish speaker and i have studied English for a few years. I've learned how to treat people in my first language, but I still need help with my second language, English.

Regarding the questions, if someone doesn't identity as a male/woman. Is it ok to use the adjectives beautiful/handsome with them? 

Also, is it rude to ask what gender someone identifies with? Is there a more polite way to ask it? Please, don't get me wrong here. As a not native speaker of the language, I'm in constant 'fear' of making mistakes by using it. And I don't want to offend someone by mistaking their identity.

Also, in Spanish I can talk to/about a person without saying any pronoun. In English it is more difficult to do it (at least for me). Is it rude if I start using the pronoun 'they' when addressing someone? (Bearing in mind that they could actually be a he or a she)

Finally, do you get offended when people refer to a group of people with 'guys'? I've learned that, for example, I could say 'good morning guys' even if there aren't only males. Would it be ok if I say 'thanks guys' in this sub?

Thanks for you help.

It makes me afraid of women, who I've usually preferred to socialize with than men.

If anything, anything bad that men have done to me has made me *more* hesitant to identify with them over women, not less.

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm a freelance writer working with Teen Vogue and Broadly. 

For Teen Vogue I'm looking to interview non-binary people who are in a current \[or past\] relationship and have dating advice for other within the gender nonconforming community. 

For Broadly I'm looking for non-binary people who may have self-care tips or positive coping mechanisms as it pertains to transphobia, gender dysphoria, and the overall challenges of living as a non-binary person in general. 

For either, contact me [SerenaSonoma1@gmail.com](mailto:SerenaSonoma1@gmail.com) to set up an email or phone interview.

As the title suggests, I‚Äôm confused about my gender identity and I was hoping you could give me some advice. Since I came to college just over a year ago I‚Äôve been able to grow as a person and become more myself. A part of this process has been having a better understanding of my gender. Though I have identified as a man, practically my entire life, I also felt like there was something off about the whole thing in my case. Thanks to a conversation I had with a friend who is also questioning their gender identity, I have been able to articulate this ‚Äòoff-ness‚Äô better. I do feel like I am partially male, but at the same time this feels restrictive and not entirely accurate. There is also a part of me which I would say is either neutral, or without gender at all.

There are a lot of things that I want to try out (like becoming more androgynous in my appearance) but at the same time am really scared to do. Though my university is very progressive and accepting, the same cannot necessarily be said about the town I live in, unfortunately. At the same time, I do feel like a bit of an impostor at moments; as of now I‚Äôm not even sure if I‚Äôm really not just male, or if I am just making things up. There is also a part of me that wonders if I should even bother, given that this will cause me a lot of hassle in terms of incomprehension from the people around me. I also don‚Äôt really have any dysphoria about my body, and I‚Äôm pretty ok with people using male pronouns for me (though I also like the idea of neutral pronouns, and I also wouldn‚Äôt mind if people used female ones). Even so, I feel like I would be happier if peoples‚Äô image of me was more in line with how I feel.

So, what do you think? Do you have any advice about what I could or should do?

I have a really hard time finding pants that don't look ridiculous on me (men's or women's) so I tend to stick to leggings and tee shirts/flannels/sweaters. I'm pretty petite (5'3/125 pounds) but I have wide hips and a large chest which makes clothes shopping hard even within my assigned sex. 

I guess I was wondering if anyone knew of good websites or stores or brands in general to get clothes that look more neutral without being really baggy and ridiculous. 

My second thing is a more general question but. How do you assess whether or not short hair will look bad? I have always had fairly long hair, because I feel like my facial features (long nose especially) would make a shorter cut look bad// which makes me really sad when I think about it. 

I'm pretty closed to most people about my feeling nb, because I feel invalid for presenting so feminine most of the time. So being able to present more andro would definitely (I hope) make me feel more comfortable expressing myself as who I am. I have a supportive significant other and a few friends that know but more than anything I just want to feel comfortable in my own skin and I never really have.

And I have ***never*** had a problem with my penis. Not ever.

My partner is a cis-gender woman and we often have PIV sex. We've always had great sex, before and after I realised I was trans. But then, just yesterday, I just wanted to take my genitals off and put them away somewhere. I was lying almost naked on bed and the room was a bit warm. All I could think of was to take this extra source of heat from between my legs and put it as far away from my body as possible.

I chalked it off to the heat and tried not to think of it... Until today, when I sat down to work in my underwear and... these *things* were just... down *there*, you know. In the way. 

I know that‚Äîat least right now‚ÄîI'd feel more comfortable if they weren't there. I don't want to get rid of them, I know that. But I'd feel better if I didn't have them attached to my body right now. 

I mean, I've heard many a cis girl say *""gosh, boobs can be really uncomfortable! I wish I could just take them off for a while.""*  This might be just like that, right?

If it helps, when I was just a girl, I'd hide my thing between my legs and pretend I had a pussy, but it was like a fun game. I liked looking at my ""pussy"". Then I'd untuck and kept being a child. I wouldn't give it a second thought.

One day, when I was like 6 or 7, I took my round paper scissors and put them round the base of my thing. I squeezed a little, but stopped almost immediately. I knew I'd cut myself and bleed if I pressed hard. I really didn't want to have a painful cut there nor to get in trouble with my mother. I never said anything to anybody until today. 

I do remember that I didn't do it over any sadness or discomfort with my penis. I don't remember thinking that part of my body had anything to do with it either. I swear I still have no idea why I did it.

I totally know that dysphoria doesn't need to be experienced from an early age to be authentic. By extension, I know this also applies to genital dysphoria. I just don't know if that's what's going on here.

I mean, I used to be so sure I didn't want SRS and now this happened and I don't know anymore and I hate not knowing things and I want to cry a little because I'm scared.

I'm sorry for the long post in advance.

So...Ever since maybe high school? Maybe before that? I began to question my gender. I kind of knew that that was normal and thought nothing of it...until it continued all the way 2 years after high school. In high school, I questioned it OFTEN. Often times to the point where'd I'd accidentally get myself into a panic attack. Constantly questioning to where my head hurts and I just feel numb all over.

I would then get my hair short and loved it. Dresses? Felt uncomfortable. Makeup? Eh. Just girly stuff in general? Always felt wrong to me. But, I thought, Hey I'm just a tomboy maybe I can get used to the girly stuff.

News flash: I still have not. I feel like it isn't even me when I look in the mirror with girly stuff. I feel super happy with the short hair and having guy moments. Dressed as a guy for my cousin's graduation and man did I feel good. Button up with slacks and shoes? Oh yes. 

Now I'm not terribly uncomfortable with a vagina. I'm just...neutral, I guess? Same for breasts but then I get days where I'm law, is this even supposed to be here? It feels alienated. My name even sounds weird. 

I've gone back and forth. I also have BPD which is the main reason why I question, due to fearing that it could be the BPD acting up or imposter disorder (I think that's the thing?)

35,2018-10-03 12:12:11,9l0kr0,13,1,"Hello there, I am sure you are tired of people questioning things about your gender and having the need to explain themselves. That would tire anyone. However I am very uneducated in this area and would like to know trans people perspectives in order to better understand and coexist.

Some background: I am cis male from a small country that is quite intolerant sadly. I don't personally know any trans people, its never talked about in the media and for like 15 years of my life I didnt even fully understand its a thing (similar experience with LGBT people but I got to know some of them personally). I have never had any thoughts of changing my gender, and the only times I've crossdressed was in theater sketches, mostly for comedic effect. The only reason I am so interested in this topic is because I recently came across a youtube channel ContraPoints, which has interesting topics in general, but also touches upon transgender issues.

My questions:
1. Do you think there are two genders, and you transition from a to b or vice versa, or there is this spectrum with you falling somewhere in the middle? 
2. Are there more men who transition into women, or more women who transition into men?
3. How did being trans affect your sexual orientation? If you were a straight men and become a woman, are you still into women or does that change? Or are all trans people initially gay  but become straight afterwards?
4. Are you always thinking about gender identity, sex, etc. I noticed that LGBT people I know all seem to be very tied to their orientation as part of their core identity?
5. Is it important to you that others perceive you as your new gender in terms of appearance? If you transition into a women, do you try to be very feminine? Doesnt that just enforce gender stereotypes? I know there are trans people who take pride in having female body with facial hair, what is the term and reasoning for that?
6. Are there any trans people who arent so focused on gender at all. For example, some cis people really take pride in the fact they are male or female. Others, like me, don't really consider their gender to be very important to their sense of self. Is it possible to live as a human that is comfortable in their own skin, WITHOUT bringing up identity politics?
7. How do you feel about legislating gender pronouns. I understand that if someone used the wrong pronoun on you, you might feel like your choice of gender expression isnt valid, but should misgendering be considered a crime? Personally I use the pronoun I think when I see the person, so if you look like a female to me, I will say she/her. But if you said to me calmly that youd rather be called he/him, I will do so going forward.
8. Obviously this is one of those topics where being objective is very hard because it affects you personally. One thing of criticisim I hear is that people who believe there are two genders and no switching should be allowed are using scientific facts while transfolk use feelings and 'inner truth' as their defense. Is this assumption true? Are there any famous trans people who debate without bringing up their own feelings?

50,2018-10-04 05:49:25,9l97jb,11,1,"I noticed my feminine traits at a young age. I remember lounging on the couch and thinking I should change my position because only girls sit like that (I don't remember any specifics beyond that). I was around 8 years old. By 10, I was overwhelmed by and ashamed of my interest in feminine things. In my mind, indulging in those interests would make me a fag which was something I was taught to fear even though my mother was ok with lesbians. One specific comment she made around then stands out in my recollection, ""See those two right there? Stay away from them, they'll turn you into a faggot."" A guy and his crossdressing partner (probably trans, but it was the 90's in rural Iowa).

I was 11-12 the first time I wished I could be a girl, ""Starlight, Star bright..."" Yeah. It was within a year after that that I started sneaking my sister's clothes to wear when I was home alone so I could see what it felt like to be a girl. At 15, I started using sexuality to feel feminine (thanks to all the pedos of Yahoo! Chat! Lol). That continued for the next 11 years. 

During that time, my sexual behavior could be called self-harm. When I finally started being with girls irl, I couldn't orgasm. So naturally, I thought I was gay and started trying guys. I didn't enjoy the sex as much as with women except for 1 thing: men loved feminizing me and it was better than in the chatrooms. I was a huge slut, and I'm damn lucky I never caught anything worse than a yeast infection.

After I finally learned to have my own orgasm at 26 (no joke) but actually found my interest in sex decreasing, I despaired for a little bit. What was wrong with me that I didn't enjoy the best feeling I'd ever had? I couldn't help but wonder. I began having sex less and less because it started making me miserable. FINALLY, I came to a realization after a somewhat dark sexual encounter: I hate penetrating. More than that, I hate my penis and the urge to penetrate with it. I hate my testicles and their need to ejaculate. I cried and wished I could be free of all that. 

So came an increase in how often I wished to be a woman, and I was even crazy enough to work out how exactly to word a wish to a genie to make it happen how I want it to happen if I ever met one. Then, I started looking at sissy porn. A sort of revisit to my feminization via sexuality. I found myself wishing I could even be one of the sissies in the porn, they might not have a woman's body but they at least had a hope of passing unlike me. If they wanted to transition, they could at least look like a woman. That's when it hit me: I want to transition, but I'm afraid to look like a she-he freak (no offense intended, just explaining the process). Who would ever possibly want to date a woman who was obviously trans? But wait... I've been single for 10 years. Who am I holding out for? Why not just do something to reduce my misery in being alive even a little? So what if I won't ever be a supermodel, it's not like I'm magazine worthy now. And so finally on my 31st birthday, I admitted to myself that I wanted hrt. The genie exists, I had just been too cowardly to make the wish. So I called Planned Parenthood and made the appointment.

I don't think I would have been so rampantly sexual if I hadn't suppressed so hard. I wouldn't now cringe from being touched by people. I wouldn't have had arguments with women I was trying to date because my lack of orgasm made them insecure. I wouldn't have experienced post-penetration rape.

56,2018-10-04 20:39:40,9lfoug,0,1,"Hi there I‚Äôm having an issue right now and I‚Äôm quite upset and distressed by this and I really need some advice on my situation 

So I started self medicating with hormones in sept 2017 and it was a rough ride from the begging 
I didn‚Äôt have the funds to go private and I didn‚Äôt have my appointment for the nhs ( uk based ) trans clinic for 2 years so I‚Äôve still got one year left to wait for my first appointment 

And I just felt like I couldn‚Äôt wait 
so I found a local charity called cliniq that does all blood levels for trans women and men 

So I got my levels done for the first time in September and my oestrogen was at 70 pmol/L
Whatever I didn‚Äôt really care because it was before 
They refused to test my testosterone I have no idea why and that upsets me still

But anyways 
I had a tough ride because I was on spiro which was working fairly well to begin with felt great and all 4 mg progynova a day since the beginning until now and finaesteride 1 mg too since the beggining
I soon become sick and unwell from the spiro in so many ways I can‚Äôt explain and had to come off of that 

Soon after I tranferrrd over to cyprotone acetate 
And nothing prepared me for how much this was going to effect me really...
Quite quickly within 4 months of treatment I had become withdrawn depressed anxious and tired 
I gained weight which was good for me because I‚Äôm so skinny and changes wise my boobs were progressing with growth lol .. although very slowly ... and my body hair was almost gone all over my body

I was finishing up with laser hair removal and that had been going amazingly on my face too
Maybe one more touch up but barely needed

This leads me to about 2 months ago or so when I was just so down and low I decided to give it a go without them because I was just so depressed
I had lowered the dose and cut the pills up and still no luck
Even taking it every other day 

I never took 50 mg either only 25 mg 

No luck...

Anyways so I went off of them for a while and have just re tested my levels and when I got them today I was so shocked I cried instantly 

This is how it reads 
I need some insight into this
Btw reminder I‚Äôm on 4 mg progynova 
1 mg finaesteride 


Oestradiol : 165 Pmol/L

( free androgen index )

SHBG : 28 nmol/L
Extracted testosterone 15.0 nmol/L
Test SHBG ratio 53.0

I'm Jamie, 26, and today I told a friend that I might be trans. She was super supportive (and an absolute babe). 

I'm looking for some advice on where/what to do next.

What I know already:

* From early teens I remember being envious of girls; the way they got to dress, makeup, boobs, long hair, even the way they walked (It wasn't a 'I wanna' bang her', it was a '*I wanna'* ***be*** *he*r')
* Unsupportive parents (for anything apart from 'normal') meant I didn't talk about anything. Dad forced me into more 'guy stuff'; fighting, drinking, making fires, proving yourself to be a man, etcc. I hated it, but it became the norm after a few years
* I've struggled with my identity over the years; in terms of 'why am I on this planet?!'
* University was my first time properly away from home and I drunk so much alcohol my liver almost failed (a story for another day - I've been sober for over 6 years!), looking back I was trying to escape my returning feelings of envy 
* Over the last 6-9 months the envy towards women has come back stronger than ever before; I've wanted to *be* that woman so many times
* I'm living with a really cool flatmate (he's also a close friend) who is basically never here...
* I've been shopping online for girl clothes, which has been exciting (like, ear to ear smiling at the thought of wearing that cute dress or top!) but also scared
* I *love* how I look in dresses, tops, etc. BUT I hate looking at my shoulders/ face (in fact I re-angle the mirror so I don't have to see it - When I catch a glimpse of my face it usually makes me straight up cry, or I just stare back at the mirror because I don't recognise the person looking back)
* I get home from work; shower, shave, and put on some of my girl clothes and relax in front of the TV, cook, etc. It's basically my routine now as my flatmate is basically never here 
* I literally have two fashion wardrobes (those ones with just the metal pole?). They're at opposite sides of my room. One is for my boy clothes and the other for my girl clothes.
* The worst time of my day is getting out of bed(!) and reaching for the boy clothes

I don't want to let myself 'forget' (read: bury!) these feelings again, I've been unhappy for too many years already... but I don't know what to do next.

Sorry I worked with you all day and legit can't remember your name. I'll get it by the end of this gig...I hope. 

I bet you feel awkward. You were being kinda awkward. The most awkward moment was when you were surprised when I called my ex ""he."" Yes, he. A straight cis gendered he. But I'm not writing this to berate you for being awkward. 

I'm writing this to thank you. 

Thank you for double checking if my name was Andrea* or Andrew* and not batting an eye when I said people call me both. I don't know how you realized I was trans. Maybe it was when I used the ""family"" bathroom during the break. Maybe it's my hair. Or my pants. Whatever it was, you didn't know, but you noticed. 

Thank you for joking all day. A lot of your jokes were offensive, and I didn't like some of them, but you did make the day go a lot faster. 

Thank you for making it so that I outed myself to anyone who could hear me. I'm not really out at work because it would be a lot of explaining to a lot of people I rarely see. But you were trying to backpedal after being awkward about my ex by making a joke about Mrs Doubtfire and pronouns. Because of the banter, I felt comfortable saying that ""I'm a they"" in front of the whole crew.

Most of all, thank you for giving me shit about my pronouns. Why would I thank you for that? Well, because you used them. You didn't tell me I was weird. Or that they/them pronouns didn't make sense. You were picking on everyone all day to make people laugh. So when you said something to the effect of, ""whatever you say, *they*"" it made me laugh. You were giving me hell the same way you had been doing all day, but you were also acknowledging me and the fact that I had told you something important. (Plus, it was impressive that you seemed to process that new information so seamlessly.)

I hope you don't think you offended me. I hope that we get to talk gender again tomorrow, and that I can reassure you that you made me feel better and more comfortable being myself. I know you're not exactly PC and that you don't get all the complexities of being queer or trans or gay. But I also know that you are open, accepting, and curious in a way that means you're willing to learn. 

So thanks dude. See you tomorrow.

I have my first GIC appointment next month but, since leaving school (UK) and moving to university I've been unable to tell anyone I'm transgender. Something about the idea of this person *knowing I have a penis* and possibly *making assumptions about my life and I based on that knowledge* creeps me out and makes it impossible to tell them. After three years I've figured out what works for my face and I pass in day-to-day life, more or less. It's entirely plausible everyone assumes and thinks I'm transgender, but for some reason that doesn't bother me nearly as much as knowing for sure that they know they for sure... if that makes sense. But my voice is very low, and has a grating buzzing sound to it that makes me nauseous, so I never speak, I'm entirely mute in all situations, including when I'm alone. I know that with three years of voice training I could be so much closer to a passing voice today, but I made the mistake of choosing mutism long ago and now whenever I make noise I want to vomit, probably in an attempt to fill my mouth with something other than my voice.

To hide my transgenderism I've lied a lot. Generally I don't feel bad about it. These lies have no victims. Almost all of it is tactful omission. But it also involves not using social media at all, because I don't pass in photos nearly as well as in reality, and my struggle to accept my appearance is one I can't describe without involving my dysphoria in the explanation, so I can never talk about that either. Lately I've found myself getting the urge to just *stop trying to hide it*. Not to come out in some grand gesture, but to just slowly release, to let go of the deceit, and let people find out on their own. It's tempting because it will allow me to use online dating, which I currently can't use since I'd have to state I'm transgender and someone I know might see the profile, and use Facebook/Instagram/etc. the way cisgender girls do all the time like it's second nature.

But it scares the heck out of me, because I can't talk about it with anyone even if I know they know about it. If someone mentioned seeing my dating profile, for example, I'd hate that. It would make me want to die. They'd *know*. They'd know and they might no longer perceive me as the *kinda weird-looking girl* and instead as *the transgender girl*, and that would change their behaviour. I'm scared of that change, and of everyone knowing something so intimate about me, but I also just want to feel free for once. I can feel that freedom post-surgery; once I no longer have a penis, any thoughts others have about my gender will be baseless, since by all accounts, I'm fully a woman; I have a vagina, I have breasts, they can't expect more from me.

I know all women are valid regardless of their genitals. Of course they are. And they, and I, should feel comfortable and valid in their own bodies, knowing that gender isn't related to biological sex in the way we used to think it was. But in reality, and especially in dating and sex, my genitals affect me and how others perceive me. It changes whether someone hits on me, or whether they freak out when I let them know what they're about to see, etcetera. I can't pretend society doesn't affect how I feel about myself. It always will. I guess I was hoping someone could help me figure out whether what I'm afraid of is a baseless fear, or if I should keep hiding this until I'm more confident with my body thanks to the surgeries. They could be two or three years from now and I don't know if I can wait that long to put myself on social media and dating sites.

I can feel that freedom post-surgery; once I no longer have a penis, any thoughts others have about my gender will be baseless, since by all accounts, I'm fully a woman; I have a vagina, I have breasts, they can't expect more from me.\n\nI know all women are valid regardless of their genitals. Of course they are. And they, and I, should feel comfortable and valid in their own bodies, knowing that gender isn't related to biological sex in the way we used to think it was. But in reality, and especially in dating and sex, my genitals affect me and how others perceive me. It changes whether someone hits on me, or whether they freak out when I let them know what they're about to see, etcetera. I can't pretend society doesn't affect how I feel about myself. It always will. I guess I was hoping someone could help me figure out whether what I'm afraid of is a baseless fear, or if I should keep hiding this until I'm more confident with my body thanks to the surgeries. They could be two or three years from now and I don't know if I can wait that long to put myself on social media and dating sites.

153,2018-10-11 21:23:14,9ne39h,0,1,"Hi kind people. I... Am not so sure what I want to say here. I am looking for a place where I can be open and honest, and have some conversations with others. I hope I came to the right spot.

Firstly, I'm a guy. I wouldn't call myself feminine-ly shaped; I'm quite broad, hairy legs and chest, big hands and a shapeless butt. For a long time I've been a heavy metal fan, among many other genres incl classic music and Irish folk music, and have had long hair since im 11.

I never rally felt uncomfortable with myself, except that I used to and still am (although less) on the fattier side of things. But that's more for r/fitness and what not.

Although I've never felt out of body, or out of place, I have been thinking about what it's like to be a girl. It started with simple curiosity when looking through catalogues of clothing shops, and always dwelled longer on the female clothes because they're more interesting (which.. They are, i guess). I was often imagining how life would be if I had been born a girl at that time too.

Life went on and I never paid much attention to it after that. That was until somewhat recently. I talked with my now ex GF about clothes and shoes for women, she suggested I should try a pair of heels just for fun. This might sound like a big jump, but in reality it wasn't so sudden. I told her I liked seeing high heels on her, and shopping for them with her as well (foot fetish included, so that's an easy sum).

When we ordered a pair we both liked, I tried them on and it excited me a lot. Not really to the liking of her, as she's more 'traditional' in that sense, well, more old fashioned. 

Anyway. There's perhaps a time gap of 10 years in between these two episodes. In the mean time I had tried a dress of my step sister at some point, looked at porn (trans/trap included from time to time), and got to know my sexual self better as years passed.

During those years I also saw a change in myself. It started with 4chan. There was a time I was a bit down and 4chan is a distraction, not a great one at that tho, but one none the less. When you're on the random bord, you will encounter trap threads. They interested me, and after the initial denial I experienced, I started to look for those threads after a while. Then not so long ago, I realised that, yes, some are men, some are trans and see themselves as a woman, but they have a penis. And so what? What's the matter with that? There's no right and wrong in this sense. If they see themselves as a woman, then that person is a woman to me. Regardless of what's there is or isn't. 

So right now I'm at a point where I would love to go on my knees both for a nice pussy, or a nice dick. And since I'm single again now, I want to do those things, and expand on my sexuality. I want to buy myself some nice heels (I returned the ones I ordered earlier) and dress up nicely with stockings and a dress.

I'm still interested in life as a woman, but I'm not sure what that means, because I am happy with myself as I am as well.

Like I said. These are thoughts that have been going on for a long time. And it's a bit of therapy to write them down, imaging that others are listening. So. If you want to drop your thoughts in a reply, I'd like that. If you got bored reading halfway and skipped to the end for the tl;dr, I have to disappoint you, its not here.

He hasn't expressed any need to go by she/her pronouns, so use he/him is still okay. He's confused, I'm confused, neither of us knows what's going to happen. He said he doesn't know if he's trans, only very very recently has he started to feel like its more than just the clothes. He said he feels more comfortable in women's clothing, and that the idea of wearing men's clothes stresses him out. I do suspect he's had these feelings for a lot longer but didn't want to express them to me.

I'm terrified that I'm doing everything wrong here, that I'm making it worse. I don't want to make this about me but I'm so scared that I won't be attracted to him. I already miss his beard, his cologne... I'm a straight woman but I've been known to make out with girls when drinking (what woman hasn't I guess), and I'm desperately hoping this means I'll be able to discover I'm actually bisexual or something.

Anyway, does anyone have advice on this situation? We've both agreed he needs to find a therapist to really talk through things, especially since he doesn't know if he's trans or not. I'm also worried this is just a bi-polar thing, when he first started crossing, he was absolutely obsessed with it, as bipolar tends to make you do that, but he said this feels different, as it hasn't gone away like previous obsessions have. He said he feels like an asshole because he's putting me through this but I feel like the asshole for not just being able to say, ""Ok! I find you sexy no matter what!"" It's all made worse by the fact that he has terrible depression, struggles with suicidal thoughts, has no job because his anxiety is so bad, and I'm supporting him 100%.

I watch Better Call Saul and I identify strongly with the character of Jimmy mcGill before he became Saul Goodman. Not because I'm a con artist or dodgy lawyer, but because his character arc of trying to find his place in the world and be accepted I feel matches my struggles. And his trajectory of feeling increasingly overwhelmed and hopeless and bitter is how i feel I'm becoming. What do you do when you feel fucked over every time? Become a bitter bastard? Or submit to being defeated and concentrate on making the generation kick ass?   


When I was 24, and very much an egg despite feeling feminine for many years, and I looked like an average male. Anyway, the medium seemed convinced I'd transition at 35 when I was living abroad, which was quite a surprise to me given that something like that wasn't even on my radar. They said that it'd be very difficult and they were worried for me. I didn't even get what they were saying at first and i didn't really take any of it in as being 35 seemed like a century away. Maybe they cold-read something in my demeanour, maybe they got lucky guessing, no idea. I was very secretive about my quick cross-dressing inklings, and it wasn't something i wanted to share. I'm a sceptical believer regarding the paranormal. i believe in it (due to three specific instances), but i also believe that 99% of the time there is a boring, mundane and very earthly reason to anything potentially paranormal.   


Anyway, I'm 33 now, and despite battling hairloss for six years, I've finally lost the battle. It's gone from being receding to full balding in just over a year. even the thick areas have suddenly gone thin. i had stunted growth as a kid and was fairly androgynous until around two years ago, now that advantage to being feminine has also gone. I've gone past the point as to where my physicality could have assisted a decent transition.  I've just started a new job which is dull but pays well (very much a Davis and Maine situation, for those that watch Better Call Saul). There's a sabbatical option where after two years of work i can leave work for a year, this would be possible in 2020. increasingly i'm planning to save up, leave work for the year, go abroad and transition somewhere away from family and friends (probably armed with a stockpile of HRT).   


My point is that, weirdly, never in my life has it looked like i'd transition very shortly more than now. And it'd be when I would be....35. Maybe it's a self fulfilling prophecy where I've subconsciously made everything aline to match the medium's reading, who knows. But given what they said, and what I know about the world, it does seem like a transition for me would be a real shit show in any case. So, everything up until 35 now feels like some weird prequel, where I already know the end of the story and that's some sort of difficult unhappiness being trans and nearing midlife when dreams usually decay. Not the most inspiring of potential futures to wake up to. I'd just say sod it and have kids and then be a really pushy parent so they fulfil their dreams and potential no matter what the cost to them or myself, but I think that's just as unhealthy as being selfish, not having a kid and saying that I'm not done yet trying to be who i want to be - also regarding the cost.  


Probably TDR or a niche post, and no one watches Better Call Saul, so that reference is probably lost on people, but anyway, there we go.

People are pretty open and kind to most of the LGBT community at my Highschool, but there are only two transgender people I know of and they're both freshman, although this shouldn't hinder me, it does. I feel like if I ask them for help with my identity, my pride will somehow be affected. I also, being a Junior, have little to no connection to them other than that they are both in my organization. On the terms of pride, I don't care that they are Freshman, I'd just say that I feel a little bit of envy that they have their stuff together and already know who they are even though they are younger than me. I also don't know if they would even feel comfortable talking to me about it and I don't want to cause any form of dysphoria by bringing up that they are trans.
  In the end I'm just struggling alone. I do have the support of some of my friends but they all believe that I am Gender fluid Because that's what I've been classifying myself as. Recently though, my friends have questioned if I was trans and I don't have a proper answer. I'm trying to figure myself out on my own but everyone is looking for answers on account of how I've been acting lately, which I understand because I stopped dressing as I use to, I shaved my head, I dropped different friends, and I've been more defensive than usual. 
""Are you depressed again?""
""Are you trans or still the same as you were?""
""Are you feeling more dysphoric or do you even feel it at all?"" 
  It's frustrating because all I can tell them is that I really don't know. I really don't know because I don't understand what the meaning of being trans is as I've never spoken to someone with similar experiences as me. 
  So I've gone to Tumblr, Instagram and now here to ask for someone to help me define what I'm feeling or even just to talk to me about this whole thing. I know you aren't supposed to talk to strangers on the internet but that's all I really have right now so I might as well give it a try. I would appreciate if someone in the trans community could give me some advice, thank you, no matter who you may be.

She‚Äôs one of the first people I came out to over 6 months ago, but we haven‚Äôt seen each other since Christmas. 

I‚Äôll be real, I could tell weeks ago that she didn‚Äôt want to hear about my transition. I tried to give her space with it, but it‚Äôs impacting my life in huge ways (got divorced, moved, changed jobs, family dynamics changing), so there‚Äôs no getting around it sometimes. I‚Äôm also just really fucking happy for the first time in years, and want to share the high points with her. I also want her to see who I really am, since I was so closeted and dysphoric and dissociative in college and for years since that I pretty much just lived according to a non-offensive, non-obtrusive script. 

Without too much detail, she came home very suddenly this week due to a death in the family, and I of course went to spend time with her. She made no attempt to use my pronouns or chosen name when referring to me with her boyfriend. I was shaken, but didn‚Äôt want to make it about me when she‚Äôs under stress. 

A few hours into hanging out, we went to a store and the clerk asked where ‚Äúwe‚Äù were from, evidently assuming we were a couple, and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from out of state, but *she‚Äôs* from here.‚Äù 

I was mortified, I‚Äôll be real. I pass, and I have been passing for a couple months at this point. I use the men‚Äôs restroom, present very run of the mill male, and no one I‚Äôm still in constant contact with misgenders me, even in private. I haven‚Äôt been called ‚Äúshe‚Äù in months. 

The clerk clammed up, looked down at her hands, and became pretty visibly uncomfortable. My friend didn‚Äôt correct herself and I left it alone since we were leaving. 

I told my friend after we left that I needed her to try with the pronouns, especially with strangers, since they see me as male - she acted shocked and asked when she had slipped up. I told her, but in truth she hadn‚Äôt correctly named or gendered me even once since we got together that morning. ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm gonna need some time!‚Äù It‚Äôs been 6 months, but okay. 

A few minutes later, she looked at her boyfriend and said, ‚Äúwhat do you think, she doesn‚Äôt look that different from how she looked last Christmas, right?‚Äù I was hurt, but figured maybe since she‚Äôs cis she couldn‚Äôt comprehend that I‚Äôm *happy* with the changes I‚Äôve had, but just told her that I pass well enough to use the men‚Äôs restroom without getting a second look. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the voice, then,‚Äù she said. 

That was pretty fucked up on a lot of levels, but I couldn‚Äôt react at the time. 

There were several instances of this kind of flippant behavior, and tbh there have been a lot when we‚Äôve talked online. I gave those a pass bc it was over chat and I didn‚Äôt want to read into it too much, but it‚Äôs stayed an issue and kind of came to a head the other day. I left hanging out with her feeling incredibly dysphoric and embarrassed, bc it became pretty apparent that she‚Äôs just ‚Äútolerating‚Äù what I‚Äôm going through and wanting to act like nothing has actually changed. 

I get being scared by change, but I obviously needed this enough to gamble my whole life and livelihood on it, and I lost quite a bit in the process. It fucking hurts that she‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs a phase and that occasionally going ‚Äúmm oh, right, *he* now, I guess‚Äù equals support. It‚Äôs becoming apparent that she thinks everyone in my life is just indulging me by using my pronouns, etc, and keeps rubbing it in that she can‚Äôt see me any differently and blaming it on her being unable to see physical changes (which is also absolute nonsense, because they‚Äôre pretty major). 

Ugh. I‚Äôm just worn out I guess.

This is the third time I'm putting makeup on and something goes wrong. Something that I just can't fix. Something that I keep trying to fix. Again. And agan. And again.

The only thing harder than starting all over (cleanser, toner, serum, eye cream) is explaining how fucking stupid I feel. Real people don't have these problems. Their relatives die or they don't know how to make rent or they try to save their marriage. They don't break down into tears because they can't get their make up right and they'll have to go out into the street actually highlighting the monstruosity they were pointlessly trying to mask.

If this has happened to any of you, I'd appreciate hearing your story. But deep down, I'd rather find out I'm the only one. Because I hope no one feels like I do right now. Or if they do, I hope it's over something actually worth feeling bad about. Not just because they're fucking broken and can't deal with everyday life.

I may want to transition to female.

Will my 1.5 year use of anabolics and androgens ruin my chances of ever having a feminine bone structure, or body hair issues? I'm 24, anyone know if that's too late lol?

Long story short I've never really felt like a man, and my first thought was, ""Hey, get jacked. Use steroids."" This has done nothing but make the problem far worse.


Like I think I look kinda feminine already except for being huge. Just don't want to have to get too much plastic surgery. I think I have a great ass and feminine face. Just worried about the bone structure or anything else I guess. I really want to chill on the lifting for a while to reduce muscle size.

I've been pretty confused about my sexuality for a long ass time, and I think I'm gonna start seeing a therapist about it. But I have never felt whole, and I've never really known exactly why. Just this all encompassing depression that's lasted most my life.

So i have a question about amab/afab - i understand how the terms are used and what they mean, but why say 'assigned' a sex instead of a gender (assigned female as opposed to assigned girl)?  

I can understand how a trans person was assigned an incorrect gender at birth.

I can understand how an intersex person could be assigned a Sex.

But a MtF trans person was not 'assigned' any Sex, they were a male at birth. They were assigned masculinity or boyhood. gender is assigned, sex is not. claiming you were 'assigned' a sex (assuming you are not intersex), isn't nearly as accurate as saying a MtF is born male, is girl, is assigned boy at birth.

I realize it seems a little nitpicky but its pretty crucial and core to the way people identify themselves. So my question is where does this come from? Am i failing to realize a good reason for this?

Ive been in a really great relationship with a girl whom I wouldn't trade for anything or anyone.

She's told me before she's wanted to be a guy for pretty much her whole life and that she was planning in changing her name and pronouns soon, and possibly later on start using hormones and all that.

I've been fine with it and Im not transphobic, but after a lot of thinking I figured I wouldn't be attracted to her any longer and this just really put a lot of panic in my as I didn't want this relationship to end.

I told her how I felt this morning, and she had a couple mental breakdowns throughout the day because of it. She told me she had to choose between being with me who she wants to spend the rest of her life with, or finally having the identity she had always wanted. She had also told me that the thought of her being a guy and still being with me really excited her.

I felt absolutely terrible because of this, but we talked about it for a while and she figured she would be happier with me as a girl than being a guy without me, and that she was glad I didn't end the relationship to let her be a guy (which I told her I considered doing)

But even after this has gotten cleared up, I still just feel so so guilty that I just can't be attracted to that and that as much as we like to say otherwise, if we aren't asexual then physical attraction does matter in a relationship.

336,2018-10-24 18:00:00,9r21jw,0,1,"Hi all. Like many of us in America, I'm gravely concerned over the recent developments from the Trump administration. Even if it's just talk, it's distressing to have our legal existence be a subject of debate.

Therefore, I want to try to put the news into perspective. Right now it's easy to imagine radical changes in America such as legislation that restricts or bans transition related care, and I've even heard some people half-jokingly talk about trans people being put into camps, but (as far as I'm aware) neither of those things is likely to actually happen.

This brings me to my first question: what is the actual worst that could happen? Let's assume, since this is a worst case scenario, that the Republicans retain control of both houses of congress until at least 2020. Given the current political climate, what anti-trans changes could we realistically see in the next 2 years? Please back everything up with facts; I'm asking this to try to put the fear-based rhetoric that has been saturating our community into perspective.

My second question is whether or not I should have a backup plan. Suppose the Trump administration or congress or the courts or all 3 actually put us into the worst case scenario. At what point does it become reasonable to start considering emigration? What other options are there? What countries would be the best to migrate to? How bad would things have to get for trans Americans to be considered refugees?

337,2018-10-24 18:10:15,9r2551,0,1,"I've been hiding who I am for about 2 years since I started exploring my identity / sexuality. A few know I've been married to a woman before, but that ended a year and a half ago (divorce just finalized, yey?). 

I work for a university, which should be a pretty safe place to be myself, but I don't have a ton of co-workers I would consider friends. They're all mostly stable, married, have children. A few are late 20s, early 30s (my age range) but again, all are straight (as far as I know) and married. A lot of them go to or talk about church, but I haven't heard anything too conservative or demeaning from them.

However, I'm getting to the point where the little comments are starting to irk me. Like, just now, a female co-worker was kind of stretching and made a yawn sound that another across the hall thought was feminine, and they both kind of joked how it wasn't me. Little tiny things, I wish I had more examples on my mind.

I feel like some of them do get the sense I'm a little feminine or a little different, but maybe they're not trying to offend me by asking who / what I'm into and just assume I'm straight and a dude? I've been growing my hair out for a little while, it's just above shoulder length. I try not to wear any collared shirts to my office, but I don't wear like tighter jeans or make-up or anything. 

I'm getting really close to hormones (about to store sperm on Friday for the first time), and I've kind of been waiting until things get started to be like ""Hey, I'm actually _____"" and ""you should call me Carrie"", but I'm not sure if that's the right method. I wish I had someone at work I could talk to, and I'm sure some or most will accept me, they just literally don't know.

Hi, first time poster here. I'm a 21 y/o trans man, and I'm currently studying abroad in a foreign country. I'm very lucky in that I was able to have my gender marker changed to M before the move, so I didn't have an issue with getting overseas. For the past two years, I've rarely been ""clocked"" by strangers, so I'm currently living stealth (not obligated to come out as trans).

Unfortunately, when you hang around young-age groups that are entirely straight and cis (primarily cis men), they get up to a *lot* of offensive jokes. The derogatory comments are almost always about trans women - mainly joking about ""traps"", leading into gay jokes. Occasionally there's also the stupid ""I identify as an attack helicopter"" line, ""Did you just assume my gender?"" and other annoying ones like it. These are people that I share a residence with, so it's hard to avoid being around them. 

So far I've bitten my tongue, either ignored it while others laughed or abruptly changed the subject, but it's becoming more and more unbearable. I hate to be the person that makes things uncomfortable, but hearing these comments every day is making me genuinely dysphoric. 

Basically, my question is: Should I come out to them so that they'll understand why the jokes bother me? I don't necessarily want to do it as a ""Gotcha!"" where the point is to make them feel bad, but more like ""I'm trans, this is making me uncomfortable, and I'm asking you to stop"". I know deep down that some of these guys are nice, but my biggest worry is that I'd just become the target of more ignorant comments.

I have identified as many sexualities and haven't ever really settled on one, and prefer not to label myself. Recently I was called out and bullied off of social media for posting that Being nonbinary doesnt make you transexual. Was I wrong for this? I have always thought nonbinary was its own group and experience. I was informed that nonbinary falls under transexuality. So the question is this. Is it not wrong to appropriate the experience of someone who has such a different life? Someone who has higher suicide statistics? Someone more likely to not be accepted by their family?
I have ALWAYS believed this, starting when I realized I didn't feel like I fit in my body. When I came out as trans, my family wasn't very accepting, they were constantly trying to explain me to family members and friends in embarrassment. Eventually they accepted me, but even then it felt bregrudgingly. 
I also felt incredibly hurt by the people I thought were my friends. I felt like I couldn't share my beliefs, and was told that ""I just don't see how someone who was trans could say that gender nonbinary individuals can't be trans.""

To start, I'm Flynn. I'm an 18 year old ftm guy who lives with his parents. 
A few months ago, I came out to my mom and dad as a trans guy. My dad said he'd need therapy if I pursue transition if he wants to keep being my father. He also said that, even with therapy, he doesn't think he'll ever be able to refer to me as he, and that I'll always be a girl in his eyes.
My mom, probably due to her extremely conservative upbringing, had a much harsher reaction. She firmly said she wouldn't be paying for any transition and, along with saying things about how if I transition I'll always be a freak and that my late grandfather would hate and disown me, told me that I'm not allowed to transition socially or medically while I live under her roof.
Since then, I haven't mentioned anything about gender for fear of being yelled at or even punished. She acts like everything is normal, like nothing has changed, calling me she and even frequently referring to me as 'the girl'. Knowing her, I don't know what I was expecting. I'd somehow managed to trick myself into hoping that they'd accept me, which was clearly a mistake. Looking back, I'm lucky I wasn't kicked out. We've had plenty of fights since then where my gender wasn't mentioned, but was clearly the real source of tension.
Eventually, hiding who I was got to be too much for me. Despite what my mom said, I've impulsively changed my name on my social media accounts (they don't follow me) and asked my friends to use said new name. It may have been stupid, but I don't regret it. I'm trying to keep it hidden from them, as I don't currently have the means to move out and have no idea where I'd go if I could. When my parents find out, which I'm sure they will, there's going to be hell to pay.

I'm at a loss for what to do. If anybody has any advice on how to keep my social transition hidden from them, please let me know! And, failing that, if anybody has any ideas for how to deal with them finding out, that'd be great.
Thanks so much for reading all this.

368,2018-10-26 04:22:33,9rhklq,25,1,"First let me state that I am not transphobic and have no objections of any kind about hiring a trans person to work at my company. The purpose of this post is to ensure I am doing everything I can to make sure this person feels comfortable with my company and the process.

I guess I should start by saying I do not actually know for certain this person is trans. I will refer to this person as a female because that is how she presents - just a normal late teenage girl. The name on her application is a typical male name, which leads me to assume she is transgender. I have not talked to her except as a customer, and have never talked about personal details.

1. When I call for an interview there will be no acknowledgement on my part that she is anyone other than the name on the application.
2. When I begin the interview, how should I address the issue of a female standing before me with a male's name? Would it be appropriate to start with ""Do you prefer Joe or Joseph"", or should I as a more general question like ""What name to you prefer to go by""?
3. Assuming she does not say anything to me about being transgender I will proceed with the interview as I would any other applicant.
4. If she does tell me she is transgender, would it be inappropriate for me to ask any questions such as ""What is your pronoun""? Would there be any others I should ask or avoid?
5. Assuming the interview goes well and leads to a job offer, would it be inappropriate to as something along of the lines of ""What can I do to make sure you are comfortable working here""? Because I would have to deal with legal documents, would it be inappropriate to ask if she will be legally changing her identity in the future?
6. If she is working here and a customer makes a transphobic comment, would it be inappropriate for me to step in and come to her defense? My initial reaction would be to handle it the same way I would if someone was sexually or racially harassing one of my employees.

I have never knowingly interacted with a transperson in the real world. I want to be sensitive, helpful, and accommodating, but I also don't want to cross any lines that would be inappropriate. Thank you in advance for answering these questions and adding any other thoughts  which might be helpful. 

My company is very open and friendly to the LGBTQ community, but we have never hired a transgender person before. Since we are a small company there are no specific HR guidelines to guide me on this issue aside from general sexual harassment training.

The purpose of this post is to ensure I am doing everything I can to make sure this person feels comfortable with my company and the process.\n\nI guess I should start by saying I do not actually know for certain this person is trans. I will refer to this person as a female because that is how she presents - just a normal late teenage girl. The name on her application is a typical male name, which leads me to assume she is transgender. I have not talked to her except as a customer, and have never talked about personal details.\n\n1.

When I begin the interview, how should I address the issue of a female standing before me with a male\'s name?

I've always been keenly aware of the gender divide in the world, particularly in regards to its treatment of women as a lesser class of being. Growing up, I rejected a lot of stereotypically feminine things (dresses, lace, growing up to be a ""good housewife"") but thoroughly embraced others (glitter, rainbows, animals, taking down the patriarchy). I found the ""soft butch"" label to be fairly close to describing me for a while. I strongly identified with women, and still do...just a different idea of women. Fierce, powerful, take no frickin prisoners women. I would often comment on my gender though as ""I'm just me."" This is long before public discourse included words like genderqueer and non-binary. 

Then times changed. Now we do have those words. I picked up the genderqueer label pretty quickly, and had a good friend that shared this with me. We were like twins in a lot of ways. It was the first time I had someone who I thought felt the same as me. He later transitioned to Male, but is still very queer and open about what it means to be male. Since I felt this shared identity, it sent me into hyper-questioning mode. We haven't been hanging as much (due to life, not his transition) so we've drifted a little and haven't had a heart to heart on gender in a while. But the ""who am I"" questions continue to plague me. 

I'm a naturally masculine woman...narrow hips, battling facial hair since middle school...but have DDs. I dont hate my chest, but sometimes wonder if I would like a flat chest better. Even binders don't do much, and they effin' hurt. And I've not been terribly pleased with the top surgery results I see online on bigger bodies with bigger breasts. Not exactly encouraging.  

I don't care if people refer to me as he or she ...but honestly neither fits. They feels like too much work, too much constant explaining and correcting. When the others don't bother me terribly, why go through the trouble? 

There's also the nagging memory of a brief time in college, before I came out as a lesbian, when I said I was a gay man trapped in a woman's body. Seriously I had met maybe one trans person at that point and was only newly recovering from a conservative upbringing...I hung out with a lot of gay men and honestly I could be described to this day as a little flamboyant. Not sure if it was a by product of my crew or just my unique spin on life. Also, memory is hazy, and I may be overstating the length or importance of this statement. It very well may have been only a couple weeks that I said this...and shortly thereafter met my first girlfriend. I am very rarely attracted to men, but if I am, they are effeminate or gender-variant in some way. I love all gender transgressors, TBH. 

Which is why this is so confusing to me...outwardly I have all the love for all the genders. Inwardly, I may have some internalized transphobia (see conservative upbringing). Or, I am overthinking it all and I am just me, like I have always said.

So I came out to my parents, and it did not... really go well. I'm not disowned or kicked out of the house, but I was talked over the entire time, and I feel as though I was not heard. I'm thinking of just setting up an appointment for an intake at my local LGBT center for HRT without even talking to them. I'm currently taking some space from them after coming out, it was a very emotion fueled night, and I need time to heal, but I feel as though they should know before I even start because I'm using their health insurance (I'm 22). I'm afraid that if I don't start HRT now, it will be too late, as testosterone has already done enough damage to my body and image already. I'm also worried though that if I don't talk to them about this in a space where I can be heard, I will lose their trust and possibility of acceptance entirely? I've already socially transitioned, I go by a different name, she/her now, etc. I feel so much happier and better than I did a year ago (when I first figured out I was not a boy). Am I being a bad person by just going around the people who raised me because they're scared and haven't processed everything yet, even though I'm ready to just continue onward?

I was recently telling a story about a trans-lady I know, but about an event that occurred pre-transition. Pre-transition they dressed and behaved very stereotypically masculine, and now behave and dress very stereotypically feminine. I wasn't sure whether to refer to them by their dead-name and previous pronouns, or how they choose to be known now - as using 'she' seemed wrong when I knew them as 'he' at the time of the story.

Sure I could in future have a conversation with this person: but in a situation where I don't know how should I approach this/what would the trans amongst you prefer if you were the person being talked about but not in the room.

410,2018-10-28 21:18:05,9s6uc0,0,1,"So i just want to note, this is a on throwaway account because i dont use reddit much and i was unsure about asking this, i also want to remain anonymous 

I have a friend who is going through the transition (to female) but is having quite a lot of pain in the lower abdominal area, as well as in both testicles (she has not had surgery yet to remove testicles(genitals as well, idk if that would be relevant). Shes also has had low (and irregular blood pressure). 

When we have both talked about it, i wondered about the possibility of her having both sets of organs (a uterus and ovaries, as well as having testicles). From what she has told me in the past, testosterone did not effect her very much. Not only her puberty hitting very late (late 15, nearly 16) she only had minimal changes from testosterone, her voice changed only slightly (she sounded female before hitting puberty) and her emotions were affected but that's all we really know of. What i do want to also note is that she massively changed on estrogen, that she looks fully female now and doesn't look masculine at all. On a small side note, she also had very wide hips before puberty 

When we talked about it more and were discussing what it may be (this was before she started to have lots of pain, ill explain that later in the post) she had all the symptoms of  klinefelter syndrome (Xxy) and we were both confused by that a bit, of course not really thinking about it because it wasn't a huge concern. 

I do want to note because i believe this relates to this, she has been able to reduce how much cyproterone she needs to take (she tried reducing it as it was causing her depression to be worse) and eventually was as low as taking 2.5mg daily. Surprisingly with this she had 0 problems with testosterone and she has been taking this for months with no problems, shes only recently (about 5 days ago) increased it to try reduce the pain shes been having which unfortunately it has not reduced it 

 I do want to note, she normally takes 2mg of estrogen sublingually and has returned to doing so after this

About one month ago though she did a blood test where she didn't take estrogen for 35 hours (she did still take blocker) and then did the blood test, it showed that she had around 230pmol/L of estrogen which both of us found really odd. Since then though shes had pain that comes and goes in the lower abdomen area (where a uterus and ovaries would be) as well as in the testicles (often in the right testicle and sometimes in the left). Of course at first she didn't really say too much because it didn't bother her greatly but over time it got worse and worse and i talked to her about it

Quite recently (about 1 week ago) she was hospitalized due to the pain, and was rushed to the doctors at early morning and this is whats really gotten me concerned about her at the moment. As far as I've seen the pain is only getting worse and we still have no clue what the pain may be. While I think that it may be due to her having both sets of organs I want to ask on reddit if anyone else has any ideas as to what it may be. 

What i do want to note though is she had several tests done at the hospital. They found a spot on the liver that may be cancer but they didn't believe it to be harmful. They also tested her kidneys and bladder, as well as doing a ultrasound from her abdomen to lower abdomen to see if there was anything. They found nothing wrong with the kidneys or bladder and from what she told me, the doctor spent some extra time looking at the lower abdominal region but didn't say anything about it, they did also do a physical exam on her testicles but did not find anything wrong with them. At the moment they have only focused on the spot on her liver but we dont think it would be the cause of the pain (because we both doubt the testicle pain would be caused by the possible cancer on her liver, which hasn't spread(it was 6cm). 

My friend lives in the Netherlands and often has a hell of a lot of problems with the doctors where they haven't helped her properly or ignored her completely. So far they have completely ignored her about the testicle pain and dont really seem to be focusing on anything else other than the spot on her liver. At the moment its causing her a lot of physical and mental distress and both of us are trying to find out what it may be. I honestly am really concerned and am asking here because I wanted to see what other people thought and maybe if they can give any advice as to what we could do to try find out what it is. 

At the moment she doesn't want to go back to the doctors (and i dont want to recommend it to her either) because they have been sending her in circles and its not helping her at all, only making problems worse to the point of her not wanting to try anymore, I do also want to note that shes being treated by  VUmc and as I've said, they dont seem to help at all.

I am a girl, anatomically, and probably also gender-wise,

I was even asked whether I was trans once by a boy in my class, we must have been 11.  
I just turned my back and said nothing, but it made me so happy.

I just wanted to stop by to quickly say that the people of this community are on my mind and in my heart lately, and to let you know that there are people out here who believe 100% in your right to existence, happiness, love, freedom, and success.

I can't pretend to know what it's like to feel under attack for simply being who I was born to be, but I don't need to fully understand that experience to know that no one deserves it. For as long as there's still a fight left to fight, I and the millions of people who think like me are not going to let you and your friends and family fight alone.

The attitude towards LGBT issues in the latter has an air of the ""I don't hate gay and trans people, but I wish they'd stop shoving it down my throat"" lowkey kind of hostility.

The other night in the former group chat, two people came out as genderqueer, so I decided to open up too. Everyone was voicing how proud they were of us, and posted some general enby positivity, and it was so validating since the only people I'd come out to up until then (my mother and a dear childhood friend) had both reacted in a very lukewarm, ""I kind of understand this but I'm not calling you by your preferred pronouns because it's too hard for me"" way.

A couple days ago, someone in the shitpost-y chat mentioned me being nonbinary, and thanks to that, now everyone in that (larger) chat knows. When I tried to casually say ""yo so how'd you know I'm nonbinary anyway? I didn't think I'd mentioned it to you yet"" in as non-confrontational of a manner as possible, even saying I wouldn't be angry, he dodged the question twice. He currently lives with my aforementioned childhood friend, and they definitely have that kind of close friendship where you tell each other everything. Either my childhood friend outed me, or someone in the chat I came out to did, and scarily, I'm leaning towards my childhood friend.

I feel so betrayed, and the worst part is, I don't even know who betrayed my trust. Who else have they told? Will they take my secret to the rest of my family? What kind of scathing looks and snide remarks at the family Christmas get-together will I receive then? Or worse, what if this information makes its way to my employers? I've only known I'm nonbinary for a little over a year, so I'm still mentally processing everything and figuring out how to broach the subject. Now my ability to do so on my terms with my own words has been ripped away from me by someone who I entrusted with my secret.

It's past 4:00am here and I've been struggling to sleep over the last couple of nights. I've got that numb, almost out of body feeling you get when something awful like this happens. I haven't been able to get anything done, I keep getting distracted with thoughts about what's going to happen from here. I know it's not the worst tragedy I could face in the grand scheme of things, but it's still terrifying, mostly because of the unknown. Not knowing who else knows now, and not knowing who I can still trust.

I don't think there's much of a solution beyond waiting it out and privately asking my childhood friend if he told him, but the thought of doing that is awful when I'm already so torn up about this whole thing. I'm going to try to get some sleep now, hopefully having talked about this to someone who will understand will calm my mind down enough for some proper rest.

The whole thing feels like a roller coaster now.

I've felt a lot like sharing my worries with more closer people, mainly telling them to be supportive if I start becoming 'weird', and that while I may start looking like it, I'm not trans.

But I've abstained so far because I don't want to get more into what could be an error. They're all emotionally unavailable persons anyway, and they won't be able to help with my looks or clothing ‚Äînever did as males anyway.

I too haven't been able to try much until then. I'm taking it very slowly. The only thing I've tried was getting rid of my body hair, and while it was fun and exciting, that's about it, indifference ensued. It felt sort of nice to go out knowing I had no body hair underneath, but that's about it. Today I have a doctor visit, and I'm ashamed to be seen that way.

I'm also trying to get my hair long enough again to try a bun like I had when I was younger, but I don't have good hair anymore, so that'll be hard.

---

Right now, I'm back at wondering something I thought a lot in my early twenties, which was the absolute lack of femininity in my life.

As a kid and a teenager, I never had any female friends. My family was all masculine too, we were four brothers without girlfriends, and a mother that was everything but feminine. Nothing in my home was remotely feminine.

Since then, the only few FWB relationships I've had didn't bring me much of that either. While I liked them a lot, I wasn't able to get anywhere close to the female reality. They know I had image problems, but never took the risk of helping me out. They'd tell me I'm not masculine, but wouldn't care for me looking good as someone who wasn't masculine. 

Now, I'm mostly having trouble **sorting what I want in me and what I'd like in someone else**. I feel like this is a very deep and troubling question. I know love women, even if they're not feminine, but I am a person who is avid of knowledge, and I feel such a strong need to experiment this part of life that I never got remotely close it, and that because I won't ever be able to, I feel like I have to experiment it in myself. But at the same time, doing so in a way that affected my image, would be an humiliation, like publicly saying ""I've definitely become crazy"".

Because I have this strong identity void (I'm actually aiming to be tested for a Personality Disorder, potentially a Dependent and/or Avoidant one), it all feels like a fraud. Ideally, I'd become someone capable of having a relationship with someone that fulfilled me, but that won't happen anytime soon, so I think about becoming that mysel. But it feels wrong, as I know I am not a woman.

I'm also having some trouble sorting my sexual behavior from my gender identity. I struggle to sort out which part of all this is purely out of my sexual needs, from which could be part of my gender identity. I enjoy both roles in sex, I enjoy topping but also enjoy being topped, and when I'm topped I like to think of myself as a woman. I feel as if, when I'm not feeling any sexual urge, nothing of all this matters at all.

Instead of calling it a pseudohybridB (made up name for a type) why not just call it by its name, which is really the way to capture all that the car is, why not just call it Yamaha Porcupine 73?

Hey! It‚Äôs me Max. So right now I‚Äôm having really bad dysphoria about my voice and my appearance in all. I am gender-fluid and right now I‚Äôm feeling more on the masculine side. I haven‚Äôt come out to anyone and I have mentioned cutting my hair short multiple times to my mom but she refuses to let me get it cut. And I‚Äôve tried putting on a hat and tucking my hair in and I‚Äôve tried the same thing with a hood but it all doesn‚Äôt seem real enough. (If that makes sense) my voice is too high pitched for me right now too. I wish it was lower. And it‚Äôs just a whole mess. My face is really feminine looking which I hate. I have freckles and eyebrows that look like the kind all the girls draw on now a days. It‚Äôs like I was born in the wrong body. I have a really round face too. And my whole appearance makes me feel less comfortable less myself. I‚Äôm tempted to grab some scissor and just cut it all off but I know I will regret that in the future knowing that it will look really bad if I do it myself. My mother doesn‚Äôt even like when I wear somewhat gender neutral clothes so I‚Äôm not surprised when she won‚Äôt let me cut my hair cut. And my voice is too high pitched. I wish it was deeper. I don‚Äôt like sounding so feminine. I mean I look so girly. My voice sounds so girly. Everything about my appearance doesn‚Äôt match what‚Äôs happening in my mind. It‚Äôs so annoying. I wish I could be taller instead of a short nub that‚Äôs only 5‚Äô2.  I wish I could be more masculine looking but no just my mind is and thats it.

It's very confusing and a little upsetting.

I need to know if what I'm experiencing is dysphoria, as just because I don't *like* gender, doesn't mean that I can claim to be nonbinary (I've heard that that would just mean I'm a gender nihilist.). As a kid, I just kind of thought of myself as me. I never thought, 'oh, I can't do this or that because I'm a girl.' I just did my own thing. When I was introduced to the concept of genderless characters as  kid, I was elated. Like, that was the coolest thing EVER to me. Fast forward, I find out about genderfluid people online and I also think that they are the coolest people ever.

Fast forward even more, and I'm hating that I've gotten older and can no longer be seen as 'me'(even though as a kid I thought I was breaking gender roles, despite me dressing as the gender I was assigned at birth). I've always taken the 'male' part of a song (even though I'm pretty sure that has nothing to do with dysphoria) without thinking twice about it-- it was natural for me. I imitated male singers, and made my voice go pretty low (although I can't really do it now, bummer). I've always thought my 'female' characteristics are useless, as they will never help me do anything in life, especially considering I don't want children. Whenever someone talks about these characteristics, I get enormously upset.

I'm OK with being referred to as a boy or girl, but would generally prefer people seeing me as a person. I don't think I've ever acted like how people expect me to act, and people tell me all the time to be more 'feminine'. After exploring myself more, I've also come to realize that I wouldn't mind wearing masculine or feminine clothing, despite preferring to wear what makes me comfortable (usually masc. Clothes, seeing how they get to wear pANTS), but I love the look of feminine clothing. When I was younger I would stuff my hair in my hat and pretend I was a boy (or at least a girl dressing as one), but when I got older I realized that the illusion was lost. Sometimes I wear masculine/androgynous clothing and feel very happy... even attractive, which I've never seen myself as.

69,2018-10-20 02:39:57,9pqhlb,18,1,"Hello, I'm still questioning things.

Some background:

Sometimes I kind of wonder if I just *wish* I was genderqueer/nonbinary so that I could be interesting/special. I mean, I'm AFAB, and I don't find the idea of being a man or a guy or a boy appealing at *all*, and I guess I'm okay with the idea of being female/a girl/a woman. However, while I feel more attached to female than male, I'm not really attached to it. I don't really feel like I want to be a ""_ girl"" or ""_ woman,"" even in neutral contexts like ""a dark-haired girl/woman"" or ""a young woman."" I've also been contemplating things like breast reductions, but I'm still deciding on that.

I've been wondering if I should ever want to take steps to explore this socially, such as perhaps using another name. I'm too scared though since almost everyone that I haven't talked to about gender knows me as female. I don't want to lose them as friends, and I'm worried they might be calling me by another name/using different pronouns just to ""humor me"" and treat it as a joke. And I don't want to look like I'm doing it as a joke or as a trendy thing either to any trans people... And also, I don't think my parents would like me to change anything drastic. My mom wouldn't care about surgery, but the rest of my family knows me only as female, and I don't want to lose them either.

78,2018-10-21 19:34:50,9q6ekx,3,1,"Hey everyone! :)

I ran into some serious gender identity issues in the past few days, and it seriously confuses me and I really want to know if I can legitimately consider myself ""non-binary"" or ""genderqueer"" or if I'm just a tomboy as many other girls. 

I'm just gonna list some things that made me questioning my gender throughout my 17-year old life:

* When I was a toddler, my clothes would usually have the colors blue and red. I also had a pink-phase for some time, but it didn't last that long.
* I prefered my hair short my whole childhood
* I liked toys directed at boys, especially cars, but I also played with dolls on occasion. I almost always prefered the happy meal toys directed at boys and was really upset when people told me they were for boys or when things I didn't like were said to be ""for girls"".
* When I was in elementary school, I just couldn't befriend the girls in my class no matter what I did. I didn't understand their obsessions with cute animals, and I prefered playing with beyblades along with the boys. I felt like I belonged more to the boys than to the girls. I didn't want to sit at an all girls table in class and immediately asked my teacher if I could sit at the boys' table.
* In secondary school, I began hating some forms of feminine clothing, especially skirts and dresses, what none of my female friends could understand. I didn't even wear a dress at prom. 
* I felt out of place when my female friends started talking about guys in a romantic and sexual manner.
* When I befriended some guys again, I was relieved that they had the same interests like me. They never critisized me for my clothing choices or how I presented myself, and it seemed so much easier to talk to them due to the same interests.
* From the time on I turned 16, I was never seen in a dress or skirt again. I tried wearing both at some points at home, but I felt really uncomfortable in them and it felt like I was wearing a costume.
* I started becoming disgusted by my female biology. Since then, I feel disgusted by my breasts and started wearing sport bras to make them appear as small as possible. I'm considering getting a chest binder soon.
* By now, my clothing choices mostly consist of jeans, (cropped because I'm short) hoodies, sweatshirts and t shirts, with only a few more feminine looking tops and pullovers.
* Not only do I reject my breasts, I also reject my whole reproductive system, and the thought of me being theoretically able to get pregnant makes me so anxious and disgusted that I consider getting sterilized when I'm 20.
* Even though I don't like my female body, I just know I wouldn't feel comfortable in a male body either because I'm as much repulsed by male genitalia than female, so transitioning is nothing I would like to do.
* If I imagine my perfect body, it would have a male-like chest, small hips and female genitalia but would be infertile.
* I feel highly uncomfortable with traditional female gender roles and get angry even at the thought about them.
* I don't have a problem with it when people talk about me as she/her or being called a girl, but it doesn't feel right to me being called a woman or being adressed as ""Miss"". This point doesn't really matter though, as my native language (German) doesn't have any gender neutral pronouns I could get back to.
* I think I experienced slight dysphoria in rejecting the sex characteristics I listed above.

Whether or not it takes off is up to chance.

gender and sex are divided in this system.

Gender including masculine, neutral, and feminine \[for pronoun use\]

Sex including male and female \[for health/sports/legal use\]

&amp;#x200B;

An abbreviation for an id would look something like 

|MM|NM|FM|
|:-|:-|:-|
|MF|NF|FF|

Its neither the infinite gender utopia nor the binary utopia for either side, but i do see it as a agreeable middle. Please feel free to criticize and hopefully through discussion this can become something more than a post on the net.

I‚Äôm a sys male and although I can sometimes see myself as having gems in qualities, I don‚Äôt personally feel I struggle with who I am, how I define myself or how others see me. 

We do have some wonderful friends who are gender fluid. I want to truly understand the issues of gender and sexuality in a way where I can use the correct terminology, pronouns, and also be sensitive and aware of how I can be a support to them and to the community.  

To do that I feel like I need a bit of an education so that I have the groundwork to even begin to talk about these subjects in an intelligent/sensitive way.  

I wonder what you would all recommend as resources to start understanding the terminology and issues. Are there great websites, books, wikis, etc that give a good broad overview in a way that is balanced and up to date?

[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/8qmuv5/update_periodmenstruation_dysphoria_journey/) tl;dr A record of 2-3 months of change.

I have been using the birth control pill Altavera (0.15mg Levonorgestrel and 0.03mg Ethinyl Estrodiol) to ease my period symptoms since the beginning of May 2018.

Months 1-4

I had to experience a lot of spotting in the first 4 months, plus other weird symptoms to get used to the drug. This is something I had expected and I wanted to take things slow and see how my body reacted to normal use of the pill before switching to continuous use. See Update 1 for details.

Months 4-6

I am now a little more than 2 months into continuous pill use. I have been spotting everyday since beginning, but have decided that light spotting is better than having to deal with something resembling a period at this point. A part of trying continuous use was to manage my raging hormones around the week off the pill during traditional use. I have noticed improvement, but I also recognize that I was going through issues with my IBS/anemia that may have made things worse.

Speaking of IBS, I have noticed that I get a cramping feeling more often when I eat foods that I shouldn't have. After years of thinking that my uterus was the problem I'm starting to think that my cravings at that time of the month may have caused most of the pain. I will be continuing to use the pill on continuous mode through the holidays, but once I get my diet figured out I'd like to go back to taking a break for a period every 6-9 weeks so I don't have to deal with spotting all the time. If it's not painful, I can deal with wearing tampons during a period.

Future Plans

I am beginning to think that periods less often might be easier to deal with, considering my options right now. There's also been a lot of my time spent exploring my feelings about having a masculine/feminine side and I am starting to embrace my femininity more. These feelings mean that I'm more tolerant of the menstruation cycle and no longer feel like I'm not in the right body when I pull down my pants and see blood every time I need to pee.

I have always recognized my genderlessness to be mental and I have stayed strong in knowing that I want to support my body's natural functions as much as possible. Dealing with a period, despite being genderqueer and childfree, has opened up my mind to learning about bringing balance between the tug of war I have been feeling for so many years. I believe that if I can manage my IBS symptoms then I won't have pain during my period and can feel less disgusting using tampons. This will be the next experiment in my journey when I can see how I feel about all these thoughts.",genderqueer,Update 2 - Period/menstruation dysphoria journey,1540751186.0,"{'created_utc': 1540725986, 'id': '9s2htn', 'num_comments': 6, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/8084of/periodmenstruation_dysphoria_struggling_to/) tl;dr The beginning of the journey, asking questions.\n\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/8qmuv5/update_periodmenstruation_dysphoria_journey/) tl;dr A record of 2-3 months of change.\n\nI have been using the birth control pill Altavera (0.15mg Levonorgestrel and 0.03mg Ethinyl Estrodiol) to ease my period symptoms since the beginning of May 2018.\n\nMonths 1-4\n\nI had to experience a lot of spotting in the first 4 months, plus other weird symptoms to get used to the drug.

The psychiatrist I'm seeing as part of my transition said that his impression is that I'm a nonbinary woman, which to me sounds odd as in my head nonbinary and woman are two different thing and you can't be both at the same time. Maybe I'm wrong on that, but the way he describes it, that's a person who is very close to the woman side of the spectrum, but occasionally likes to express themselves in a masculine way, which isn't entirely incorrect for me. I never feel an urge to wear masculine clothes, but I also have male coded clothes that I really like!

If nonbinary woman is simply the gender version of hetero-/homoflexible in sexuality, then maybe that's where I am. But there's also a feeling of indifference to it. I don't really feel like I care if I count as a woman, or a nonbinary person who is just really, really close to the female end of the gender spectrum. Labels are just a tool for me, to help explain how I experience the world. I'm also pansexual, but have no problem using bisexual if I'm talking to someone who is likely to not know what pansexual means.

I also know there's a difference between gender identity and gender expression. And I at least feel like my gender expression is probably more fluid. I tend to gravitate towards womens clothes, but I'm also fine with mens clothes, especially if there's a nice looking pattern on it. If it's just a plain t-shirt, I go for the womens section, but if it's a male coded piece of clothing with a cool pattern on it, I might chose to wear that.

Long story short, I'm a guy in his mid20s. I believe I was born into the ""right"" body. I am in touch with both my masculine and feminine side. I am working toward my phd and have a wide and accepting circle of friends. There are almost zero external negative influences in my life. I eat decently well and exercise regularly.

That said, when I do exercise, I am mostly concerned with developing the legs, glutes, and waist. I own more dresses than dress shirts, and at least partially crossdress usually most of my days. I have and am decent at applying makeup. I have very long hair that I got balayaged.

I am attracted to women. Men can look handsome, but I have never really had a sexual urge toward another man. I enjoy looking at and being with women. I know gender identity and sexuality are different; I just want to clarify that I am very confident in who I am and there isn't much confusion in my life other than the following:

I said I was born into the right body. However, I am desparately infatuated with the idea of having wider hips and a more feminine face. Basically, if there was a god who could swap my gender, I would tell him/ her / them ""I'm happy being a man, and I'm happy with the body I have, but if I can look like the type of woman I'm attracted to / I'm trying to be through exercise, then yes please I'll trade in this body."" I'd switch in a heartbeat. I don't mean to put this in a crude way, but basically what stops me from wanting to be a woman is (1) with current medicine I don't think I could look like the kind of woman I want to look like (the idea of not passing or passing-but-they-kinda-know is scarier than just being the average dude I am right now), and (2) I've already built a great life for myself as a man and am happy with it and don't have much desire or need for an overhaul. I just sincerely ache for a more feminine body.

In my uninformed opinion, I think the summary is that I'm not trans, but am definitely not totally certain with my situation. I am not very well-versed in the proper vocabulary, so of course I'm sorry if I've upset anybody. I've been told before that I may be genderqueer / genderfluid, hence why I'm posting here (and if I'm not, getting others' opinions is still incredibly helpful).

127,2018-10-31 18:46:51,9t1mne,0,1,"Hi everybody. I¬¥m sorry for my bad english. I¬¥m 21F and thinking about, what I am. My heart ist beating so fast while writing this.... I always say to friends, if they say, I¬¥m a handsome girl, that I¬¥m more like a boy. And sometimes I wear clothes from boys. I really like suits. And if I wear those clothes, I feel so secure, because noone would hurt a man, right? I¬¥ve tried to walk at night like a man, wearing the clothes of my boyfriend. And sometimes I wear those clothes at home. If I feel like I would be more like a man on this day. This sounds to me pretty genderfluid but if I think about,that a few months ago, I was thinking about buying a breast binder to be more like a man, it sounds so different.  I remember when I was 7 years old. I stood on the fence of our garden and thought ""I will be a man. Like the men in the magazines wearing their suits. But I can¬¥t be a man if I don¬¥t know how it is to be a woman"". I don¬¥t know if this thought was because of the good looking of this men or just because most of the time I feel like it. But after this moment, I never thought about it again. But when the puberty began, I saw how I became a woman and I hated it. I tried to hide it from my mom and thought a long time about it, to talk to my grandma about that. I hated it to bleed. I just... don¬¥t even know why. And if I think about how I changed, I always felt like sombody could hurt me, just because I have a vagina. I even couldn¬¥t spraddle my legs. A long time, when I thought about my hole body, I just couldn¬¥t touch it. Maybe it¬¥s because I had anorexia since I was 7. Maybe it¬¥s because I just think, the female body is disgusting. In my eyes, vaginas look like dead animals or something like that. I just feel, like somebody could hurt me because I have that. Long time I even couldn¬¥t say the word vagina. I said vagigi or just pointed with the finger down there. My last boyfriend helped me, to love my body. So for the first time I could touch myself without thinking it¬¥s so disgusting. Sometimes I weard men clothes, because I knew that he has no problem with it. He knew that if I say, I¬¥m feeling more like a man, it just is that way it is. But he¬¥s gone and became bisexual. So that remembered me of all this things, that happened and how I feel most of the time and that¬¥s why I¬¥m now thinking again of all this very difficult and stressful stuff. I somtimes have dreams in which I am a small little boy, blond hair and about 7 years old. So I thought, this could be because I feel like a man. But because of the situation about my ex, I have the feeling, this could all just be more like a phase. Like I¬¥m an attention whore. And I have a friend, when I told him, I feel more like a boy, he just recommended ""some people are saying this for attention"". And this made me so angry and panicky, because, what if I am this kind of people. And at the same time I¬¥m thinking about, if I would be a man, I would wear women clothes, because I like corsages and Highheels. So I like my body more than before because I know, I can wear those close and look good in it.

&amp;#x200B;

I posted about this about a month ago but wanted to remind folks as our first videos are starting to come online this month! I'm really excited and proud of those who have been taking part. :)

Here's the info: 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm starting a new collaborative YouTube project called ""Queer and Disabled.""¬† My goal for this project is to bring visibility and lift up the queer community discussing gender (non cis) and disability. Before you think, ""I'm not disabled,"" I ask that you read on and then decide, especially since we are looking for more volunteers from all over the globe and all walks of life. The project is geared¬†anyone 18+ who sits outside the cis gender box, like transgender men &amp; transgender women, intersex, gender fluid, gender queer, androgyne, bigender, agender and non binary (not a complete list, brain fog is real, lol)...you get the idea (except otherkin),  who also deal with mental, learning, hearing, visual, intellectual, &amp;/or¬†physical disabilities¬†or chronic illnesses, whether visible or invisible.

Below is our video introducing the project (it's our first so please be kind, it takes a little time to get used to speaking to YouTubers lol). Note: I understand many don't consider themselves ""disabled enough"" to be considered ""disabled"" but that's part of the project as well. Trying to throw off the stigma behind various disabilities to show even if we do deal with different issues when it comes to our gender identity, both visible and invisible disabilities are valid.

If you have any questions or you are interested in participating, please email the project at [daqueer@outlook.com](mailto:daqueer@outlook.com)

6,2018-10-03 21:25:48,9l5j11,6,1,"So, I'm AMAB, 34, just recently (last few months) realized that I'm not-exactly-cis (see my post history for more). I've settled on ""genderfluid"" as a self-descriptor because there are times when I feel (and like feeling) masculine, and times when I imagine myself as a woman, and I'd like to explore more feminine things.

I got back into therapy to try figuring all this out and had my first session yesterday, and one thing that came up really was like a needle into my questions and insecurities and anxieties since I started this process. One of my main concerns in this process has been how to explain things to my wife. When I imagine the conversation and explaining that I don't want to transition, I just want to find ways to express my feminine side. And right now, my only real ideas for that involve clothes and makeup (so if anyone has suggestions...). So I imagine her asking if I'm saying I'm a crossdresser, and I don't know how to make a practical distinction, or if there really is one. For most of my life, I wasn't really interested in wearing women's clothes, and it's only since I figured out that I'm not cis that I've had any real drive to do so. 

My therapist asked me why I'm hung up on that term and that distinction, and I identified that there's a lot of stigma around crossdressing, and that I associate it with dressing for sexual reasons, which he said isn't necessarily true in his experience working with people who crossdress. 

It's been sticking in my head all day, and it's kicked up a lot of doubt and discomfort (which I already had plenty of to start with). I think a lot of it has to do with thinking that this part of my identity was just a fetish for most of my life, and if I can't separate it from crossdressing, which also (in my mind) is a fetish thing, then maybe it really is just a kink, maybe I'm just a cis guy with a weird fantasy life after all. 

And then I had a little epiphany that if I'm genderfluid/nonbinary, how can it be ""crossdressing""? But if I still present &amp; identify as male socially, then how can it not? Am I just creating a female persona to wear around the house? 

Basically, I'm curious if other genderfluid people have dealt with this anxiety, if/how you make a distinction, or if this is a hangup that I need to get over. Or if you think I'm just a cis dude with a kink.

9,2018-10-04 01:43:36,9l7jp6,0,1,"For about 12 years until just this week, I identified as a (cis) lesbian, but felt compelled to accept that I'm not totally cis. I have usually presented as a lot more femme than butch, worn feminine clothing and jewelry, and often get mistaken for a straight woman even by members of the LGBTQ+ community. That's how I've felt most comfortable appearing most of the time. When I've worn a more masculine outfit or let too much body hair grow, I've felt less comfortable with myself--most of the time. 

I now realize that some of this discomfort around masculine expression is internalized stigma on top of emphasizing the times when I've felt feminine. I've had memories come up these days of the sense of being classified strictly as a girl as a child and conforming to a female identity throughout my life, even after coming out as a lesbian. I've often pushed down those parts of me that didn't align with that female identity.

Occasionally, such as this week, I'll feel masculine. During these times, I wish I looked like a guy and didn't go by a feminine name or pronouns. I've seriously questioned whether I was trans at times. I don't feel that I am, at least not a trans man, as I have no persistent dysphoria, though I do have some at times. It's like I have Schr√∂dinger's gender, as another user put it. Talking about this side of me really seems to bring it out. I'm really curious as to how it would be to have a penis and am inclined to try out a packing one like a lot of trans guys wear.

Then, there's my sexuality. I like feminine people and women and not men. That, and especially when I engage in sexual activities, I find myself wishing I had a penis.

I wish I could switch parts at will sometimes. That's my dream. My understanding is that this is not a typical cis lesbian experience.

One thing that has quite pleasantly surprised me as that a friendship with an awesome straight cis woman has grown into something more.  We currently define our relationship status as friends with benefits.  Anyway, we've worked up to having sex at least a few times a week.  It is quite good and enjoyable, but I've found that we have a more or less inverted the roles on who can orgasm the most.  She orgasms most every time, whereas it has been very difficult for me to do so.  In fact, I have only orgasmed once, and it was from a very good hand job where I was able to completely relax and enjoy myself.

I'm very well aware that my brain works like a female in some aspects, but I'm beginning to wonder if it includes how I relate to sex as well.  I've been hesitant to say this because while I know I can be quite good in bed for the right lovers, I've always felt that I went the extra mile in doing what it took to make the sex good since being genderfluid is more often than not a disadvantage.

I'm 21, in college, have really awesome supportive friends, and rich unsupportive parents. I came out to them last December and they think that I'm just a crossdresser who needs Jesus. 

Due to my parents paying for my college and fearing that they would kick me out, I haven't started transition. They have said if I don't respect them and follow their rules they would. I haven't been the most obedient child. I've lied and almost gotten kicked out of college due to my depression and bad grades. 

So the thing that has made me question and think I might be genderfluid is that I have never been uncomfortable with myself looking male but I haven't ever connected with masculinity in a deep way. I definitely prefer she/her pronouns. There are days where my dysphoria is more pronounced, but there are days and in most settings where are times I'm perfectly comfortable being seen as male. I have been thinking I could live with being male on the weekdays and in professional settings and then be out with my friends and dress more femininely on the weekends and at home.

So, I am 28, and have spent most of my life as a straight cis man, and only recently (last year or so, maybe two) realized that I‚Äôm bisexual, and even more recently, have been taking a hard look at my gender. My spouse recently came out as nonbinary, so I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about that, but I‚Äôve never felt dysphoria around my gender and never felt euphoria about being referred to by other pronouns, so I don‚Äôt think NB really fits me. After some conversations my spouse suggested I look up gender fluid and it seems maybe to fit better but I‚Äôm still feeling uncertain. 

I think I started having moments a few years ago where (only when I wasn‚Äôt being watched) I would ‚Äútry on‚Äù behaviors that I considered to be feminine or flamboyant (like walking with my hips or letting my hands dangle down at the wrists, etc.), but never really explored anything more than that. Then recently, I found myself feeling like I wanted to be on the receiving end of PIV sex, and started fantasizing about it. Very recently (like the last few days/weeks?) I‚Äôve found that to be more consistent, and a few days ago (after probably weeks of wanting to buy not finding the right time) I tried putting on makeup for the first time (not counting a theater performance I was in in high school), and felt pretty good with it on. Other than that I‚Äôve also been experimenting with taking pictures of myself that make it appear that I have female anatomy (is that PC?). I also have been playing with my walk some, and noticed myself feeling a desire for people to perceive me as a woman, but she/her pronouns still don‚Äôt feel right, and part of me still feels like I‚Äôm just playing with it and playing the part rather than it being somehow my truer deeper self.

67,2018-10-17 20:01:15,9p236o,0,1,"I know I like to say that labels don't really matter to me all that much, but it's also starting to hit me that I'm in my last year of undergrad. I know college seems like, feels like, one of the better places to grow into oneself, but that doesn't change some things. I still have to deal with this university being in a small town, though the university itself is very accepting. I also would have to deal with my family and community back in my hometown. So I really want to know for sure with 100% confidence before I change anything, even though I know it isn't likely.

I'm not even really sure what to say about myself. I don't think I've ever really identified deep down as female. I basically grew up a boy just because my parents gave up on me being a ""girly girl"". I didn't really become more feminine until I hit puberty and figured that was what was expected of me. I remember freaking the fuck out over my first period because I was told that my body was ready to make children and that I was becoming a woman.

The current me gave up on femininity almost immediately, I doubt it was even there at all, more of me just faking it. All I really did after that was grow out my hair and wear dresses and skirts more often. As I grew, my height stopped, my body curved, and my chest grew. I've hated it ever since. My body in general. I hate my curves and chest because I can't wear the clothes I like. Even when I was at my ""optimal weight"" I still hated it. I guess I've grown to tolerate it because I have to live in it, but that doesn't make it enjoyable. I say that I'm okay with things like my hair, that I'm not willing to give them up, but at the same time not being happy looking like this.

I've tried making subtle changes to how I dress. I've always ever worn variations on jeans and a t-shirt. I've started wearing boxers and briefs when I can, though it makes the feeling even more obvious that something down there feels missing. When it comes to dress clothes (formal and business casual) I primarily wear something more andro because I'm done with dresses (for the most part) and I don't feel comfortable trying a suit or tux just yet (I really want to). I dread the day I have to start wearing blouses or dresses/skirts because I can no longer pass t-shirts or long sleeves as dress tops, and my chest prevents me from wearing button-ups. My body doesn't allow me to wear what I see as myself without it coming off in a way I don't want it to. But I'm also afraid of people asking questions because of the way I'm dressed.

I guess my biggest point of confusion lies between who I really am and who I'm expected to be. I grew up in a really religious community where you're only allowed to be male and masculine, or female and feminine, no mix-and-match. So I also have to wonder if I'm just a woman who really wants to be more masculine and do what I want with my life, no more of this ""father always has to protect you and provide for you, you're never allowed to leave the hometown, just stay and marry a man and make babies"". Which, to be honest, I really want. So friggin badly. But I also have other things to consider. Like how I've felt this past year, and really over my lifetime, as described above. I guess I just feel like I'm trying to fool myself into thinking I'm a man when I really want to be more masculine. I've always been told that women like certain things and men like others etc. But since I got to university and grew the fuck up, I discovered it's perfectly okay to like whatever the fuck you want. I could be masculine and love cozy fuzzy stuff.

But I've gotten to the point where I can watch videos of people transitioning, I watch men becomes themselves and it makes me happy, and it also scares me that I would have to go through that. I watch women become themselves and can't stop wondering why they'd give that up, give up what I want for myself.

I can picture 2 versions of myself in the future, a man and a woman, and I'd much rather be him.

I'd love to talk this out to someone, but the counseling center at my university is under the impression that psychology majors like me can't have any problems and that we just want attention or know too much. And the people I know who are trans or anything but cis can't seem to see me anything but straight and cis.

I've also been considering if maybe I'm just not on the binary because my feelings seem to fluctuate sometimes in intensity. Like sometimes I do feel okay being female. Other times I hate myself and being female. Most times I just exist somewhere in-between.

No matter how strongly I feel what I feel though, there's always that part of me who grew up in a very conservative religious place, a part of me who I fear will never change or fully accept who I am.",genderfluid,I don't even know anymore,1539831675.0,"{'created_utc': 1539806475, 'id': '9p236o', 'num_comments': 0, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'I know I like to say that labels don\'t really matter to me all that much, but it\'s also starting to hit me that I\'m in my last year of undergrad. I know college seems like, feels like, one of the better places to grow into oneself, but that doesn\'t change some things. I still have to deal with this university being in a small town, though the university itself is very accepting. I also would have to deal with my family and community back in my hometown. So I really want to know for sure with 100% confidence before I change anything, even though I know it isn\'t likely.\n\nI\'m not even really sure what to say about myself. I don\'t think I\'ve ever really identified deep down as female. I basically grew up a boy just because my parents gave up on me being a ""girly girl"". I didn\'t really become more feminine until I hit puberty and figured that was what was expected of me. I remember freaking the fuck out over my first period because I was told that my body was ready to make children and that I was becoming a woman.\n\nThe current me gave up on femininity almost immediately, I doubt it was even there at all, more of me just faking it. All I really did after that was grow out my hair and wear dresses and skirts more often. As I grew, my height stopped, my body curved, and my chest grew. I\'ve hated it ever since. My body in general. I hate my curves and chest because I can\'t wear the clothes I like. Even when I was at my ""optimal weight"" I still hated it. I guess I\'ve grown to tolerate it because I have to live in it, but that doesn\'t make it enjoyable. I say that I\'m okay with things like my hair, that I\'m not willing to give them up, but at the same time not being happy looking like this.\n\nI\'ve tried making subtle changes to how I dress. I\'ve always ever worn variations on jeans and a t-shirt. I\'ve started wearing boxers and briefs when I can, though it makes the feeling even more obvious that something down there feels missing. When it comes to dress clothes (formal and business casual) I primarily wear something more andro because I\'m done with dresses (for the most part) and I don\'t feel comfortable trying a suit or tux just yet (I really want to). I dread the day I have to start wearing blouses or dresses/skirts because I can no longer pass t-shirts or long sleeves as dress tops, and my chest prevents me from wearing button-ups. My body doesn\'t allow me to wear what I see as myself without it coming off in a way I don\'t want it to. But I\'m also afraid of people asking questions because of the way I\'m dressed.\n\nI guess my biggest point of confusion lies between who I really am and who I\'m expected to be.

I think if I would ever come out my parents would kill me but in some ways I think this would be good for the environment maybe some other partners would agree with me that pushing your queer kid of the stairs would be a good idea.

Sometimes I get harassed at work for being so undecided but maybe I shout get my shit together and think like a normal not mentally challenged person.

After all I think I'm a man and all you queers need immediate medical attention because 20 genders doesn't exist and you have to be regarded to think this way.

Currently, and for the last three months, I figured myself as non binary, demigender(woman). However I'm feeling myself change and I'm not sure why.   
AMAB, but do not want anything to do with male/masculine stuff. I'm on hrt to feminize, I try and hide masculine traits, and just be comfortable in my skin.   

However I know I'm not a woman. I don't feel like one, I don't want to be one, I don't want to be labeled as one... But my gender shifts very closely to that of one, so I felt demigender was pretty accurate. I'm very much andro/middle/none, and sometimes femme. It changes. Sometimes in the same day. Sometimes I'll be one for a few days. It hasn't caused too many issues because my style is that of comfy clothes and not really femme stuff like dresses, so I've been able to be comfortable.    

But something is not right and I don't know what. I'm beginning to doubt myself a lot. I'm getting a tiny bit dysphoric about thinking of where my breasts will grow to, yet a few hours later or the next day I'm happy and excited to see where they go. I'm happy about my body and then I'm hesitant.    

My shifts between femme and neutral are starting to become more noticeable and it feels like they are different things, instead of a bit of the two.     

Again, sorry. My brain is just a mess and I'm trying to think things through, but after reading this over it doesn't seem like I've thought much through at all.      

I guess I just don't know where I stand or what. Does *anyone* have experiences similar to this? I'm just so confused on how to feel about how I feel right now.     
I know genderflux is a term, but I don't really understand the percentages explanation so I don't know...

I'm happy about my body and then I'm hesitant.    \n\nMy shifts between femme and neutral are starting to become more noticeable and it feels like they are different things, instead of a bit of the two.     \n\nAgain, sorry. My brain is just a mess and I'm trying to think things through, but after reading this over it doesn't seem like I've thought much through at all.      \n\nI guess I just don't know where I stand or what. Does *anyone* have experiences similar to this? I'm just so confused on how to feel about how I feel right now.     \nI know genderflux is a term, but I don't really understand the percentages explanation so I don't know...  \n\nSorry, and thanks~\n"", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Does fluid have to be from one binary to the next?', 'created': 1540343559.0}"

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to start by saying that i love my dog and would never do anything to harm her, she is my princess and i truly love her, she is my best friend and has been since i rescued her just over four months ago. 

so, this all started a week ago when i decided to remove her penis. ive been contemplating doing this for a while now through the traditional method of visiting the doctor for surgical procedures but i found some articles online of how to do it safely at home and being pretty broke and not really able to afford the surgical option, it was our only real choice. 

now let me back up as to why i decided to do this. my dog (which is a beautiful yorkshire terrior) always seems to gravitate toward female dog toys, treats etc. and just has an overall female personality and i think she even looks more like a female dog more than anything (i refuse to use the word bitch to refer to any living being i just feel like its so disrespectful) anyway i used a similar technique as people do when they remove dogs tails, which is basically restricting blood flow then removal. foward to today and shes doing really well, theres still a little blood but it seems to be healing well overall but my problem is my family. theyre absolute nut job conservatives, i mean theyre not the type to vote but they hold  those sort of ideals and theyre really freaking out and threatening to get my princess removed from me and are constantly calling me and saying im crazy.

92,2018-10-24 20:44:05,9r3izg,6,1,"Am I genderfluid? - That's the question I asked myself four months ago. Looking back, the answer was a clear yes, but I had my head so far up my own ass that the idea never occurred to me. I had convinced myself that I was perfectly cis, and there was no way in hell that I could be anything else. I was wrong.

It started out when I was twelve, with a dream funnily enough. In the dream, I was at my grandmother's shop (A women's clothes shop) and I was playing hide and see with my cousins. As I hid in the changing room, I noticed a pretty dress, and for some reason, I felt the urge to put it on. I did, and suddenly transformed into this beautiful woman. I felt sexy, confident, and amazing. I woke up two seconds later. Pandora's box was opened. 

At the time I didn't think much of it. It was a dream after all, everyone knows dreams are weird right? But it kept replaying in my head. Looping time after time, how amazing and freeing it felt, and I started to get curious. (Even now I still remember that dream vividly) 

The feeling of wanting to be pretty lead me to crossdress for the first time, and a whole new world suddenly opened up. I looked and felt pretty, and I wanted to do it more and more often. Shortly after I noticed a magazine that had been left lying around, and in the magazine a woman was modelling a beautiful swimsuit. I found myself wanting more than anything else to be her. To be able to dress up exactly like her, look like her, and pose like her. So I started to to research. And that's when the trouble began. 

In theory it sounded perfect, I would transition, and life would be dandy. But a part of twelve year old me asked myself ""But I like being a guy? Don't I?"" And just like that doubts poured in. I became afraid, terrified I was forcing myself into something that I would regret. I quickly decided to stay a guy buy crossdress, because that's totally ok right? It totally won't come back to bite me in the ass.

So I kept on crossdressing in secret. It was fun. I eventually moved on to blouses and heels, and practiced walking so that I could move around without breaking my ankles. I even started to get into makeup and started to teach myself how to apply eyeshadow. Then I made a mistake. I grew in confidence, and naively modeled one of my sister's dresses to my brother. That same night he told our mother, and the questioning look and confused sound she made broke my heart. There and then I swore I would never crossdress again. 

Time passed, and I figured I was over it. At this point I was sixteen, and struggling with depression (unrelated circumstances). After a long battle, I was slowly getting better, and in the midst of it I started to wonder about crossdressing again. I wanted to feel pretty once more, but I didn't want to steal my sister's clothes for fear of getting caught (plus puberty hit me like a truck while my sister is petite). So I started to search online, and one day I made a friend. She seemed sweet, and after we became good friend she told me she was transgender and planning to transition. This blew my mind. I had so many questions, but didn't want to bother her, and deep down a part of me wondered whether I was actually jealous of her, but I kept that hidden deep down. 

As I got to know her better the idea of transitioning no longer seemed as taboo, but I still had that echo of my mother's words, and didn't explore further. Instead I started to look up gender bending fiction. This served to heighten what I now realise was dysphoria, but I thought I found the key. By relieving myself sexually I was able to stop feeling bad! What a great idea!

This cycle would continue to haunt me for five long years. Each time I would get the feeling of dysphoria, I would take care of business, and feel better after. It didn't matter that it would come back later, all that mattered was that I was ok then. 

But like every addict, I could never reach that high. As I found myself unable to stop the dysphoria through my normal methods I kept on going more and more extreme, until I reached a point where I was becoming in danger of losing myself as a person outside sexual gratification. That point was 9 months ago. 

After once session where I came down fairly quickly from the high I looked at myself, and was disgusted. I was wasting my life, and was acting pathetically. I quit cold turkey, and it sucked. A lot. After some relapses I decided it was time to end the ""feitsh"" once and for all and forced myself to stop consuming any and all media related to genderbending. 

Things were looking up. I was past the ""reset"" period for any sort of sexual addiction conditioning, and had started to come out of my shell. Then the dream happened. 

(Note I tend to suffer dysphoria when I am stressed out)

During my examination period, right before a very tough exam, I had a dream. In the dream, I had decided to transition. My mother was next to me, supporting me all the way, and she was telling me she was proud to have me as her daughter. I was ecstatic. A year passed, and I was now looking incredibly feminine. I had breasts, and curves and looked every part the woman that I had aimed to be. Then out of nowhere, it suddenly felt wrong. I didn't want to go back to being a guy, but at the same time being female didn't fit perfectly. I wanted to be both at the same time for lack of a better word. 

I woke up in a cold sweat and realised that something was different. This wasn't going to pass. After doing some digging, I learnt of this subreddit and the concept of genderdfluidity. I then logged onto reddit, and made my first post here.   

Since then things have changed for me. After having an open talk with myself I have improved in many aspects, however I have slid back into those bad habits on a few occasions (namely when I find myself questioning my gender identity). 

Right now the big argument I am having with myself is whether I want to transition or not, but that is a post for another time.

99,2018-10-25 13:43:58,9raf4b,3,1,"Hi.
Im a person who use most of my time contemplating different antropological, political and sosial issues. I stumbled apon a tread arguing the consept of gender. No to be clear before i ask my question, its just out of curiosety to hear the community opinion on a subject that two sides care deeply about in different directions. No i beleve that the world exists of mostly people not realy xaring what others call them self. But the issue, of at least what i have read and heard, seems to be that the word gender is used in different ways. I also understand that its a issue with rights like dressing rooms toilets and so on, but lets leav that aside for the moment, becaus its sutch a hard subject to discuss, due to both sides having valid points, maby one day we will have evolved past shame and can deal with this as a normality, but untill than, ceep fighting that battle. What i want to discuss is more triveal, the word gender it self. Ok, so the word in origin actualy has a broad and not so definable meaning, even going beond female male ore something in betwin ore past. Than the word got into the english language where it went on to be a description of sex (meaning the physical genetalia we are born with male, female and hermaphrodite) than it seems to me that in resent time, with more openess in parts of sosiety its beeng presented as meening something else, a description of a feeling (of sort) than the part of sosiety that do not wish to partake in this new found openess dissagree, with the ""right"" of the word already having a sosial lingustic meening witch is allready ""agreed"" apon and understod. So thats the conflict. Now it seems to me to be a impossible task changing the minds of those with there mind allready made up in this regard, and for me, a outsider in this matter, ""as I said I dont care if you have a vagina, feel like a man ore if you are gay ore straight and want to use the shower next to me ore be my friend, as i find gender and sex to be irellevant in any normal sosial settings."" But for me it seems counter constuctive to partake in this arguement, as any argument should have a forseable solution ore conclution, now it would ve reasonable to assume (like I do) that the conclution is that the two sides dissagree and do not agree to do so, and have their mind set on a screaming battle. Historicly the gay comunety whent through a fase that can be compared, simplefying it a little but bare with me. A gay man was called a faggot, devaluing his life into that of kindeling, wich is the true meaning of the word, the gay community have in different stages changed the defenition in a lingual sence to the point where its about to become useless to presue for those who apose, altho ppl try. And the word faggot to most ppl is now a frase more than a defenition of sexual orientation (not for all ppl, but I can see this is the way its headed) now the way they changed the meaning was and is by defining them self in a different mather, like queer. Now to win the part of the arguement conserning the word it self, would it not be more practical to create a word that have the defeniton you use to define gender? And let the narominded ppl have their word! I meen, if someone created a wird with a defenition that can not be argued. And that leves more room for this comunity to aprotche the aspects of your sosial challenges, witch in return will be of more value to your ultimate goals. I will take the liberty of suggesting ""Sensu"" wich is taken from the Latin word for feeling, nobody can argue somene elses feelings, so it would be fitting. So instead of gender fluide its sensu fluide, ore any verity anyone wishes. This way you at least get the opertunety to define your self without anyone having the opetunety to say thats not true. And ultematly win the gender arguement. 

Hopes no one takes offence, if you do, im sorry for not understanding the issue, it can be hard to understand all aspects of something from the outside, and this is done with the best intent.

Historicly the gay comunety whent through a fase that can be compared, simplefying it a little but bare with me. A gay man was called a faggot, devaluing his life into that of kindeling, wich is the true meaning of the word, the gay community have in different stages changed the defenition in a lingual sence to the point where its about to become useless to presue for those who apose, altho ppl try. And the word faggot to most ppl is now a frase more than a defenition of sexual orientation (not for all ppl, but I can see this is the way its headed) now the way they changed the meaning was and is by defining them self in a different mather, like queer. Now to win the part of the arguement conserning the word it self, would it not be more practical to create a word that have the defeniton you use to define gender? And let the narominded ppl have their word! I meen, if someone created a wird with a defenition that can not be argued. And that leves more room for this comunity to aprotche the aspects of your sosial challenges, witch in return will be of more value to your ultimate goals. I will take the liberty of suggesting ""Sensu"" wich is taken from the Latin word for feeling, nobody can argue somene elses feelings, so it would be fitting. So instead of gender fluide its sensu fluide, ore any verity anyone wishes. This way you at least get the opertunety to define your self without anyone having the opetunety to say thats not true. And ultematly win the gender arguement. \n\nHopes no one takes offence, if you do, im sorry for not understanding the issue, it can be hard to understand all aspects of something from the outside, and this is done with the best intent.\n\nSorry about ny english writing, not even my second language 0,o', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'A question from a outsider', 'created': 1540500238.0}"

Describing his/her quasi-dysphoriness.    
Sharing a photo.   
 

Really, really nervous to do this as it's my very first post here.  But I wanted to say hi and.... well... I don‚Äôt know. I guess this is me hoping to join the community and make some friends.

I‚Äôm not typical as a trans person (I'm a trans person??? eeek! I've never said that), in that I only started questioning, educating myself about three years ago in my late 40s. In fact, I'm still wondering if I *even am* trans or just.... I don‚Äôt know.  Just an odd bird. 

I don‚Äôt feel like a woman but I really enjoy expressing a feminine side. I like how presenting as a woman allows me the means to explore feminine behaviors, feelings, etc without the cognitive dissonance of seeing a man in a reflection or being seen as a man by others.

And although born with typical male anatomy, I don‚Äôt completely feel like a man. I never really have. In fact, throughout my teens, into my twenties and through two more decades I periodically would wonder, ""am I a man yet?""  Weird, huh.

As far as dysphoria goes... I honestly don't know if I have it. I mean, I don't have a disdain for my male dangly bits.  I like my five-day whiskers... I think I look kinda cool with my week long beard.  But, the times that I have presented as female, changing back is really... I don't know, I wouldn't say depressing but... it hurts. I don't like it. I want to stay that way a little longer. I heard the Gender Rebels podcast girls call it ""Cinderella Midnight"".  But once I'm back in boy-mode, I'm ok.  So, I don't know... I don't think I have dysphoria.  

Soooo I'm adding a photo and this is what I look like.... sort of.  You know, if you count filters, smoothing some lines here and there, thinning my eyebrows, slapping on a wig, doing some digital FFS by narrowing my face shape, removing some jawline, adding cheeks, nose contouring as well as big time makeup.  

So besides that... **totally** me! LOL!  You know.... Just your basic look of a genderfluid, enby,  who sometimes likes to femme it up.

Gender fluidity and the concept of being non-binary has fascinated me for a while. Mainly because I have found it difficult to understand, and partly because I want to understand.

I'm always on the side of people following the path that makes them comfortable, with the usual caveat of it not causing harm to others, so I hope I'm not offending anyone with my upcoming thoughts and questions. Having given this issue a lot of thought I'd like to ask the following:

1) Why and how does the spectrum of gender, differ from the spectrum of character/traits/experience of being a male or female?

2) By identifying as gender fluid, are you not by default defining what it is to be male or female, and therefore limiting the spectrum of male/female experience?

3) Would/could it be empowering to broaden the perception and expectation of what it means to be biologically male or female, rather than distancing yourself from what you feel society expects of those genders? Would your disassociation from those genders be lessened if a broader spectrum of each of those was more readily visible and accepted in society? 

Hoping to hear some responses. Thanks.
