9,2018-11-01 13:11:25,9t9a1b,3,1,"I had posted this in r/androgynoushotties and someone recommended that I post it here.

When I was younger, I always found myself attracted to tomboyish women who were confident. This usually lead to me having crushes on lesbians more often than straight women.

Just for context- I am a genetic male and the world sees me that way. I am okay that people call me cisgendered even if nonbinary may seem like a more accurate definition. I sometimes feel like I want to be a girl and other times I like being a guy. I am an attractive guy to others but I'm also a masculine guy. I don't find that masculinity attractive. I would love to look androgynous. I think who I am as a person is both a guy and a girl's mind. That mentality. I don't care whether the world accepts that or uses any specific pronoun. I just want to be happy with myself.

My presence here also has much to do with satisfying my curiosity. I love having a better understanding of why people feel and behave the way they do. Understanding others helps me better understand myself. In the past few months I've picked up an interest in researching quantum computing, quantum mechanics, and quantum physics. Everything is quantum. There is so much I don't know about the subject but I try to learn as much as I can because I strongly believe that it's only a matter of time before quantum computing becomes mainstream. And when quantum computing becomes mainstream people will stop thinking binary. Classical computing operates on a binary system. Which has worked great for a long time. When people feel that qbits are common sense they will have a better foundation for understanding complicated gender identities and sexualities.

Binary thinking enforces this fallacy that if you aren't one thing then you are the opposite. That's a fallacy. If it isn't day time than it's nighttime completely disregards early morning and evening. Quantum physics makes it understandable that something can be YES and NO or 1 and 0 at the same time. When something is measured, it collapses into a state of 1 or 0. I encourage everyone, especially people who are interested in a more progressive world, to research this subject.

If you understand our universe, you will understand the humans in it and you will better understand yourself. You and I are the same. My right hand doesn't stab my left hand because it is different. Two parts of the same whole. Find someone who believes the opposite of you. Understanding someone who you disagree with will make you stronger and could possibly encourage them to better understand you. The right hand and the left hand can lift so much more together than they can independently of one another. 

I love reading about conservatives like Steven Crowder and Mark Rubio- not because I agree with them but because I disagree with them. I am a neutral person. It's hard for me to empathize with the right or left because I feel for both sides and wish both sides would aspire to be more tolerant of each other and better communicate with one another.

18,2018-11-02 03:20:13,9tgiiw,6,1,"Hello everyone, 

I haven't really posted here much, I'm mainly a lurker. But I know info on T+Fin is of interest and very hard to find especially from the nb angle.

Sorry I don't have a video. I am too self-conscious to do vid updates :S

Note that I am also on Wellbutrin (have been for a while) which is known to affect things like libido (though usually increases it, which I did not find to be the case for me) as well as other potential things T/Fin might have affected, so keep that in mind.

Some background: I started T and Fin at the same time. I'm on 50mg of T cypionate subq weekly and 1.25mg of Fin daily. I am 5'4"" and 120lbs, pretty petite and very ""cute"" in a way that has people vastly underestimate my age. I am 29 and have never passed as male no matter what my hair and clothes are. I have pretty wide hips and smallish chest, so I'm starting out here with a figure that'll never pass as male without some serious help. My starting voice is pretty high and pretty Californian and if I try to through it lower I just sound like ruby from steven universe lol.

What I wanted from T: voice, muscles, change in body shape, and a better self image, more energy

What I didn't want: body hair, facial hair, losing hair, bottom growth, high sex drive, the supposed thicker feeling skin? That's kind of whatever but I like my skin how it is so. Being smelly. Acne. 

Anyway so with all that in mind here is what has happened over 3 months on T+Fin.

&amp;#x200B;

Hair:

* No changes in body hair. The actual hairs haven't gotten thicker/darker, nor has more of it appeared.
* No facial hair at all.
* I feel like my head hair is thinner? Which it really shouldn't be... so I'm thinking it's just psychological or because I've bleached it too much lately. I have really thin and fine hair to begin with. My hair is not my glory lol.
* I haven't noticed a change in hairline, but I started with a pretty masculine hairline to begin with.

Voice

* I don't think my speaking voice has changed as no one has commented on it, but I can definitely sing several notes lower than I ever could before. So whatever changes there have been a gradual thing, no cracking, nothing sudden.

Body:

* I have noticeably larger arm muscles. I can feel them even when I am not flexing. 
* No bottom growth (I think?)
* Period is regular.
* Maybe libido increased a little? Nothing really dramatic. Some people on T say you get dramatic orgasms lol. This hasn't happened. I am ace and started with a low libido though.
* I don't know if I've had any changes in body shape. My pants fit the same. Maybe my shoulders have more muscle, but that I think is all if anything.
* Body smell hasn't changed. Pee smell maybe? But it isn't dramatically noticeable.
* Yeah pimples :( But I have struggled with them as an adult so much that I have been on low dose accutane on and off for a while, and was for the first month or two but ran out a few weeks ago and the pimples have come back nooo but so far have been manageable.
* No changes in hands or feet.
* Face looks the same I think.
* Skin feels the same.
* Energy level is the same.
* Appetite is the same.

Mental:

* I haven't noticed any significant changes in how I feel mentally or emotionally.
* I think I'm a little sleepier. I was really sleepy the first week but now it's leveled out, although when I hit my bedtime I'm really ready to sleep.

So I thiiiiink that's all I really have to say...

**TL;DR better arm muscles, can sing lower notes, no other significant changes yet.**

I will try to post an update again in a few months.

If you have any questions, you can ask, though I don't really have much more to add.

I know it's fallacious thinking — that an eyeshadow palette isn't worth trying out because it won't heal me from an abusive relationship, that I can't wear those jeans to that occasion because I'll still be too scared of my own shadow to post pictures of myself online, etc., etc. — but I still can't get out of the disgusting, pseudo-Christian worldview that it's okay to stay miserable and not make anything of this life, because eventually I'll get a better one. I hate this myth. I'm still hung up on it. I don't know what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes anyone else get feelings like? What do you tell yourself? How do you motivate or trick yourself into taking action / taking any direction at all even just for the sake of changing something rather than nothing?\n\nFor what it's worth I have ADHD-PI but feel more comfortable posting here than on an ADHD sub.\n\nThanks for reading.

Last year I met a trans men who, let's just say, hasn't got the nicest opinions when it comes to people who view themselves outside of the binary. We got into an argument and I told him I was genderqueer. I thought him actually knowing someone outside of the binary in person might help him realise that, yes, people like us exist and we're not just doing this for attention.

Yeah, that's not what happened. He's still against people like me and he outed me to my mom and the head of our LGBT support group. I did not want people to know, I was not ready to come out, and he knew this.

 I'm confused about how I'm presenting myself? Like, I'm not sure I understand if my internal dysphoria/queerness can be perceived (either by cishets or other queer people as well). When I see someone who looks queer, I can usually tell... can other people see that in me? Its really hard to gauge what I look like from the outside, I feel like I don't know what I look like?  Its stressing me out. Its really dysphoric and I feel like I dont actually exist. 

Lately, I've been thinking a lot about going on a really low dose of T just for a little while, I'm not sure though. I feel like maybe  I want to take T and estrogen at the same time or something?    idkk lol.

89,2018-11-05 21:25:20,9uhs00,2,1,"Hi, I'm afab and have identified as cis ever since I learned the word. As I've grown as a person, become more accepting of others, and learned more and more terms, I've started wondering if maybe cis female isn't actually what I am. 

Why I might be:

I'm definitely more feminine than not, but being a girl has never been super important to me. In elementary school most, if not all my friends were boys. I rejected pink clothes, preferred ""boy toys"" like Transformers, and only asked for Barbies if they came with pets (I loved animals). I would toss the doll aside and play with the horse or dog instead. Sometimes I would use the Dolls as Pokemon trainers, but never played with them the way they were intended. 

My mother called me a tomboy, but this has the connotation of being sporty and masculine. I never liked sports. I'm the only person of any gender in my immediate family who doesn't, and I never considered myself masculine. Maybe ""boyish"" when I was a child. But that only referred to my interests. I was a nerd. Nowadays geek and nerd are gender neutral, but when I was a kid, I was strange for not liking the things girls should like, and liking the things boys should like.

My name is feminine, but not the most girly sounding thing I've ever heard, and while I don't particularly like the sound of it, I do appreciate that I wasn't named Macy like my father wanted. My mom told me some of the names she wanted before she knew what sex I was. Tristan if I was a boy, and Cameron for either a boy or a girl. I prefer both of those over my own name. But I'm not sure if what I like is the masculinity/androgyny, or if they're just more pleasant sounding to me than my actual name.

When I was in middle school, I would often imagine I was a girl dressed up as a boy, tricking everyone and only telling the people she trusted. I think I got this idea from the episode of Fairly Oddparents when Trixie disguises herself as a boy to hide the fact that she likes comic books. I thought the need to hide her interests was stupid, but found her ability to pass herself off as a boy very interesting. I had similar feelings about Mulan (actually, when I was *very* young, I didn't even realize the men didn't know she was a woman for most of the movie. Completely missed the main point lol).

I never wanted to be a boy though. I never had any problem with my body other than the type of dissatisfaction that comes with weight gain from puberty. I realized early on that I wasn't straight, but gender stuff that wasn't cis confused me, and nonbinary gender confused me even more at first. 

But the more I learned about nonbinary genders, the less confused I became. But the *more* confused I became about them in relation to myself. 

Why I might not be:

Many nonbinary people's stories sound something like ""I identified as ftm for a while and that was better than female, but I still hated it. And then I learned the word nonbinary and immediately started crying because everything fell into place.""

As you can probably guess, this is not me. All the gender problems I've ever had have been pretty vague. A lot of it was probably internalized misogyny (I'm not like other girls) and some of it was probably internalized homophobia (boys like girls, but I like girls and I'm a girl?)

I haven't found a term that fits me. I'm not agender or neutrois or anything like that. I'm definitely female-aligned if I'm nonbinary at all. The closest I've found is demigirl, but I hate how cutesie it sounds (and demiwoman is so many syllables), and I don't think the ""partially this, partially that"" idea works for me.

Juxera is also close. But it's so uncommon it's hard to find Juxeras who have told their story so that I may compare myself to them.

I'm torn between ""everyone should explore their gender identity at least once"" and ""even if I find out I'm not a cis woman, is it even worth it? Because I'd still be so close to female on the gender spectrum""

This is mostly just me dumping my thoughts and feelings into the void. But if anyone has any advice I welcome it.",NonBinary,Why I might be Nonbinary vs Why I might not be,1541478320.0,"{'created_utc': 1541453120, 'id': '9uhs00', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hi, I\'m afab and have identified as cis ever since I learned the word.

Completely missed the main point lol).\n\nI never wanted to be a boy though. I never had any problem with my body other than the type of dissatisfaction that comes with weight gain from puberty. I realized early on that I wasn\'t straight, but gender stuff that wasn\'t cis confused me, and nonbinary gender confused me even more at first. \n\nBut the more I learned about nonbinary genders, the less confused I became. But the *more* confused I became about them in relation to myself. \n\nWhy I might not be:\n\nMany nonbinary people\'s stories sound something like ""I identified as ftm for a while and that was better than female, but I still hated it. And then I learned the word nonbinary and immediately started crying because everything fell into place.""\n\nAs you can probably guess, this is not me. All the gender problems I\'ve ever had have been pretty vague. A lot of it was probably internalized misogyny (I\'m not like other girls) and some of it was probably internalized homophobia (boys like girls, but I like girls and I\'m a girl?)\n\nI haven\'t found a term that fits me. I\'m not agender or neutrois or anything like that. I\'m definitely female-aligned if I\'m nonbinary at all. The closest I\'ve found is demigirl, but I hate how cutesie it sounds (and demiwoman is so many syllables), and I don\'t think the ""partially this, partially that"" idea works for me.\n\nJuxera is also close. But it\'s so uncommon it\'s hard to find Juxeras who have told their story so that I may compare myself to them.\n\nI\'m torn between ""everyone should explore their gender identity at least once"" and ""even if I find out I\'m not a cis woman, is it even worth it? Because I\'d still be so close to female on the gender spectrum""\n\nThis is mostly just me dumping my thoughts and feelings into the void. But if anyone has any advice I welcome it.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Why I might be Nonbinary vs Why I might not be', 'created': 1541478320.0}"

Since then the non-binary “thing” has grown a lot in me.

But using they/them pronouns doesn’t feel right , and using she/her is beggining to bother me, which makes me feel now perpetually uncofortable. I am more in the male spectrum than the female one, and though i don’t feel male it is bothering me a lot that even if i bind my chest people still see me as she/her. It is not that I want to be seen as male but I’d really appreciate if I could at least generate some confusion.

I haven’t really tried using male pronouns to refer to myself because i’m afraid it will generate tension with my partner. I didn’t feel this uncofortable with myself before and I don’t really understand what’s happening to me. I’n beggining to not be confortable with my name? Dunno. I’m beggining to really feel that masculine part of myself pushing and pulling.

Yesterday I felt myself actually feeling “trapped in the wrong body” for the first time. I’ve experienced dysphoria for years but I’ve always resisted the “wrong body” narrative for myself because this IS my body, and even though it causes me discomfort, it’s what I have to work with. Its taken me awhile to realize how much dysphoria I have as a whole (vs just my chest or my voice) and it’s so... strange to look in the mirror and feel totally disconnected and resentful of what you see. And it’s making me hate myself. 

It’s like being on T and experiencing gradual changes has made me finally understand that I do want a “male” looking body. And it’s so hard for me to accept that still. And I get more and more confused about my gender, because I really don’t feel “male” and don’t want to be boxed into the opposite binary box — but why do I want/need(?) a clearly masculine body so badly?

I thought I had a solid grasp of what it meant to me to be nonbinary, but I’m not sure who I am anymore.

I don't have bottom dysphoria in a traditional sense.

Having a full functional package? No. Having a half functional but full size package? No. But I wish I had a 2-3 inch wien. Why? No idea. It's not even practical for penetration, which is an ability I really wish I had. But I would feel so comfortable if I had a small dick instead of the vajene.

I was born a girl, and throughout pretty much all of my life I’ve “identified” as one, probably because everyone told me that I was one and I didn’t know that trans/nb people even existed. Recently in the past year or so I’ve began to come to terms with my sexuality after developing a crush on a girl, however I also learned about gender identity, and how people can be neither male or female.

I don’t think that I have any “sense” of gender. I don’t really have a feeling of “I am a girl” or “I am a boy”, I just feel like “me”, and have felt like this growing up, even before I started questioning. I’ve only talked to a few people (who are cis girls) about how I feel and they said they had a strong sense of gender. I don’t think I do. 

I don’t feel any significant dysphoria. I do feel a little strange/uncomfortable when people refer to me as “she” or call me a girl. I’m also not really a huge fan of my chest, but neither of these issues cause me any significant distress or upset, which makes me wonder if these issues are just kinda made up? However, the uncomfortable feeling I get when referred to as female especially seems pretty real, so this is a pretty good indicator that something’s going on. I also like to refer to myself as a “boy” as a half-joke, as it feels less awkward than referring to myself as a “girl”. I’d quite like to have a deeper voice as well (I once got jealous of a female voice actor who could voice a male with a deep voice).

I feel happy when I cut my hair short and I feel really happy and comfortable with shorter hair. I don’t know if this is just personal preference though. My clothing is pretty androgynous (I wear “whatever” and in formal occasions I feel a lot more “myself” wearing a suit than a dress. I like to wear makeup, but I don’t really see that as “gendered”. But then again, clothes/style don’t really matter too much as a girl can wear masculine things and vice versa.

I think that I might be agender or some other sort of non-binary gender, but I’m not sure, because although I can get by being seen as a girl, I would prefer a gender neutral name and pronouns. I’m not sure though as I’ve only really discovered these feelings recently.

Any advice on how I can know this for sure?

Our research aims to make the coming out experience a positive experience for future LGBT youth and their parents.

To thank them for their help, the first 300 parents will receive a $10 amazon gift card.

To be eligible to complete our study, which involves an online survey that should take about 20 minutes to complete, they must be able to read and understand English.

Some time ago I bought a binder from gc2b. It was a full tank-length style binder, and I liked it fine, except that when I sat while wearing it, the compression panel came down low enough that it cut into my tummy and made me look like I had the muffin top from hell. I later learned this is because the full-length tank styles were meant for people with more abundant breast tissue, which absolutely does not describe me. 

So recently I bought two more binders, in the half-length style. I like them quite a bit, the size is good, and for the most part, they're comfy. The problem is that now the bottoms roll/bunch up a lot, and at the end of a work day I've got bunched up material kind of digging into me, right around where the bottom bra band would sit. 

Turns out I've got a pretty short torso, all things considered; on top of that I'm very pear-shaped and that A-line flare (for lack of a better term) starts pretty high up. Is there anything I can do to help prevent binders from rolling or bunching up like this?

But I still have dysphoria around my body and not wanting some actual physical organs (like, I love having boobs, but, if I didn't have junk downstairs and it could just not exist on me, that would be awesome)? And like, my gender presentation and pronouns match my birth gender so I'm pretty sure I'm cis?

But I kinda also want to be physically sexless?

Is there a word for that? I don't really feel like it changes anything identity wise, but I don't know how to classify this and if it goes into nonbinary/agender/physically androgynous territory? Particularly if I don't feel like, as far as my physical body goes, I want to be ""gendered"" (I don't have the right word there I think, b/c it isn't gender that is the problem?). Like, my gender isn't the issue (I hate being misgendered with male pronouns when I have short hair), so it's the physical stuff that is.

Mentally I feel like a woman and love that aspect of myself... So is this even a thing? B/c I don't feel like nb fits me either because physically I just want to be off the spectrum entirely, but I'm not sure if nb is only applied to gender expression anyway and I'm using the terms wrong...

So how do you define this stuff and does anyone have links to things that can answer this? Is there another sub I should ask this? Is this even a thing?

Does this fall under the nb umbrella?",NonBinary,I'm looking for resources to get a way to personally label things for myself?

*Here's a bit of backstory if you're interested. If you've just come for the question, skip to the next paragraph.* The last few months has been a process. I've been slowly piecing things together and have come to realize I'm Non-Binary! Part of this process has obviously been about coming to terms with it myself and working out how I'd like other people to address it. I've been gearing my wardrobe toward a more androgynous appeal for a few years, so most of my physical appearance is already where I want (I just shaved my beard off this morning so hurray!). 

Now that I'm starting to come out to a few of my closer friends I feel like I have to figure out my pronouns. But here's the rub; I don't actually care. He, She, They you name it, I'll probably answer if I realize that you're address me. I've felt like this my whole life. I don't want to make this **more** difficult for those around me by not having a concrete answer. Everyone else seems very sure of their pronouns, and I don't want to take away from their experience/struggle by haphazardly suggesting it doesn't matter. 

So here's my question: *Does not choosing concrete pronouns hurt the community?*

I'm interested to hear the Reddit community's take on pronouns. Any suggestions for navigation this are also appreciated!

259,2018-11-12 18:20:13,9wghml,30,1,"Hello siblings!

So I got a bit of a backlash in a thread recently when questioning to myself whether I should use ""they is"" or ""they are."" I'm here to make the case for ""they is,"" both from a linguistic and a pride point of view. Obviously in the end do what you want and what feels right for you. I just want to make people think about it. Language is a tool defined by its usage, and there's no ""right"" way to do anything. Also I'm making the case for using the third person singular form of the verb in **all** cases, it just happens that ""is/are"" is more distinct and very common and easy to give clear examples for. 

A bit of background - I'm older than most people on this sub, 38, I teach 2 foreign languages for a living, have taken classes in linguistics (and have studied the topic on my own quite a bit), and am American. The last part is relevant because apparently schools here held onto plural-only they a lot longer than most places. It was beaten into our heads growing up that ""they"" is plural only and to use clunky constructions like ""he or she"" and ""his or hers"" as in ""He or she is going to be very upset when he or she sees his or her grade.""  I still occasionally have trouble parsing in my brain that they is being used for one specific person **despite preferring it myself**. It's happened a couple times specifically on a Gritty FB shitposting group where it will say something like ""they are fighting for the workers"" and I wonder what group ""they"" is referring to until I realize that Gritty is non-binary as well and amazing and wonderful. Anyway that lets you know where I'm coming from and I promise I'm making the point in good faith and am not attacking anyone (as noted above, I prefer ""they"" myself). I'm willing to accept a lot of this may be my personal hangups and existential crisis as someone who doesn't believe in a gender binary yet teaches languages where it's deeply ingrained. At least I've managed to make it a platform to bring up and reinforce the idea of non-binary-ness. 

First of all it's important to point out that yes, singular ""they"" has been in use for hundreds of years, and many of us, myself included, have been quick to point that out to others. However, in the vast majority of the cases it's been used to refer to a **non-specific** subject. The usage of ""they"" to refer to a **singular specific** person has only become common and widely understood and ""accepted"" of late, easily within the last decade (see Abadi, Mark (8 January 2016). ""'They' was just named 2015's Word of the Year"". Business Insider.). I think we should shift usage of the verb to fit the shifted usage of the pronoun. (I also think we need to stop with the ""singular 'they' has been used for hundreds of years!"" argument, as it's really not one made in good faith, frankly). 

""They is"" reinforces the singular, *specific* ""they"". Any other third person singular specific subject in a sentence uses ""is."" To say ""they are"" forces a verb change when the subject's name is replaced with the pronoun, which otherwise doesn't happen in any person. ""Avery is going to the mall."" - &gt; ""They *are* going to the mall"" vs. ""He/She/Ze/Etc. *is* going to the mall."" ""Alex and I are going to the mall. "" - &gt; ""We are going to the mall."" etc. It could be *interpreted* (not by me) as either dehumanizing or demanding to be referred to a way that acts like the ""royal we"" (using plural pronouns and verbs to refer to one's self as royalty does - see Chris Collins, Paul Martin Postal, Imposters: A Study of Pronominal Agreement (2012, ISBN 0262016885)). French has a similar case in the second person, where ""vous"" is historically a plural pronoun now used in the singular formal (a usage started with royalty that trickled down to all formal usage eventually). Using the third person plural form of the verb is simply different from any gendered person, and I think the goal for most of us is for us as individuals and as a group to be seen as ""normal"" with a different little part of us that doesn't define us. 

tl;dr - The part of one's brain that goes ""'they is' just sounds wrong"" is the same part that, for many people, says ""using 'they' for a singular specific person just sounds wrong."" Since we're changing one I think it's right to change the other to match.

I’m an AFAB enby and I wear a 30 i - even if I wasn’t trans, I doubt I’d be pleased with my bust because it’s just so disproportionately large on my small frame it’s comical. I want something small and neutral, like an a or a b cup that could easily just be pecs or some displaced fat on a masc person but also could just be very small tiddies on a femme person. So it’s not the fact that I have breasts that’s an issue, it’s the fact I have huge, unignorable breasts that’s lead many of my past partners to joke about me being an ancient goddess of fertility/femininity/whatever.

My bare chest has always made me violently dysphoric and these days seeing it makes me cry. I also can’t stand how it feels to go braless; I hate the feeling of weight pulling on my chest and the skin hitting that of my stomach. Unfortunately, I don’t have the time or money for top surgery right now. Plus, I have too much breast tissue and not enough other body fat for binders to work for me.

Which would be fine for the time being if every bra in my size wasn’t disgustingly feminine. It’s hard enough just finding a bra in my size at all, much less one that fits and feels right, and at that point, my options are so few I don’t get to be choosy about aesthetics.

271,2018-11-13 05:22:22,9wm6ja,4,1,"Howdy folks. I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my current situation. 

My presentation is all over the place. I was AFAB and some of my secondary sexual characteristics are very noticeable. More often than not people defer to she/her pronouns regardless of how I am presenting. This typically doesn’t particularly bother me and doesn’t cause any dysphoria. It does always cheer me up when folks use he/him or they/them or use more masculine language when referring to me. A few years ago I went by they/them pronouns exclusively. While the people closest to me did attempt to make an adjustment it never really felt genuine and asking for people to stop using she/her almost felt insincere? If that makes sense. It would sometimes feel as if I was asking for something I didn’t fully believe I needed. Nowadays I just roll with she/her but when asked what pronouns I prefer I find myself always hesitating to answer. I don’t have any attachment or connection to she/her but answering “I’m good with whatever” seems dismissive or even a bit snide? The last thing I want to do is treat pronouns as if they are something trivial. 

To further complicate things I recently lost 90 pounds. While I am happy with my weight loss it accentuates parts of my body a lot more than before. I’ve been getting unwanted attention and have felt so much more vulnerable. Before the weight loss I saw my body as something substantial and grounded. I felt strong and more secure in my space and gender identity. Now everything has shifted. I’m trying to rebalance myself and reconnect with my body. My hope is that being able to better articulate my pronoun preference and stop defaulting to she/her for the sake of convenience will help me find that balance/reconnect. 

I want to find a way to communicate I am open to any pronouns and have no attachment to any particular ones while still treating pronouns with respect. Has anyone else experienced something similar? Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated.

I’m a 28 yo AFAB enby who has been working for the same company for about 4.5 years. This company is a large corporate non profit that provides behavioral and mental health care. For the first 2.5-3 years of working there, I presented relatively femme due to societal pressures to conform to female professionalism. Around 1.5 years ago, I cut my hair short, started binding my large chest, and dressing significantly more masculine and androgynous. At this time, I shortened my traditionally feminine name to my nickname which is more androgynous and started asking to be referred to using they/them pronouns. I was honestly very naive in expecting that a non profit specializing in mental health care would be more receptive. There was some performative sort of respect for about two weeks, whereupon everyone then returned to using my female pronouns and name. This is hurtful and disappointing, but I can accept this. 

What I cannot accept however, is the reaction from two men in particular on my team. Both of these cis white males have expressed their “discomfort” and “issues” with the trans community, one of them calling us “unnatural” and the other saying it goes against his religious beliefs. Both of these individuals think they do a good job of separating these personal beliefs from their work and professionalism, however, I’ve experienced some subtle microaggressions from them ever since coming out and I don’t know what to do. Gendered comments, little put downs and scoffs, going out of their way to try to make uncomfortable small talk that is vaguely aggressive with me, complimenting me in gendered ways. One of the individuals followed me out to my car in the parking lot and was speaking to me in a dominating kind of way as I was clearly trying to not have conversation and get in my car to go home. All of these behaviors have been extremely subversive, so I feel like if I were to call them out directly or to a supervisor, I would not have solid ground to stand on and it would just hurt my professional reputation and connections. I feel sexually objectified, vaguely threatened and intimidated, and at the very least quite uncomfortable. I am already avoiding these men as much as possible. I am locked into a contract w my agency and otherwise love my job and work as well, so leaving the agency is not really an option.

310,2018-11-15 00:13:53,9x5txn,1,1,"One thing I keep hearing is that transpeople are (apparently) sometimes overly stereotypical of their chosen gender. This led me to think about how I heard that gender is better defined as a spectrum inside a triangle (hence title, pls don't shoot):  
So let's imagine we have an image of a triangle with a gradient inside: Pink in one corner, which would be female, blue in another corner, which would be male, and white for nonbinary (in this case used as an umbrella term for any gender that would be an extreme different from male and female instead of the actual color gradient of our triangle) in the third corner. As genderfluidity is a thing we'll allow anyone to either mark a specific spot or an entire area.

You'd think cisgender would be on the tip of either male or female, right? What if we put the average cisgender person on about 75% instead of 100% into their corner? That would leave some space for people to be overly male/female. If that just means stereotypically male/female is open for interpretation, but consider that a large amount of the population is rather apathetic towards questioning their gender is such a way to begin with as they simply accept their gender is the one matching their sex as assigned at birth. Meanwhile (just as an example!) a transperson (who is not nonbinary) will initially what to go to their chosen gender's extreme is far as possible - way beyond the average cisperson of that gender - or until reaching a point where they have beaten their dysphoric feelings and can accept their ""new"" spot/area on our theoretical triangle.

Next thing I was thinking about is where to place Agender and if I should at all. You could put them right in the middle because they'd be equally far away from all 3 extremes on our spectrum. But wouldn't they be placed more correctly outside the triangle, leaving a hole in that concept? Now if we consider that there are Agenderfluid people, who's area would be partially inside and partially the outside of the triangle I'm pretty much convinced that I can't describe gender on a 2D plane at all if we want the base to be a simply geometric shape. I wouldn't know where to place myself in what I thought up either.

**TL;DR**: Gender is a spectrum, but too complicated to visually describe based on a simple two-dimensional geometric shape like a triangle, because there are people outside that triangle. The point I wanted to originally make is that the average is not the extreme of their gender because some people are perceived as ""overly male/female"".

**PS**.: Wow this turned into quite a wall of text. I'd just like to clarify that I am merely overthinking an idea I got from reading various opinions online.

328,2018-11-15 18:30:54,9xdu8u,18,1,"Hi r/NonBinary! This is my first post.

I’ve come to realize that I have an extremely difficult time being sexually/romantically/etc attracted to people who aren’t somewhere on the spectrum of gender non-conformity (at least gender-apathetic).

I suppose that, for instance, if a cis man who mostly identifies as straight finds me attractive and wants to date me; I can’t shake the feeling that I’m “basically” a girl in their mind. Lots of people will eventually use the right pronouns/words for me, but I struggle to return their romantic or sexual inclinations even once they’ve started to gender me correctly 100% of the time.

Whereas, one of my partners now, is a bisexual “I don’t really care about gender” AMAB person who understood and gendered me correctly from the start. I think he’s called me “she” once in 5.5 years.

I don’t really know how to approach this realization or how to communicate to people who express interest in me *why* I’m not interested in them. I suppose much of it is my own insecurity, but I sort of feel it is a well-founded one.

I know I don’t want a full tank if I can help it (I have stomach issues that can get worse if I wear tighter clothes around the middle), but my chest is 36DDD and pretty saggy/heavy. From what I’ve read, half tanks aren’t always the best for that chest type. I could do full tank, but I’d have to be careful about when I wear it, which isn’t ideal but it’s better than nothing. Would anyone have any recommendations or experience with a similar body type? Thanks in advance &lt;3', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Binding recommendations for a larger chest?', 'created': 1542377136.0}"

I tend to agree with most of what the man has to say, even if i choose to ignore a large part of it later. but on explaining his thought process breaking down gender he quotes.. It all comes down to one center concept.

FASHION.

So i reflect on that... no.. i dont think so JP.. theres got to be more to gender then that.  BUT.. as I become less and less enamored with my gender, norms, expectations etc in this changing world.. non binary.. is starting to make sense to me. and frankly, for many other reasons, i see why it makes sense to many others.. as well.

So I come to this reddit to glean more information only to discover a subreddit over half full of all you pouges posting pictures of yourselves along with commentary on how you want other people to perceive you or how your looks make you feel.. and all I can think is .. ""seriously"" 'how fucking shallow'.. and also.. 'If i want to go non binary do i have to start dressing like these hacks!!?""

The way people dress or their expectations of others therefore mean very very little to me. and I dont really care how \*I\* look, with the occasional exceptions of going out in public so filthy people could not easily believe I am a brilliant creator and skilled artisan, but also my complete disreguard for personal asthetic represents a level of performance and accomplishment they have no chance of ever achieving. But none of them are paying me.. so I dont really care. Its like bro, I make ten times more then you as a strung out homeless tweaker so give me my change and eye fuck someone else.

When I look at pictures on this sub.. I 'see'... people trying to compensate. over compensate. but,... &gt;&gt;FOR WHAT REASON&lt;&lt;. is it lack of confidence. desire for recognition. trying to separate yourself from your homogeneous group by altering composition? or does compensation have nothing to do with it at all.?

WHY DOES IT MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. &lt;&lt;&lt;please for the love of god.. in expanded paragraph form.. help me with this&lt;&lt;&lt;

IS NON-BINARY.. IS GENDER.. JUST FASHION? and if not.. what else is to this thing..? what do they them.. you.. you   
 people?&gt;? what do you stand for here. fashion breakthrough. or....?????????  I sure hope its the ability to explain things.

\*\*\*

And then as for your identity.. these god damn pronouns. the other solid remaining portion of this sub full of ... wellmy 'whoever' or 'what ever' wont use/respect/aknowledge my prounouns.

what the fuck with these pronouns, and why do you require them. again, lack of self confidence. you feel a need to be respected. force respect.. through acknowledgement..?

&amp;#x200B;

I AM AN OUTLIAR!  ...am I just lucky..? (cursed?)  IVE ALWAYS KNOWN WHO I AM. \*\*IM ME\*\* 

&amp;#x200B;

Call me 'she'. I dont give a fuck. If its not intentionally meant to mock and offend... then its just an honest mistake.. and who cares either way. For some reason... a ton of people have called me 'STEVE' on the job or when I show up to their house. Im horrible with names (thats why these pronouns scare the shit out of me too)If you want to call me Steve.. Im not going to correct you. My name is printed clearly on any correspondence you used to make contact with me. The only time I will correct people is right before theyre about to write me a check. sometimes I just ask to make it out to my brother..

Ive always been me. When I go through hard times: Im the confused Me. An audible noise people make.. does not define my identity. It has no ability to  categorize who and what I am on the etheral plains of existence

so.. wtf with you guys. is everyone here just so... (i keep thinking 'insecure..') so.. at a lack of their own identity.. that this suddenly becomes an impassible issue until solved? or is it because just dressing half queer doesnt take you all the way into new gender territory.

and why do my thoughts or judgement on YOUR LOOKS matter at all..??

I dont believe anyone can be 'right' or 'wrong' as far as this goes. so.. ill assk instead: Am i missing 'it' here? Am I putting myself in my own social disadvantage about not caring about this identity issue? and if i dont care about yours - is that disrespect? (i feel it could be if that is what you held important to yourself, regardless of its value to me)

If i am ME can i ever BECOME ONE OF YOU? if i say or or feel it. yes or no. what makes it so..?

I would hate to feel differently then I do. so i sympathize with anyone who struggles with their own identity. and I want to advocate for it,. and 'you people' (i love saying that). but i dont understand. can you help me?

I wish i could help and just end peoples confusion by being able to say 'dont worry about it. youre you. name, pronoun, gender, completely inconsequential. youre you. b cool. stop trippin."" and that was it. but it doesnt work like that. why..??

361,2018-11-17 22:39:20,9y0qi7,4,1," Hi,

I  once asked on AVEN how non-binary vs. cis vs. trans people dreamed and  what their bodies look like in their dreams and there seems to be some  differences, I'm curious about you guys. I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.

I   only learnt relatively recently that most people don't know they are   dreaming during their dreams but I always do and always have. It's not   the same as a lucid dream because I've had those, they are regular dreams but I can control my actions and the environment to a degree.

I   also dream of myself in 3rd person (I see my body in 3rd person like I   am watching myself in a movie). Occasionally I swap between 1st and  3rd  person at will.

Here are some questions, I will reply to them below:

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have ""super powers"" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once ""possessed"" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual. Possibly non-binary. Idk, still figuring myself out.

394,2018-11-19 08:16:44,9yevhg,14,1,"Hi all! I'm new here, and I'm hoping to find some perspective on pronouns and see if anyone feels the way I do. 

I hate that people use any pronouns to refer to me. I strongly prefer my name be used instead of a pronoun if possible, but that's a big ask. Here's why pronouns bother me so much. 

If someone uses ""she"" or ""he"":
Ugh, instant dysphoria. That's *wrong*. Just *viscerally wrong*. I'm *not that thing*. Great now I'm thinking about how and why that person thinks of me as being that gender, and falling down a dysphoric rabbit hole. Plz no. 

If someone uses ""they"":
Oh god I feel so guilty and self centered for asking for that. Did I ask for that? Did they just assume? Oh fuck what *is* this person's model of my gender? Do they think I want to be a they? Do they think I have a gender? Fuck, dysphoria. ""They"" as a pronoun Means Things now and isn't just a null value. Plz. Plz no. 

There's no right answer. I don't in any way begrudge anyone else their gender identity. I just wish it wasn't such a dominant paradigm that people expect *me* to have one. I **don't**. 

At some point I was asking people to use ""they,"" but I'm not sure any more. I never had a preference for it so much as a dispreference for being thought of as gendered in any capacity. I want to be able to just opt out of gender. To leave that field blank. I thought ""they"" would be a good null entry. 

But then I got more involved in the nb scene and found that many enbies *identify with* ""they."" This is great for them. They've found an option that works for them. I don't begrudge it at all. But it does make ""they"" no longer work for me. Because now it's an Identity too, which is what I was trying to avoid. The issue isn't with enbies identifying with ""they,"" it's that we don't actually have a null value pronoun. 

The thing that's causing the dysphoria isn't that the pronoun is wrong; they're all wrong. It's that it reminds me that this person, and all the other people I meet, have gendered models of me in their heads. To them, I'm *(insert gender here)* and that will always be wrong. I ultimately don't have much control over it, just like I don't have much control over my secondary sex characteristics, and that's horrifying to realize every time.

While this post deals mainly with issues of trans masculine nonbinary dysphoria, of course trans feminine and binary people offering support or ideas is more than welcome.


I'd also like to apologize in advance if I don't make much sense. I hav lots of trouble describing particular aspects of my dysphoria so I use metaphors a lot. I'm also really really struggling. 


~ ~ ~ ~ ~  ~


Ok so I'm here today because I'm really struggling with dysphoria and depression. So my situation is I am an afab genderfluid person with severe fluctuating dysphoria.


I'm just gonna describe my dysphoria a bit before moving on. So some days I am fine with no dysphoria, other days I have intense dysphoria and still some days I fall in between. Generally my dysphoria switches in larger.... Chunks of time? It's not a daily thing but more biweekly maybe, and it tends to be like an underlying dysphoria with really bad spurts. Think of like a low humming sound that sometimes increases in volume momentarily. I get dysphoria about everything from my chest to my jawline. I have ""phantom dick"" syndrome. I also get this really weird feeling when dysphoria suddenly intensifies.... It's like something inside of me is bursting through my core? Like imagine a spirit leaving your body (without the death). It feels like how one may imagine that would feel. Not corporal, but still there.  Sometimes my dysphoria leaves me nauseous, etc etc.



You may be saying well it sounds like testosterone is for you! However as a genderfluid person I am putting emphasis on dysphoric *fluctuations*. It follows that if I were to go on t, I'd have girl days still, and would therefore have a sort of reverse dysphoria. That's one issue with that. This leads into the next issue, which is of course I am still feminine as well so being on t and dressing and appearing feminine may be dangerous in some situations and I am afraid of being harmed.


This leads into my issues surrounding hate and bigotry. People barely get binary trans people, not to mention us nonbinary folks. Transphobia in general hurts and scares me. Then there is the nonbinary specific Transphobia which I have to deal with as well, from both within and outside of the trans community. The hate is present and seems to be growing. It's taking a big toll on me. I'm technically out, but I'm scared of being visible in any way. Right now I appear like a masculine girl I suppose, so I haven't had to say much about my gender outside of my small social circle. All of this, the dysphoria and the hate, has led me to despair


I will never be able to live my truth. Hatred is everywhere. Dysphoria is atypical and I can't deal with it anymore. I am tired of being viewed as a joke and I'm tired of feeling I will never be free of dysphoria. I am worried. I have found over the last two years that I'm experiencing something that may be some kind of dissociation : periodically it feels as if I am not in the physical world, that nothing is real. It randomly feels like my clothes go missing so I have to touch my legs to make sure my pants are still there. Sounds silly but it is very distressing. Sometimes i can't feel the ground, it's like I'm on clouds. I'm not sure if this is related to my dysphoria and depression but it may be. I feel like i am going crazy.


Yes I am on the waiting list to see therapists. It is just a waiting game now


So I'm asking for advice. Particularly from trans masculine people in similar situations, though all support helps. Also please hold off the hate comments and PM's. I had someone from here message me telling me to kill myself for being nonbinary. That didn't help at all.


Has anyone else experienced anything like this?


How do I deal with the hate?


How can I deal with dysphoria in non medical ways?


I'm becoming filled with despair and having many thoughts of just ending it all

compliments all night from a cis woman in the group until she   
reads me on my voice.  Crushed and needs some kind words.  


I count myself very fortunate to have a small circle of trans friends who I can periodically meet up with for dinner and drinks, share some laughs and good conversation.  As a closeted person, it helps my mental state to get out and be with other transfolk even if it's just every now and again.

So this last time, there was a new girl-like-us who attended and she brought her wife, a cis woman, who was really fun to be around. God she was sooo much fun!  Very accepting, curious and inquisitive... in a respectful way and even became comfortable enough to playfully poke fun and joke with us.

Throughout the evening she gave me a number of compliments and coming from a cis girl, it just meant soooo much UNTIL....

&amp;#x200B;

the last one she gave after a couple of glasses of wine.  She kind of rolled up all her compliments in one breath... you know, saying how she really liked my outfit, it showed off my figure really well, my makeup looked good as did my hair and then...

""I mean you just look so....   just so nice and cute.  And except for your voice, which *totally*  gives it away, you pass pretty well. ""

God, I thought I was going to cry.  I mean like lower lip quivering, heaving-chest, mascara blurring, heavy tears right then and there.  It was all I could do to keep from crying.  Ugh...

I mean I KNOW my voice isn't great and I KNOW  because of my broad shoulders and facial structure I get read as a boy dressing as a girl but after getting all those nice compliments from her throughout the night and then to hear her say that...

&amp;#x200B;

it just really hurt. :(     I mean, I know I don't necessarily pass but can you all just... I don't know, tell me I look pretty and make me feel better.  Feeling really down still.  This is a pic from that night after I left for the evening.

434,2018-11-20 21:46:21,9ywq76,0,1,"Hi all, kind of just looking to get some perspective/advice.

I’m an AFAB and I’ve identified as a woman my whole life pretty much without question.  I recently came out to my family and some of my friends as bisexual. It’s been really great, I feel like I can finally be myself and coming out to them was definitely worth the initial anxiety over what might happen. 

Interestingly, one of the things I’ve felt has been the most freeing about coming out has been this feeling that I don’t have to conform to being a traditionally feminine woman anymore, I cut my long hair down to a short bob and I’ve been wearing more masculine or androgynous clothing and I feel really amazing doing so.  I went to conservative catholic schools all through K-12, and my parents would pressure me to dress “more feminine” when I wore things like Doc Martens and t-shirts, and I subsequently went through several hyper-feminine phases but I never really felt totally comfortable wearing things like short girly dresses, but I always thought it was because I wasn’t “finding the right color” or “finding the right fit for my body type”, etc rather than thinking maybe I just wasn’t comfortable dressing that way altogether.  

The fact allowing myself to deviate from traditionally female expectations has felt so good has made me question whether I was repressing a desire to do this for some time, and maybe whether this could be indicative of perhaps being somewhere in the realm of non-binary?  When I started thinking this, sometimes I feel like maybe I fit somewhere in between non-binary and being a woman.  Pretty much for the first time ever (I normally really like my T&amp;A lol) I was wearing a baggy shirt and kind of felt like I wanted smaller boobs or just flatness.  Lately I feel like I sometimes want to bounce back between non-binary and woman, but I’ve never felt this way before or questioned my gender prior to coming out, so it makes me feel more confused.  I’m not sure if it’s just because it’s the first time in my life I’ve dressed not traditionally feminine or if maybe I really do feel like I could have a different gender identity other than just woman. 

I know that gender expression is different than gender identity, but I’ve been wondering if maybe it isn’t so much the new clothes that feel great, but maybe wearing things that align more with how i might identify internally, but I start to get really confused when I think too much about it though because I think then we’ll gender is a social construct and there’s nothing inherently in our biology that dictates what clothes we should wear...etc. 

I guess I’m very early on this journey of figuring out what’s going on inside and learning more about myself, and I’m just wondering did anyone have similar experiences?  Is there a word for this feeling?  What did you learn as a result of your soul-searching?  Is it normal to not at all question your gender identity until learning what non-binary was?

436,2018-11-20 22:00:35,9ywusu,4,1,"Rant time, bear with me. 

So I'm starting out on my social/non-medical transition and it's been rocky. 

I've always identified as being ambivalent towards gender. I just didn't care about what was for boys and what was for girls, I did what I wanted. That said, I've always presented very feminine and prefer to wear skirts (pants are evil). My main beef with my AFAB has always been 1. My uterus, i hate that thing so much 2. That my genitalia should determine how I act and feel. 

For the most part, I am comfortable with my sex (the physical characteristics) but my gender does not line up with that sex. I mostly blame a binaty culture for this. If I could be a female sexed person in an androgynous role within society (that everyone accepted and understood that my physical characteristics did not determine my internal gender), that would be my dream.

Now that I' taking steps to look more androgynous, I sat down with my husband to revisit my gender. We've been talking about it regularly to make sure we're on the same page. After talking through the above info he mentioned that he would support me through this but would always see me as a girl who wasn't a ""girl"". 

I honestly just don't know how to feel. Part of me is worried that I really am a girl playing at being agender. Another part of me wishes I was a sexless genderless being so I didn't have to deal with thia crap. The final part is worried that when I get where I'm going I'll realise all of this is a mistake and that I was being a fake all along.

438,2018-11-21 02:54:21,9yz7cl,2,1,"Sorry this one got a bit long but it’s been really weighing on my mind 

I’m maybe questioning and I wanted to compare to see if anyone else has had similar experiences? 

Recently my partner came out as nonbinary and transmasculine and my sudden weight gain from birth control around my boobs and hips has stirred up something in me that I’m not sure is real or not.

I feel conflicted in any desire to think about or explore a nonbinary identity because my mind always circles round to “What makes your feelings and experiences different than any other woman? When I think things like “well I don’t enjoy womanhood” or “it’s hard for me to feel like and relate to depictions of women in media”, it makes a little voice in my head say, do you really think that all dis and trans women have a mystical innate enjoyment of everything that goes along with being a girl? 

I don’t know if it’s possible to separate my gender feelings from misogyny feelings. I don’t know if sometimes existing in the way I do is uncomfortable because existing as a woman in current day society fucking sucks or I’m you know, perhaps not as much of a girl as I thought. 

Like there’s nothing that really defines being a woman and it can mean so many things to different people from different cultures and places so like my shtick might just be a part of that - stuff like hating shaving body hair, long hair, tight gauzy clothing, bras that show and cling to the shape of my new and dreadful D cups, like that is all stuff that a woman could also dislike.

I would also feel a lot of guilt if I stopped IDing as a woman because I’ve spent my whole life fighting to prove that women can be crush it in a STEM major, can crush it in comedy and don’t have to be feminine. I was happy identifying as a butch lesbian for the longest time because I thought it spoke to my experiences of alienation from my straight peers and what society expects women to act like and be. But my partner no longer identifies as a woman so it seems I doesn’t really fit the description anymore. Before them, I had boyfriend who was straight but I don’t know if I wasn’t really feeling our relationship because I dislike guys or because I dislike the idea of being a guy’s girlfriend and being treated as such. I love my partner no matter what, so it’s no big deal. But I don’t know what my own sexuality is apart from probably not cis men.

It’s complicated to me because I feel that if I said I was NB, I’d just be copying them to deal with the fact I can’t in good faith call myself a lesbian anymore. It feels somehow facetious to me to be like “Oh yes I am nonbinary, because I don’t fit extreme and ridiculous gender stereotypes about women but I will never tell that to other people because I am deeply scared.” I’d feel like such a faker and a phoney to compare my experiences to that of other members of the trans community I know who have had such a hard time in their inner and professional lives due to actual transphobia. I’ve been bullied for being not living up to expectations of women in my adult life, but I had a girlhood and teenhood that was pretty unscathed apart from internalized homophobia because I was so repressed that no-one, not even me, knew I was gay. And like I - did - have a childhood of a girl that was really impacted by sexism but also by growing up as a girl, so take that as you will. 

I keep having these thoughts that I wouldn’t judge anyone else by but for myself I’m like: 

The medical, social, and governmental hoops would make your personal and professional lives hell, so you’re better off staying where you are. You have no idea if this will make it better. 

People go to great extremes to be seen as their real, internal gender so if you are this hesitant about it, it probably isn’t real.

You are an extremely timid person who bursts into tears easily, if the world perceived you as a man other people would absolutely not tolerate you - you would be destroyed. 

My parents are already extremely unsupportive of me being gay, and I know they won’t “get it” Or respect me if I say I’m gender neutral. If I ever pursued biomedical transition (which I’m not sure if I want or not) they will flip out and have a extreme transphobia heart attack. As silly as it is, I love my parents deeply and look to their guidance and often their financial support and I don’t want to lose them when they’ve sacrificed so much for me. My extended family will not be supportive either.  I would just feel like an idiot if I said I was nonbinary but continued receive the benefits of being a tall, presumably cis, somewhat skinny white woman for my entire life. Like am I just feeling this way because I think I can get away with calling myself nonbinary because I am skinny and white and AFAB and that’s like the stereotype/poster child?

My now ever present boobs make me miserable and my weight gain makes me upset, and I feel like I wouldn’t mind being referred to by “they” and the gender neutral spelling of my current name and having a full breast reduction if I could pay for it and not let my parents know but I don’t really mind if strangers call me she as they don’t know better. It makes me more anxious when my fellow LGBT people seemingly put all these assumptions of me being a hundred percent a girl and not having complicated gender feelings of my own.

I’m not really looking for a definite answer saying that I’m valid but wanted to see if anyone ever felt similarly? If there’s any part of this that you’ve ever felt? It’s hard for me to understand any of my own internal thoughts because my childhood has taught me that the only things that are real are like, externally validated through the opinions of others - as horrible as this is, I’m still struggling with it.

You have no idea if this will make it better. \n\nPeople go to great extremes to be seen as their real, internal gender so if you are this hesitant about it, it probably isn’t real.\n\nYou are an extremely timid person who bursts into tears easily, if the world perceived you as a man other people would absolutely not tolerate you - you would be destroyed. \n\nMy parents are already extremely unsupportive of me being gay, and I know they won’t “get it” Or respect me if I say I’m gender neutral. If I ever pursued biomedical transition (which I’m not sure if I want or not) they will flip out and have a extreme transphobia heart attack. As silly as it is, I love my parents deeply and look to their guidance and often their financial support and I don’t want to lose them when they’ve sacrificed so much for me. My extended family will not be supportive either.  I would just feel like an idiot if I said I was nonbinary but continued receive the benefits of being a tall, presumably cis, somewhat skinny white woman for my entire life. Like am I just feeling this way because I think I can get away with calling myself nonbinary because I am skinny and white and AFAB and that’s like the stereotype/poster child?\n\nMy now ever present boobs make me miserable and my weight gain makes me upset, and I feel like I wouldn’t mind being referred to by “they” and the gender neutral spelling of my current name and having a full breast reduction if I could pay for it and not let my parents know but I don’t really mind if strangers call me she as they don’t know better. It makes me more anxious when my fellow LGBT people seemingly put all these assumptions of me being a hundred percent a girl and not having complicated gender feelings of my own.\n\nI’m not really looking for a definite answer saying that I’m valid but wanted to see if anyone ever felt similarly? If there’s any part of this that you’ve ever felt? It’s hard for me to understand any of my own internal thoughts because my childhood has taught me that the only things that are real are like, externally validated through the opinions of others - as horrible as this is, I’m still struggling with it.\n\nEither way thank you for your time ', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Having an awful time questioning and wondering if anyone else shared my experiences', 'created': 1542794061.0}"

My issue is that I now feel super guilty because I've hardly worn it.

489,2018-11-24 05:59:14,9zw20i,1,1,"These are phrases said by my mother that run through my brain every time I feel distressed about being closeted and could possibly open up to her. Perhaps I should give a dysphoria warning? &lt;—- Here that is. 

“If someone is lgbtq they were born that way and we would know from an early age.” I’ve never felt like I could identify with any gender. From a young age, I would seek friends of “both genders” because it fulfilled what I felt I was comfortable with socially. As I got older, the usual things would be said about hanging out with “girls” and hanging out with “boys”. Especially to other kids at school, these things were assumed. Me being branded as a girl, if I hung out with the girls, I was just one of them and we did “girly” things and were told “you ____ like a girl”. If I hung out with the boys, I was probably doing something sneaky and bad with them or looking for attention. I never understood why I was being pulled this and that way, expected to act “like a girl”. Yes, I am physically female, but how should this dictate my social upbringing and the expectation of my achievments? I had a very delicate view of myself because I was so impressionable, and so many people were trying to tell me what I should be like, even if it wasn’t directly being said to me. Until I got to college and finally realized that gender really means nothing but what your body form is, I was molded into a scared being that made a lot of mistakes and made decisions in other peoples’ interests. 

I felt empathy for almost everyone I had ever talked to, and wanted to do everything I could to care for them. However, because I “was a girl/woman”, it showed to others that I could be looking for attention or was trying to go against how I was taught to act, or was giving too much of myself away. If I was a boy, I might not have been targeted by others as emotional or physical relief and therefore not extruded as someone with weak will. 

“You’re still a girl, right?” Once you started to realize I sympathized with lgbtq+ people and culture, you started to ask me things like this. It felt to me like you were trying to affirm that the way you viewed me was true. That if I had any ounce of thought in my brain that I may be lgbtq, I would tell you then. I didn’t feel safe. I didn’t tell you. This is a phrase that pops up in my mind almost every day. Whenever you talk to me about lgbtq+ issues and say how you feel about the invalidation of these people, I remember you saying this. You were showing me a closed door, and all I was prepared to do was walk past it and deny that I identified as anything other than female. Almost every time you see me, you talk to me about the latest lgbtq+ issue in the news or about your friends at work and how they deal with lgbtq+ topics. I’m sure it would be no problem now if I told you how I identified, but I am so afraid of these things that you have said to me that I can’t bring myself to talk to you about it. I feel like Nitinol, and any lgbtq+ related conversation with you is the heat. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? I am so scared. 

“Your boyfriend would be uncomfortable if you were lgbtq+, right, because he is a straight man?” You have said this to me when you were against lgbtq+ people, as well as when you began to be sympathetic to lgbtq+ issues and people. My identity is one thing and conversation that our relationship improves on every day, and he has assured me every time that he loves me no matter my identity. My identity is something that deals with my mental wellbeing and this is something especially important in relationships. He recognizes this and we grow more supportive of eachother every day because I am warming up and opening up to him more and more about it. I am getting stronger emotionally because we are able to have these conversations. 

“I raised my daughters with good hygiene, and for them to shave their legs and armpits.” Humans naturally grow hair. I would much rather be in a practice room practicing early before a class or going out to get coffee or see friends instead of using the time to complete an unnecessary task that does not matter to me. Having hairy legs is something I do not care about. Having hairy armpits is something that I do not care about. There are more and more important woman on red carpets with unshaven armpits and legs, and the only people that make big deals about it are making money off of it. I take care of myself, and have great hygiene. Hair removal has nothing to do with hygiene, and sometimes even has a negative effect on hygiene. My anxiety skyrockets every time I come home for a vacation and I have to make time for something that makes me emotionally sick and anxious because of how I have been treated in regard to when I don’t remove it. 

Since my best friends are nonbinary as well - “You always want to do what your friends are doing, so I can’t believe you.” Have you ever experienced something, and then realized that everything happening up until then makes sense because of it? Once I moved away from home and made friends with so many new people and heard so many more views of the world, discussions about gender identity stood out to me. It’s not sexuality, which can be defined by sexual attraction, it is how someone sees themself and believes others should see them in their fullest confidence. This stood out to me because it is one of the first things I have to think of for myself. I can talk about it with other people, but ultimately I have to decide what makes me feel happy and what makes me feel like my truest self. When I get rid of gender expectations and presumptions and assumptions, I see a whole new world where I can be who I want to be and thrive without all these things swirling around in my head, worrying me. 

“You don’t present very femininely but you still identify as a woman, right?” You saying this, and pointing out the parallel of how you present yourself, were not the best ways of trying to clarify, if that is what you were trying to do. Even though you now say every day that you would love your children no matter their identity/sexuality, I am so afraid to try to get through to you about myself because of all these fears cramming my thoughts. When I want to look at the “men’s” clothing section of Goodwill or any store, I don’t care that the clothes are designed for “men”. I want to wear things I am happy to wear and look like Me. I just want to look like Me. 

All these times, in order that I remember them going on in my life, I didn’t feel I could really say what I felt or even put together what I really wanted to say to you. I don’t hold anything against you and love you no matter what. I am just stuck with these words in my mind and I am afraid. 

There is no reason that the world should be driven by gender or anything that has to do with someone’s reproductive capabilities or bodily makeup. I personally can’t thrive any longer in an environment where I am confined by my own mind and what other people believe I should look or act like. Isn’t experiencing life to its fullest what it means to be human? I can’t keep the face on anymore, but I also can’t tell you, Mom, how I truly feel.

However, because I “was a girl/woman”, it showed to others that I could be looking for attention or was trying to go against how I was taught to act, or was giving too much of myself away. If I was a boy, I might not have been targeted by others as emotional or physical relief and therefore not extruded as someone with weak will. \n\n“You’re still a girl, right?” Once you started to realize I sympathized with lgbtq+ people and culture, you started to ask me things like this. It felt to me like you were trying to affirm that the way you viewed me was true. That if I had any ounce of thought in my brain that I may be lgbtq, I would tell you then. I didn’t feel safe. I didn’t tell you. This is a phrase that pops up in my mind almost every day. Whenever you talk to me about lgbtq+ issues and say how you feel about the invalidation of these people, I remember you saying this. You were showing me a closed door, and all I was prepared to do was walk past it and deny that I identified as anything other than female. Almost every time you see me, you talk to me about the latest lgbtq+ issue in the news or about your friends at work and how they deal with lgbtq+ topics. I’m sure it would be no problem now if I told you how I identified, but I am so afraid of these things that you have said to me that I can’t bring myself to talk to you about it. I feel like Nitinol, and any lgbtq+ related conversation with you is the heat. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? I am so scared. \n\n“Your boyfriend would be uncomfortable if you were lgbtq+, right, because he is a straight man?” You have said this to me when you were against lgbtq+ people, as well as when you began to be sympathetic to lgbtq+ issues and people. My identity is one thing and conversation that our relationship improves on every day, and he has assured me every time that he loves me no matter my identity. My identity is something that deals with my mental wellbeing and this is something especially important in relationships. He recognizes this and we grow more supportive of eachother every day because I am warming up and opening up to him more and more about it. I am getting stronger emotionally because we are able to have these conversations. \n\n“I raised my daughters with good hygiene, and for them to shave their legs and armpits.” Humans naturally grow hair. I would much rather be in a practice room practicing early before a class or going out to get coffee or see friends instead of using the time to complete an unnecessary task that does not matter to me. Having hairy legs is something I do not care about. Having hairy armpits is something that I do not care about. There are more and more important woman on red carpets with unshaven armpits and legs, and the only people that make big deals about it are making money off of it. I take care of myself, and have great hygiene. Hair removal has nothing to do with hygiene, and sometimes even has a negative effect on hygiene. My anxiety skyrockets every time I come home for a vacation and I have to make time for something that makes me emotionally sick and anxious because of how I have been treated in regard to when I don’t remove it. \n\nSince my best friends are nonbinary as well - “You always want to do what your friends are doing, so I can’t believe you.” Have you ever experienced something, and then realized that everything happening up until then makes sense because of it? Once I moved away from home and made friends with so many new people and heard so many more views of the world, discussions about gender identity stood out to me. It’s not sexuality, which can be defined by sexual attraction, it is how someone sees themself and believes others should see them in their fullest confidence. This stood out to me because it is one of the first things I have to think of for myself. I can talk about it with other people, but ultimately I have to decide what makes me feel happy and what makes me feel like my truest self. When I get rid of gender expectations and presumptions and assumptions, I see a whole new world where I can be who I want to be and thrive without all these things swirling around in my head, worrying me. \n\n“You don’t present very femininely but you still identify as a woman, right?” You saying this, and pointing out the parallel of how you present yourself, were not the best ways of trying to clarify, if that is what you were trying to do. Even though you now say every day that you would love your children no matter their identity/sexuality, I am so afraid to try to get through to you about myself because of all these fears cramming my thoughts. When I want to look at the “men’s” clothing section of Goodwill or any store, I don’t care that the clothes are designed for “men”. I want to wear things I am happy to wear and look like Me. I just want to look like Me. \n\nAll these times, in order that I remember them going on in my life, I didn’t feel I could really say what I felt or even put together what I really wanted to say to you. I don’t hold anything against you and love you no matter what. I am just stuck with these words in my mind and I am afraid. \n\nThere is no reason that the world should be driven by gender or anything that has to do with someone’s reproductive capabilities or bodily makeup. I personally can’t thrive any longer in an environment where I am confined by my own mind and what other people believe I should look or act like. Isn’t experiencing life to its fullest what it means to be human? I can’t keep the face on anymore, but I also can’t tell you, Mom, how I truly feel.

But my breasticles are soo big. The dysphoria I feel surrounding them is killing me.
With the tape my chest was relatively flat. Flatter than I've seen it since childhood. It looked amazing and I felt so good. But it also made me much more aware of them since I felt them squeezed so tightly.
It was difficult breathing, which wasn't too bad. But it also pinched and stung.
I swear I used half of a 10 meter roll.
I'm seriously considering using bandages now, which everyone suggests against. But the tape can get expensive.

I  wanted to do a survey to get the community involved, and get their input on what they would like to see. This is an extremely quick survey  with no required questions. Every single response helps!

This community truly is the greatest, and I want to work on something that will give back to the trans community as a whole. I hope once I graduate, I can begin to work on this website as a pet project, and give the community a truly comprehensive and easy to understand site that they can use for themselves and to help others.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdN2Df-DeYybj6ZYpGJ2hiHyxoCLvsQZGP9NfXUe593m86HqA/viewform?usp=sf_link) is the survey!

Some background: I'm afab and grew up in an evangelical community where being anything other than straight and cis didn't seem like an option. After I moved to a very progressive university in a diverse city, I came out as a lesbian, cut my hair short, started attending an affirming church, and began to address some of my mental health issues. For the first time, I felt more comfortable dressing and interacting with the world in a very femme way. Suddenly, it felt like I was subverting traditional gender roles by expressing myself that way, and I really liked that feeling. However, something still feels off. When I'm with my girlfriend or close friends, I generally feel okay with my gender expression, but when I'm in public, I'm acutely aware of how my femme presentation and naturally curvy figure read to everyone else. I've tried dressing in a more androgynous way, but that doesn't feel right, either. I am very uncomfortable with my bust and hips, but I have a hard time teasing out how much of that is dysphoria as opposed to the typical body image issues most binary women face. Further, identifying as a man, or even something between a man and a woman, feels viscerally wrong.

But honestly E might still be on the table.

&amp;#x200B;

Since discovering there was something you might call a ""third option"" (however inaccurately), I've wondered if there might be small changes I can make to my presentation/performance—so that it lines up a bit more with the deep ambiguity/ambivalence I feel toward gender in general, and the mild-to-moderate distaste I feel for masculinity in particular.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it may seem like a small thing, but I think it would be really fun to get a septum piercing. It's way out of my historical comfort zone, but that would be sort of the point. I've always been really shy about this stuff, but kinda tired of being in the closet. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I made a faux nose ring with a bit of wire, just to see what it would look like. I also ordered an actual faux nose ring for a couple bucks, but it won't be here for a week or more, and I'm getting antsy. Without further ado...

531,2018-11-26 02:11:26,a0ezt0,6,1,"Hey everybody.
I'm afab and agender.
Been on T for just over a year now.

The longer I'm on T though, the more I start to get dysphoric from the changes.
I know I'm not cis, and I've known that since childhood, but it almost seems like my dysphoria is incurable and I don't know what to do.

I started T mostly with the intention of changing my voice, and maybe getting some face/body changes. So far, I've had one VERY minor voice drop and nothing else as far as any of those changes go. 
I knew to expect other changes though, and that I couldn't pick and choose them. Even so, I was willing to deal with things I didn't want to deal with severe voice dysphoria. I was always fairly hairy pre-T, and very content with the amount of body hair I had. I had a MAJOR increase in growth almost immediately, and after awhile, I had so much hair that it caused dysphoria, but if I shaved, I also got dysphoria. There's a brief window of time between shaving and full growth where I'm comfortable though. Facial hair? Started growing it by about 2 1/2 months, and usually have to shave daily now. Hate it. Huge source of- you guessed it, dysphoria. I was neutral on bottom growth until about 8 or 9 months in, and out of nowhere, I started hating it too. I'd be willing to accept all of these things if my voice would actually fucking change, but it won't. My T levels are comfortably in the male ranges but not too high, and have been since very early on, not to mention I believe I was told in the past that I have naturally high testosterone levelz for someone afab. It really seems like the only positive thing I got out of this whole mess was the end to my monthly cycle (I had one maybe 3 or 4 days after I started T, and that was the last one Ive had). Im desperate for my voice to change but everything else is making me miserable. I'm debating stopping in 6 months at my next appointment, but I really don't know what to do. I look and sound exactly like a somewhat hairier, acne covered version of my pre-T self and it's incredibly discouraging. 

Another issues is my chest and bottom dysphoria. I'm so poor and my efforts at crowdfunding have been pathetic, so I don't see myself reasonanly affording top surgery for another 3-5 years. My family is poor too, so there's no chance of someone else paying for it. 
My bottom dysphoria is a confusing and complicated beast on it's own. I absolutely cannot stand my natal junk, but the idea of having a dick is only slightly better. Both cause me massive amounts of dysphoria. Honestly of metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, phallo is the one that I'd be most comfortable with, but even it just feels so wrong to me. I'm never going to be happy unless I quite literally have no genitals, and I'm not entirely sure that's possible right now, or ever in my lifetime.

I'm afab and I have very long hair, like down to my waist. I have had both long and short hair and everything in between throughout my life. When I was little, my mom mostly kept it short and out of the way; I didn't care because I was a kid and considered myself a tomboy and stuff. I was 11 when I started caring and decided to grow it out. It was pretty long by the time I was 14, and decided I wanted to try something new and cut it very short. I remember immediately hating it and literally crying out of regret. I didn't cut it again til I was 18 and it was once again really long. 

This time, I cut it short more out of pressure to prove to my gf-at-the-time that I wasn't gonna be her perfect ""femme"" (long story). I was young and confused and actually at the start of questioning myself gender-wise. I think I remember having some regret but it must have not hit me as hard because after breaking up with the gf, I did let my hair grow some, but I also kept playing around with hair dye and ""scene"" hairstyles so I wasn't that invested in getting it long again. 

About a year after that, I was 20, I started learning about non-binary identities and started id'ing as such. I tried a few different short styles and was ok with them but it seemed like I could never achieve the androgynous look or styles I was going for. 

Eventually I did start wanting long hair again though. This was actually one of the things that caused me to stop id'ing as non-binary, I thought wanting long hair as an afab person meant I couldn't be valid as non-binary. People would always see me as a regular cis girl with long hair so why bother saying I'm anything else? 

I started letting my hair grow. I tucked away that part of me that felt like I could be nb (though my hair choices were certainly not the singular reason for this, there were others). That was a few years ago. My hair is now very long! I've been so happy about it... until now. 

I find myself feeling once again like I can't be valid as an afab nb person if I keep my hair this long. At first I was thinking that, who cares what anyone thinks, I'll keep my hair long if I want? But now I'm feeling the pressure again.. I don't think that's it either. Part of me does like short hair too and kinda misses it. I'm fond of certain ""a-line"" haircuts and I do think I looked kinda cute with certain short styles. But... I feel stuck because I also love my long hair and the thought of cutting it actually really scares me. I'm afraid of feeling immediate regret again and it taking another 3+ years to get it back. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm thinking I should probably not do anything hasty and just leave my hair alone unless these feelings continue for 6+ months. It's just hard because as much as I love my long hair, I'm kinda resenting it right now because I need to feel validated. I'm also still kinda figuring this stuff out. I think I'm probably genderfluid and would actually love to present as a boy at times but how do I do that with my hair being this long? Do I just get a short wig? Or maybe cutting my hair short and getting some long wigs would be the better way to go. I'm not sure. I still want to be seen as a valid nb person even with long hair...

I'm white, and I identify with being nonbinary. I don't identify as a man or a woman, but I also don't feel like I am lacking gender.

In recent years I began crossdressing (MtF) and that satisfied me for quite some time, and for a while I viewed myself as a male who simply had a crossdressing kink.

Now, however, I'm not so sure.  I'm turning 30 in a few months.  I would love to live at least into my 90s, and I've been thinking about my remaining time on this planet, and for me, time has been moving at an accelerated pace.  I'm thinking about what I want to do/accomplish/feel, and I realize that I really like being feminine and how I interact with people when I present as femme.  I don't consider myself a woman or transwoman, but I feel that ""male"" simply isn't an accurate representation of my being.  I don't hate my penis or other masculine features, but it's just ""meh"" to me - nothing exciting or interesting about it, and I wouldn't miss them if they were gone.  With this in mind, expressing myself exclusively as a male moving forward will be a case of me not being true to myself - being male is just what biology gave me in terms of anatomy, and my mind and soul can't really be categorized.  So that brings me to this space - we're only here on this planet once, and I'm feeling a more and more pressing urge to express who I truly am and want to be.

There's a select crowd of people in my life who know, but it's an isolated group - most, including my family, don't know.  I kind of want to come out at a slow pace, ease into it, slowly meet other NB people, but not make a big coming out ceremony just yet.  I still need to figure out if this is me, though from everything I'm seeing this is the best fit.  I do sometimes worry though because I've seen some non-binary people get made fun of or called ""special snowflakes"" or other mean names (especially in the more toxic parts of the Internet), but I've met a lot of NB people and I never thought they were doing it for attention - they are truly being themselves.  

This is a bit of a rant, but have to get it off my chest.  This has taken literally years to figure out but I'm finally glad things are starting to make a bit more sense in my head.

Could this be some internalized fear of me truly being trans but not accepting it?  I feel hella lost.

&amp;#x200B;

The other day, my office had a trans-nonbinary person come in for a workplace sensitivity training type thing. Which was honestly pretty awesome and I'm glad they did. But one of the first exercise they did was go around the room and ask for people's pronouns. Immediately, I started panicking at the thought of having to identify my pronouns.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically at this point in my life, I don't know if I'm cis. I might end up being so, but I'm not comfortable labelling myself as such right now. I'm AFAB, almost always presented as femme-ish at work and in my social life, and it's more likely than not people will assume I'm a cis female. However, I've never been comfortable with... I guess, straight up labelling myself as female in front of others. It feels like I'm shutting out parts of me that I don't really know how to identify right now. I have usually worn feminine clothes, mostly because of size and availability (I'm 4'11 and tiny). I have no problem with people referring to me as she / her. But at the same time, during my teen years all I wore were boy's clothes, since it was an option before breasts and butts were a thing. I didn't mind it when people who didn't know me referred to me as he / him during that point in my life. I want a penis sometimes, but I also want to be able to keep my vagina / boobs (Think Ranma 1/2 if you're familiar with anime).

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, I really don't have a preference for what pronouns people use for me. It makes me a little happy when people accidentally refer to me as ""he/him"" or ""they/them"", mostly because I feel like a neglected part of me is getting recognized. But I don't feel dysphoric when people assume I'm female either. I'm not trying to be dismissive, but I just... don't care for gender.

&amp;#x200B;

But during this presentation, the thought of having to identify myself with a pronoun in front of my co-workers nearly gave me a full blown panic attack. Thankfully they didn't get to me and moved on with the presentation, but I was so scared. Later in the presentation, the presenter talked about how if you say you don't care about your pronouns, you're being dismissive of gender minorities, and you're likely relying on your privilege of being assumed to be a gender you are comfortable with. Which makes sense, but it made me want to disappear. 

&amp;#x200B;

So right now I just feel confused and crappy. Is it wrong that I didn't want to identify a pronoun? I just want people to choose what feels natural to them. Am I taking advantage of my privilege? Do I need to feel dysphoric to not be a cis person? I don't know what I am yet, but I'm scared that what feels natural to me is hurtful and offensive to many.

616,2018-11-29 11:27:22,a1gjfo,11,1,"I’m a butch/androgynous bi woman and I’ve been questioning for a couple of months now. In my early 20s (I’m now 26) I considered myself very feminine, had long hair and wore these amazing 50s style swing dresses which was a lot of fun (you get so many random compliments if you wear a big poofy dress with underskirt out in public).

Over the past few years I’ve phased makeup out of my routine and started dressing for comfort and to express my queerness. I’m in a happy LTR with a straight guy who loves me and affirms my sexuality, but I often feel erased by outside parties when not actively dating or seeking women. I leaned hard into the short hair/plaid shirts/singular earring aesthetic and experienced what I can only describe as gender euphoria for the first time.

...Which leads on to my first major DYSphoric experience. I had to find an outfit for a friend’s “summer” wedding on limited time and budget. I don’t know shit all about fashion or formal wear and needed something smart but seasonally appropriate that also wasn’t too feminine. The stress of outfit hunting and the invalidation in going around women’s clothing stores and finding only clothes that were too delicate and femme for my presentation and (broad, plus size) bodytype threw me into a gender panic. I had a mini-melt down at work where I suddenly felt intensely like my gender was wrong, that everyone else’s perception of my gender was wrong...I felt physically light headed and queasy, it was like being hit with a bat.

Since then I’ve noticed a torrent of little things like the fact that I don’t mind family and close friends viewing me as female, but I feel deeply uncomfortable when people I come into contact with through my work, or store assistants in other businesses etc “assume” my gender and “treat me like a woman”. I’ve asked for male uniform items at work and feel I’m more comfortable, and I feel invalidated when I share selfies only for friends to make comments about me being “pretty”. (They’re only being nice, but I feel like I’ m fairly visibly trying to present masculinely so it feels like they’re forcing themselves to say it because “surely it’s what girls want to hear”).

I don’t really know what I’m meant to be feeling or looking for. I might just be a masculine-of-centre cis woman whose dysphoria comes not from any discomfort with being female, but from society expecting me to look/feel/be a certain way because of that. Or I could be enby, but it’s so hard as a female queer woman to separate what signs are my soul trying to tell me “this is the shape of my gender” and what’s just society/my conditioning trying to force something different on me than what I am.

This entire post is a mess but I guess that’s accurate to where my head’s at right now... If this is too big a mess to pick through I guess I have some more straightforward questions:

1) Can you be Enby and still favour the pronouns you’ve known your whole life? I’ve experimented a little with “they” but “she” feels most personal to me despite the fact I don’t like being “treated” as female.

2) What were your personal journeys like when it came to untangling your identity?

My biggest source of dysphoria is my body. I have really large breasts, lose tummy skin and stretch marks from pregnancy. I gave birth almost two years ago. No matter how much I exercise I can’t get my stomach to go away. Looking in the mirror has been really painful lately.

I’m still not sure if hormones are the right path for me, because I don’t think I want my voice to change or deal with body hair. I know we don’t get to “pick and choose,” but I do wonder if T would help with the fat distribution from my curves. It will be a long while before I can make that decision. 

I live in a state with informed consent, and have Kaiser Permanete. Their gender health program is supposed to be pretty great, but I am wondering to what extent they are willing to help. I know I could get a breast reduction covered, but do you think they would cover something like a tummy tuck? Or would they view that as not “necessary”? To what extent would I have to go to show how significantly my stomach exacerbates my dysphoria? 

I feel grateful to have had the opportunity to carry my daughter, and my partner is MTF and is the most supportive. But I have this parent-guilt of being deeply ashamed of my body...  

Just wondering if any fellow AFAB have dealt with anything like this, and if they have experience with insurance covering/not covering surgeries.

Idk where to start. I'd like to know if im trans, or just weird. Im very confused and nervous at the moment, about sex, about transness (?) myself and my sexuality all that good stuff. 

I was born as a guy and I've never felt unsatisfied with myself or my body. Im sorry if this offends trans people because i feel like I'd like to be trans for the wrong reasons. This might be kind of straight forward, anyway here goes:

About a year ago i experimented a bit with masturbation and i had a kind of phase where i inserted dildo-like objects in my butt because i was kind of longing/drawn towards the feeling of being penetrated. I did this for a few months and then it passed because it wasnt worth the preparation (the whole shave your ass, wash it inside out, wash the toys, it was very time consuming). At that point i kind of started to question my straightness and my first thought was that i might be gay, but i wasnt attracted to guys so i was kinda confused. Anyway that phase passed and i accepted im just straight with a mild penetration fetish. I kept that mentality until a few days ago, when my gf and i were talking about her being slightly confused about her sexuality (in case you're interested she might be bi or lesbian we haven't figured it out yet but i support her wherever she finds comfort) and we moved on to mine. I told her I'd like to have the pleasures a girl has for example multiple orgasms or being turned on and getting wet or just one female orgasm, because apparently girls experience orgasms differently from guys. Guys have a very short intense experience, whereas girls (from what I've read) have longer, smoother and more emotional orgasms. I really like the idea of that. Even during sex i feel like i would feel better if i had female genitalia instead of male. Don't get me wrong i love sex and finishing i just feel like I'd be more satisfied if i were the one being penetrated.

I've done some research about being trans and i kind of relate but not totally. This is what has me so confused about my sexuality. I dont (think) i feel body dysmorphia, i like my body and my face. I look slightly more feminine than an average guy so i guess that might weigh into it. What I do kind of feel is a slight dissatisfaction about my penis. I feel like had it been a vagina, i would be more satisfied sexually. But then i think ""wouldnt it be weird if i had a vagina but no breasts and no feminine hormones?"" so im considering it all, and it makes me nervous and scared. I suppose i coukd start taking hormones but even thats a n enormous step. Im in the middle of puberty so i dont know if this feeling of insecurity and dissatisfaction comes from fucked up hormones and a brain going through development, or if im actually trans, to some degree. Now about the mental thing, honestly, i wouldnt mind being a girl. It sounds awesome. I also behave kind of not-so-manly so i guess it wouldn't be that big of a change to try and be a girl for a while.

I'd like to have some advice from the trans-community about the transition from HRT and how it can affect me, to dressing like a girl, haircuts, surgery, sex. Everything. Im just very confused and I'd like to hear your honest opinion about the whole thing. Thanks for reading, I look forward to your responses 💜💙💚❤️

I've always completely hated gender roles/stereotypes/norms, do whatever you want regardless of how your gender ""normally"" acts. So my issue is this: how do you support the abolishment of gender stereotypes when as a trans you sort of reinforce them?

I've looked into this question before and the best argument I've seen is that it's not about wanting to be like what you perceive the opposite gender to be, its more about literally feeling like your body is the incorrect sex; more of a physical thing than a cultural thing. This is a very solid argument, but if that's the case it brings up another issue with me: How is it different than other body dismorphia disorders? Is the trans community open to the idea of trans-racial? My experience so far is that the answer is no, trans is supported in terms of gender/sex, but not any other aspects.

I want to better understand.

31,2018-11-02 08:50:30,9tiarg,12,1,"I'm doing a show as part of course, my classmates and I all wrote plays and we're working together to put them on as a collection of short pieces in about a week's time. The pieces are all pretty varied in nature and two that I am performing in are a musical fluff piece and a play about a gay man at his jewish boyfriends funeral as a sad but really sweet ending to the whole show.

 Part of the whole process for us is collaboration with the other courses in the art department such as makeup, live production (All the important tech stuff) and costume. From the first meeting with costume, one of the students decided to that she had issues with both the pieces. Lets just call her P. P's objection to the second script seemed solely based of the subject matter which was further reinforced on her dropping her complaint when she found out the author was a gay Jewish man. 

P's complaint about the musical piece was slightly more faceted. In it a teenage boy uses song and charm to make his way through a day at school. Think saved by the bell meets high school musical almost. There is a scene within this where the boy goes to the canteen to get his lunch and he misidentifies the lunchlady, apologises, serenades her and gets a plate of cookies for charming her.

B. Excuse me sir this cupcake is saggy
L: I ain't no sir, I'm a lady. 
B:I'm so sorry ms… moose, I feel like such a goose, really more of a duck, but do you really give a-
Now I didn't actually say this, what I said was actually a lot more charming and went something like this 
🎵I apologise, dear mademoiselle moose, 
I didn't know you were a female,
It's my fault, it's all my fault
You're beautiful 🎵

This was and by extension, the director (not the writer) was deemed transphobic by P and in response the director said he would speak to the artistic director and pass on the message but that he doubted anything would come of it. In her telling of the story she was told a blatant no at this point but that's just untrue. From this point on the timeline it gets a little hazy because rather than going through the proper channels to complain P would end discussions seemingly on a note of appeasement only to come back having escalated the situation. That being said I do know that these things occurred in more less this order: 

she refused to talk to my teacher, the Artistic Director (AD) with the frequently used power to make edits to the scripts or her teacher so that complaint could be handled before it was formalised. 

She emailed the course director for the arts courses a complaint which never made it to him. Whether this was a fault on her part or his was never made clear but it did seem that it was a failure on her part to send it properly.

AND THIS IS THE BIG ONE
she took a photo of his script which she obtained for use in costume design and shared it with at least 20 of her friends outside of the school on a Facebook story and urged them to complain to my school with a complaints url she attached. 10 of this were returned and have to be individually responded to 

She contacted Transgender Victoria and had them send a rep to assess the scene. 

All of this happened before P had even seen the piece by the way, she had only read an outdated version of the script, the lunchlady character was also never trans but just androgynous.

A week out from the show and during the tech runs that were already running hours over time (anyone who works around a stage knows the stress that those runs can entail) the rep from Trans Vic came into the theatre and watched the scene and afterwards myself, the director, the writer of the piece, a trans man and a non binary individual within the class who both had watched the scene hundreds of times and agreed the trope was old hat but it was never offensive went into the foyer with the course director, the AD ,P and the Trans Vic reps. Immediately into sitting down P asks it to be a private meeting. The AD tries to make her understand that as the writer, director, performer of the role and relevant “offended parties” we really should be there but relents and sends the students out of the room. 
Not only were we not allowed to speak in defence of the piece but we didn't even get to hear their complaints. 

We came back in the room as they were leaving to the conclusion that all the dialogue for the lunchlady (my character) whom we have spent months workshopping and building is cut, and that a whole new costume needs to be made for the character that's “less female”

So now we're a week from the show, there's a new load of work to do with changing the script, learning it, changing sound and lighting cues and making another costume. 
I'm a cisgendered male performer so I'm not the authority on what people should be offended by but jokes in poor taste aside the way this was handled has left a lot of people rather pissed off. Sharing his script on a social platform and calling her friends to brigade it to us feels like a possible instance of defamation and an almost certain copyright infringement in her abuse of his intellectual property. We have a lot more work ahead of us now and had she handled it through the proper channels it could've been long resolved but instead by making it about her and being the signal of virtue it's put us all through the ringer

But I didn't write this to read what I have to say so I wanted share it here. Alll through the process people kept talking about being offensive and what constituted that but during the discussion a trans person didn't even get to have their say on what they thought and P was speaking on the behalf of a community they weren't a part of

35,2018-11-02 16:54:02,9tlv9a,7,1,"So tonight I bumped into some old friends at a bar, and ended up coming out as trans. It was a lovely experience, they were great about it and we even had a few laughs- they're the kind of friends who you can joke with about anything and it was refreshing to not have to be so solemn and serious about it. Of this group there was one who caught up with me after we all parted, and who I talked with before getting on the train. 

He wanted to talk to me away from the rest because he barely ever gets to talk to me (for context this is the first time all those friends have seen me in ages too- I've been barely able to afford to feed myself much less go to parties, I have reasons for being distant from my friends) and he took issue with me apparently not listening to other people's experiences enough and just talking about my experience. Which I admit is something I've struggled with my whole life- I was raised by narcissistic parents and every day I try to not be that. I'm aware of my tendency to talk about myself a lot and instinctively, and try to listen more. Which I did- my friends and I talked about what was going on in their lives first and my decision to come out was spur of the moment. 

But the main reason I'm writing this is that some of the things he said relating to coming out as trans worried me. He referred to the whole 'gender thing' as a 'strange and complex world' he 'doesn't like to venture into', and kept on talking about my long term job prospects years in the future as something I should think about, and when I said that due to transitioning it's hard for me to think years ahead job and career wise because transitioning will affect what I can do there. He said that there's not just 'one straight path' and I told him that if I don't transition there isn't a future for me that I can see. He then talked about maybe being an 'advocate or spokesperson for trans issues' and it was unclear to me if he was trying to say that I should consider things other than transitioning? He also kept on saying it's good I came out and talked about communication issues with other friends.

It was a lovely experience, they were great about it and we even had a few laughs- they're the kind of friends who you can joke with about anything and it was refreshing to not have to be so solemn and serious about it. Of this group there was one who caught up with me after we all parted, and who I talked with before getting on the train. \n\nHe wanted to talk to me away from the rest because he barely ever gets to talk to me (for context this is the first time all those friends have seen me in ages too- I've been barely able to afford to feed myself much less go to parties, I have reasons for being distant from my friends) and he took issue with me apparently not listening to other people's experiences enough and just talking about my experience. Which I admit is something I've struggled with my whole life- I was raised by narcissistic parents and every day I try to not be that. I'm aware of my tendency to talk about myself a lot and instinctively, and try to listen more. Which I did- my friends and I talked about what was going on in their lives first and my decision to come out was spur of the moment. \n\nBut the main reason I'm writing this is that some of the things he said relating to coming out as trans worried me. He referred to the whole 'gender thing' as a 'strange and complex world' he 'doesn't like to venture into', and kept on talking about my long term job prospects years in the future as something I should think about, and when I said that due to transitioning it's hard for me to think years ahead job and career wise because transitioning will affect what I can do there. He said that there's not just 'one straight path' and I told him that if I don't transition there isn't a future for me that I can see. He then talked about maybe being an 'advocate or spokesperson for trans issues' and it was unclear to me if he was trying to say that I should consider things other than transitioning? He also kept on saying it's good I came out and talked about communication issues with other friends. \n\nI'm not sure. I don't know if I'm being paranoid, I am prone to it- truth be told my mental state hasn't been good, and my critical thinking skills have been affected as much as I hate to admit.

I’ve just never been fully happy with it. I thought that maybe if my body were just lean with some muscle I’d then like it more. And to some degree that remains true. I said/did some “eggy” things growing up, I can see that now, but I never bothered to question my gender. I just went along with what I was told who I was (I never knew being trans was a thing until later in my life)

Now with a new and fresh perspective, I have a whole new “egg” outlook on things. If I could flip a switch and be given a feminine body, would I do it? I would likely lean to saying yes. I’d have some conditions if I were to do that however. I don’t fully reject my masculine side, so in essence to have a feminine body but appear more androgynous would be ideal.

I’m sorry if this isn’t allowed since this is my first post here, but I just need to get this off my chest. Also, it’s late where I live, so i might reply late to comments.

My ex was a horrible person doing a great job of hiding it. He was a puppy, needed all of my attention and barely thought for himself. He was a bigot with a disdain for women and trans people. I thought we could fix that, he hid it from me instead. He was emotionally manipulative by making small things seem huge, thus making huge things seem small. He, on one occasion, exchanged dick pics with a stranger through Grindr (we were supposed to be monogamous) and gaslighted me into consoling him. He wouldn’t tell me what happened, came to my place and forced me to get it out of him. Then he drowned himself in self-pity. i had to help him get himself back together. I’m still processing that to this day, because I was robbed of the opportunity at the time. This was not the end of us though. I simply persevered like my friends advised me to. Until one day I decided to do something different: cross dressing (I was very much an egg). It felt great to look, even if unconvincingly, like a woman, but he didn’t think it was great. Long story short: he locked himself in his room until I was “me” again (as if I wasn’t me). When he finally seemed ready to discuss the whole debacle I had been “a thing out of his worst nightmares”. Something snapped and I nearly ended our relationship there. I was dumb though and I didn’t. Over time I lost my feelings for him, that former love had become dulled. I discussed this with him and we decided to take a break. I broke up with him nearly a year ago. Afterwards he quickly reverted to his bigoted self, aided by a group of horrible friends.

When I say horrible friends I want to add that this concerns a small in-group within a larger cluster of people. Those uninvolved likely didn’t know much of anything. These people, who would casually use the nazi salute (including the chant) to greet each other (I’m guilty of initially going along with it, not gonna lie), allowed my ex to be as much of a shit as he wanted. I was gaslighted into becoming friends with him again way before I was even ready to decide whether or not I wanted that. I fell for it. Until the midway point of summer we were “friends”. The group, in the period before the breakup and until at least last summer, planned a lot of activities. A constantly decreasing amount of which I was invited to. Excuses would always be made: “we planned it spontaneously” or “you live too far away” (an hour at most) amongst others. Even when a car was involved I was never asked along. The first few times I believed it, after the fourth I knew what was going on. This all came to its conclusion on my ex’s birthday. He was being transphobic (the attack helicopter thing), as per usual, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I gave him a small kick against his leg and told him to leave me alone. The group was angry at my use of violence (which I admit I probably shouldn’t have) and condoned his behaviour. I picked up my final things from his place two days later only to receive a final slap in the face. The group had banded together to buy my ex the newest iPad and I hadn’t been involved at all. I finished my final obligations to them (a funeral service of sorts) and left them.

In hindsight I’m happy I left him and that group behind, because I would have never realised my transness if I had stayed.

I’m sharing this with my non-existent followers because I need to vent about how I’ve been treated by people who claimed to be my friends, yet clearly weren’t.

Excuses would always be made: “we planned it spontaneously” or “you live too far away” (an hour at most) amongst others. Even when a car was involved I was never asked along. The first few times I believed it, after the fourth I knew what was going on. This all came to its conclusion on my ex’s birthday. He was being transphobic (the attack helicopter thing), as per usual, and I couldn’t take it anymore. I gave him a small kick against his leg and told him to leave me alone. The group was angry at my use of violence (which I admit I probably shouldn’t have) and condoned his behaviour. I picked up my final things from his place two days later only to receive a final slap in the face. The group had banded together to buy my ex the newest iPad and I hadn’t been involved at all. I finished my final obligations to them (a funeral service of sorts) and left them.\n\nIn hindsight I’m happy I left him and that group behind, because I would have never realised my transness if I had stayed.\n\nI’m sharing this because I need to vent about how I’ve been treated by people who claimed to be my friends, yet clearly weren’t. I gave them more than two months to try and contact me, to see if they perhaps did care, but that was futile. If a breakup is a choice between two people they first tried everything to get the breakup to not impact anyone of them and when that failed they chose the bigot over me.', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Venting about transphobic ex and shit friends (long and not particularly on topic) (CW: transphobia, nazi-related stuff)', 'created': 1541227427.0}"

I have 2 major concerns about this and many smaller so if you read through all of what I will type in an effort to help me then you have my gratitude!

Well my first major concern lies with how long he's admitting to feeling he wants to change, he said he's been contemplating it for 2 years, on and off talking and a little research here and there, but I feel he's not thought long enough and hard enough for this life changing decision, on top of that, I fear he hasn't looked at the bad side of the change, as in what can go wrong how a huge majority mistreat trans people... That's where my second major concern comes in, he is not very mentally strong, he is very easily upset and anger etc. (we believe he suffers with a hyper sensitive personality disorder, though he needs to seek a professional to know for sure) and I seriously fear that of something went wrong through the procedure, or the negative backlash from people would possibly drive him to suicide hotlines and maybe even to suicide...

Other concerns I have include people mistreating him where I cannot help if he goes through, because if he does then our relationship will end, and like that I cannot help him in private situations...

I also worry that I heard trans people are more susceptible to STD's something that may play heavy on him...

Another concern I have is money... I am not aware of how much a full transition costs, but I would assume it is certainly not on the cheap side of things...

60,2018-11-04 06:17:26,9u1ecd,16,1,"Hi there, cis mom of 2 cis kids (I presume) and one gender-expansive one whom we’ll call “Diego”.

Around age 3 “Paloma” not the real name) began asking when she would grow a penis like her older brothers. I assumed this was just because she looked up to them so much.  She dressed like them, she was even tougher and more adventurous than them in some ways.
Parents of a MTF child told me to “get ready” as this was how their child presented. Others said “she just idolizes her brothers”.

At age 5 we moved she made a new friend (also age 5) who had recently socially transitioned FTM with a new name. She only knew her new friend had a vulva because he showed her once. So we had an age-appropriate discussion about it.

Then Paloma (who had been dressing in boys clothes for about a year) began to say things like:
“When I get older I won’t have boobs like yours.”
“What will you have?”
“Something else”

Right before he turned 6 I asked him when people say “him” did he want me to continue correcting them. His answer: No. So we stopped.

A few weeks later he asked to be called Diego. For the last 5 months he has been a boy, Diego, and enjoying it. Everyone has adjusted very well to it.

Not long after this he angrily asked me:
“Why didn’t you know I was Diego when I was born?”

3 months ago we cut off all his hair. My husband has been supportive of everything else but this was one thing he was loathe to let go of. I finally just took him to get it cut. Diego was super happy with it.

We sifted through his nicer clothes today and he opted to: keep the clip on tie my mom bought him for the last wedding we attended (he ended up not wearing it but was in “boy” clothes otherwise) and even asked to keep the few dresses he still has “in case we go to a wedding”.

The only time he chose to wear a dress was on my bday a month ago. He said that when he wears a dress like if we go eat out, to call him Paloma, but otherwise it’s Diego.

Advice? Tips? How can I continue to support his journey?

Female to male. Now from first glance you would mistake her for female. Mostly because of the way she dresses, acts and even speaks. Its like extremely exaggerated feminine actions. I'm not exactly friends with her more like acquaintances. Lets call her P for simplicity purposes.

So we were talking with a small ground of friends and P mentions how she doesn't really have dysphoria and that you don't really need it to be trans. So that's kinda my question for here. At least one of them. I'm gonna type them out and I hope you can answer in the comments.


1. If a person doesn't have dysphoria then can they be trans?

2. Is dysphoria actually classified as a mental illness.

3. What are y'alls opinions on the terms 'trans-tenders?'

4.What are your thoughts on the type of person who seems exaggerated. I mean the people you see on YouTube in cringe compilations.

5. What are y'alls thoughts on people making up genders.

Back when I was 17 I started to get feelings like I wasn't a boy and wanted to be a girl, months of research and tumblr browsing (this was 2013 after all) I felt like I was confident enough to confirm to myself and a few close friends that I was trans. One thing is that my body is pretty masculine, and a defining feature of myself was a big beard, even at this age, though I often kept my hair long.

Suddenly, I end up in an LDR with one of the friends I opened up to. She and I have an okay start to our relationship but it quickly becomes toxic and manipulative, which lead to her cheating and it ending about a year later. But during this relationship, about a few months in I stopped feeling the same feelings I used to have. I figured at the time that thinking I was trans was just a phase and moved on with my life.

After my last relationship, I ended up in another relationship, which lasted 3 years and I could copy paste the last paragraph and it'd be just as accurate to describe this one as well for the purposes of this story. But nearing the end, I was feeling slight twinges of my old feelings when I'd see really cute girls doing cosplay. This surprised me since I thought that these were feelings long since buried.

Cut now to about ~3 months out of that last relationship, and all of my old feelings have come back in full. Now that I'm thinking of myself and no longer wanting to simply please someone by presenting myself in the way they want me to.

It's not been as simple as flicking a switch and I now know I'm trans, there's so many things going on in my head. As I explained it to my trans friend, I don't feel like I'm 100% one or the other, but my feminine side doesn't feel comfortable in a masculine body, but my masculine side is obviously fine with it. I believe this is why I don't experience dysphoria that much since my front facing side is masculine, but I feel this need and want to be female. I told her that it's hard to decide between the two since the male and female are both equally important to shaping my personality. It's just that one of those sides really wants to have a home and body it feels comfortable in, since the male side is comfortable either way.

So I recently came across an article on /r/metacanada, which is a hate subreddit. It has the following title: ""Science finds 1,500 genetic differences between boys and girls, destroys ‘transgender’ arguments"" ([link here](https://np.reddit.com/r/metacanada/comments/9sra5h/science_finds_1500_genetic_differences_between/e8rqqy6/)). [Here's all the times this article has been reposted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/metacanada/duplicates/9sra5h/science_finds_1500_genetic_differences_between/) A google search for the title of the article shows that various blogs have been linking it for this reason for almost a year. 

This is amusing, because the actual title of the article is ""The landscape of sex-differential transcriptome and its consequent selection in human adults"". 

The key word here is ""transcriptome"". That means RNA, not DNA. **Why is this an important distinction?** Because the transcriptome is variable. It changes to suit the needs of an organism - changes in the transcriptome can result in variations in gene expression. In other words, the impact of a particular gene is regulated in part by RNA. 

There's more detail in the paper's Background section: 

&gt; In all cases, **males and females have identical genetic information across most of their genomes, but harbor many distinct sex-specific characteristics. For example, mammalian offspring depend on maternal lactation in their early life.** ... However, genes involved in lactation are also carried by males, who do not express this trait [2]. ... It is thus expected that the vast majority of sexually dimorphic traits are due to differential expression of genes that are present in both sexes [21]. 

If literally anyone in that thread had browsed through the article, they could have had a bigger number than 1,500, too: ""... there are over 6,500 protein-coding genes with significant SDE (sex differential expression) in at least one tissue."" Although, an observant reader might notice that the next line is: ""The most sex-differentiated tissue, with 6123 SDE (sex differentially expressed) protein-coding genes, is the breast mammary glands..."" to no one's surprise. 

So, we've learned:
1. Women grow boobs.
2. This is responsible for about 94% of the sex-differentiation in the transcriptome (by number of genes).

I try so hard to do things properly and I used to think I was good at navigating bureaucratic systems, but I've finally hit a wall and am becoming more desperate.

I'm trying and failing to find a healthcare provider that will even return my call for an apointment, I can't find any resources that aren't like a decade out of date for Virginia, and my prescription for hormones runs out in 2 weeks. On top of this, my insurance is refusing to pay for any of my counceling so I may need to stop seeing a therapist soon too.

I'm happy that the election went well in a lot of districts, but overall I am not optimistic that I'll ever be able to afford the healthcare I need as long as american politicians deny us universal healthcare. I have insurance, but it's nearly worthless because my deductable is several thousands of dollars before they'll even pay a penny, renewed annually.

I have a good job, but it doesn't pay enough for out of pocket transgender care. I'm gaining weight and probably destroying my liver by eating and drinking to cope with all the stress.

149,2018-11-09 00:14:39,9vfj38,8,1,"Hey all, finding myself in a weird place. To give a little back story, I’ve been making some cascading life changes for the past few years, and I’ve been doing a bit of healing. I keep finding myself in new(er) places in my mind and life. 

Growing up, I remember really liking female characters in movies and cartoons, especially if they were the hero and / or pretty. Being a man (boy then), I would envision I was their male counterpart.

I never fit in with most men/boys. I was usually picked on in groups of boys. I was / am pretty athletic. I am also pretty shy, though I do get nervous and ramble in group settings. For whatever reason, it’s as if I was always the outcast, though due to athleticism and intelligence, I was ‘accepted’ into the group due to being useful I guess (trying to not sound conceited but explain why groups of my own gender seemed to accept me).

On the contrary, as young as 5th or 6th grade, I had very many friends of the opposite sex. I was the first boy who sat with an all girl table during lunch (if you can recall those days). I preferred the conversation. Girls would explain things to me - friendships / relationships / boy stuff / girl stuff. I didn’t grow up in a great home. Lots of abuse and I was alone a lot. I am a proficient self learner as a result. In the neighborhood I grew up in, I would hang out with older high school aged girls. Looking back, there were definitely some “signs” I missed. Not saying that were looking to take advantage of a younger boy, but they’d invite me over when their parents weren’t home to hang out alone. I was a later bloomer when it came to puberty, so that was also a huge factor on that note. But I do feel as if I was being courted to a degree. I just thought they were really pretty and liked being around these young women and spending time with them.

In high school, my hormones raged for girls. In my twenties my bisexuality started to flourish. But in those days, my body yearned for women and their parts. I believe my early pull to having female friends at a young age helped me be successful with dating and physical relationships at that stage of life. A lot of young women at that age told me things I didn’t quite grasp - I knew how to touch them. My attention to their needs, and appreciation of their bodies and intimates made me appealing. I really enjoyed their underwear and clothes they wore. Maybe not more than other boys did, but more than a few indicated that my appreciation was different in both an arousing and fulfilling way for them. I’m not sure if that makes sense. I understand it now, but it’s hard to communicate in text.

Now I am a 30 year old man. I’ve never questioned my sexuality. When my bisexuality flourished, I did have a period of time where it was new and scary, and thus I developed avoidant behaviors. I sought therapy, and that’s when the “cascading” life changes began to happen. I became ok with liking men and women as sexual and romantic partners. I’ve now been dating both, and feeling fulfilled in relationships with both. I recently just quit a toxic job and am finally feeling some things I’ve never quite felt before in my life.

All my life I’ve never been sure of where I fit. I never developed my own “style” of appearance like some people do. I hesitate to say most, but I definitely was/am one of those people that followed trends - not because I wanted to be trendy, but because I didn’t know what I wanted so I just did what everyone else did / wore. I’ve struggled with finding things about myself or that I enjoy that I can “call my own”. Due to bottoming with men, and my enjoyment of that, I’ve learned to embrace more “feminine” things. To give an example, I was always very aroused by sexy bra and panties on my girlfriends. So once I became ok with my sexuality with men, I began to experiment with sexier cuts of underwear, but for the male anatomy. That was a huge thing for me because it gave me so much confidence in myself and I began to feel that I did something (in regards to appearance) that was “for me”. 

I’ve never really fit with men (as I stated above). And I’ve never had the type of infatuation with my penis that most men seem to have (varying degrees obviously). In fact, other than as a vehicle for pleasure for myself and my partner, I’m really ambivalent about it, truth be told. Also due to the bottoming, I’ve had the natural thoughts of - what would this feel like if I had a vagina? I feel like most people have these thoughts, so I’m not trying to be romantic. 

And then something happened to me last night. A show I’ve been watching, that I’ve honestly been sort of “meh” about as a whole, began a lesbian narrative that recaptured my attention. The scenes for the narrative were well done, and there was something about some of the sex scenes with a specific character, in the way her body was reacting (I get it’s acting but it actually was not a typical Hollywood sex scene in my humble opinion) that struck a chord in me. Then, her love interest invites her to a lesbian bar where a bunch of women were dancing. As a man, I know I’m not welcome in those spaces, even as a member of the community, but I felt very strongly that “wow - those look like my people. I wish I was there dancing with these wonderful women.”

And right there is where I went.. wait... do I want to be a woman? Have I always? Am I just confused? I started to give myself space to just exist and not over think it, and I began to realize a lot of my nervous behaviors that sometimes make others view me as odd or make them dislike me, often stemmed from me being confused as to how a boy / man should act, so inevitably I’d overcompensate. I’ve always been told by my family, coaches, professors, mentors, that I’m a leader and I need to step up and be a man. But last night made me wonder - is the reason I struggle so hard to do this because I don’t actually identify as one? I’m not trying to jump to conclusions but it was such a profound “click” in my brain that I haven’t been able to get it out. I do find women sexually and romantically attractive, but it was something about those characters. Their interactions, their clothing / appearance. The dancing. It just made something in my brain click into place. 

I’ve always tried dating trans folks and haven’t been successful. I find both sexes to be attractive. I tend to get ghosted. The last relationship I had was with a trans woman with whom I had a strong connection with, both emotionally and physically. We never did more than kiss and hand hold, but it was one of those very strong chemistry type kiss and hand holds that both parties sort of blush and acknowledge as less common, and thus more coveted. She ended up ghosting me. I found out later from a mutual acquaintance that she was in a relationship with a gay man and they were looking to become a throuple (is that the right word?) and I guess she had been trying to bring it up for some time, but kept chickening out. We spent weeks talking, and then weeks hanging out in public places (trans women experience violence from men so she was being cautious which I respected). Apparently the night in question when we were hanging out and hand holding / kissing, she asked a question along the lines of “would you ever do a three person relationship?” - I do remember this line of conversation, and I remember actually answering in my typical nonchalant overcompensating man way “no I think I’m a one woman man. Or one man man.” I felt the need as the “man” to sort of assure her. I guess I assured my way out of her life lol, but I digress. 

So my TL:DR if anyone has bothered to read this - how did you know? I’m definitely not making an appointment at a clinic for hormones. I’m definitely not ruling it out for the future, either. I’ve just never felt like being a man suited me. I guess I never considered that inside I might identify as a woman. It makes sense that I would, given everything I’ve tried to explain. But what I’ve always felt and acknowledged is that part of why I struggle is I don’t know what type of man I want to be. I’ve always tried to dream up and act upon versions of the type of man I think I want to be, but it never felt right so I’d sort of just fade out from whatever it was I was trying to accomplish. Has anyone ever felt like this? I did spend time looking at dresses and outfits today and was really aroused and interested in exploring that. That was also a first for me. If anyone has any input they’d like to offer, I would honestly love to hear it. I’m not sad or depressed about this, so please don’t feel obligated. In fact this “click” I felt has actually awoken something in me. I feel very “on the right path” - if that makes sense. It may turn out this is just a phase, or a furthering of my already expanding gender fluid ways. Who knows. I just wanted to hear from others to see if any of what I’m saying resonates with anyone else.

Thanks!",trans,When and how did you know?,1541747679.0,"{'created_utc': 1541722479, 'id': '9vfj38', 'num_comments': 8, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hey all, finding myself in a weird place. To give a little back story, I’ve been making some cascading life changes for the past few years, and I’ve been doing a bit of healing. I keep finding myself in new(er) places in my mind and life. \n\nGrowing up, I remember really liking female characters in movies and cartoons, especially if they were the hero and / or pretty. Being a man (boy then), I would envision I was their male counterpart.\n\nI never fit in with most men/boys. I was usually picked on in groups of boys. I was / am pretty athletic. I am also pretty shy, though I do get nervous and ramble in group settings. For whatever reason, it’s as if I was always the outcast, though due to athleticism and intelligence, I was ‘accepted’ into the group due to being useful I guess (trying to not sound conceited but explain why groups of my own gender seemed to accept me).\n\nOn the contrary, as young as 5th or 6th grade, I had very many friends of the opposite sex. I was the first boy who sat with an all girl table during lunch (if you can recall those days). I preferred the conversation. Girls would explain things to me - friendships / relationships / boy stuff / girl stuff. I didn’t grow up in a great home. Lots of abuse and I was alone a lot. I am a proficient self learner as a result. In the neighborhood I grew up in, I would hang out with older high school aged girls. Looking back, there were definitely some “signs” I missed. Not saying that were looking to take advantage of a younger boy, but they’d invite me over when their parents weren’t home to hang out alone. I was a later bloomer when it came to puberty, so that was also a huge factor on that note. But I do feel as if I was being courted to a degree. I just thought they were really pretty and liked being around these young women and spending time with them.\n\nIn high school, my hormones raged for girls. In my twenties my bisexuality started to flourish. But in those days, my body yearned for women and their parts. I believe my early pull to having female friends at a young age helped me be successful with dating and physical relationships at that stage of life. A lot of young women at that age told me things I didn’t quite grasp - I knew how to touch them. My attention to their needs, and appreciation of their bodies and intimates made me appealing. I really enjoyed their underwear and clothes they wore. Maybe not more than other boys did, but more than a few indicated that my appreciation was different in both an arousing and fulfilling way for them. I’m not sure if that makes sense. I understand it now, but it’s hard to communicate in text.\n\nNow I am a 30 year old man. I’ve never questioned my sexuality. When my bisexuality flourished, I did have a period of time where it was new and scary, and thus I developed avoidant behaviors. I sought therapy, and that’s when the “cascading” life changes began to happen. I became ok with liking men and women as sexual and romantic partners. I’ve now been dating both, and feeling fulfilled in relationships with both. I recently just quit a toxic job and am finally feeling some things I’ve never quite felt before in my life.\n\nAll my life I’ve never been sure of where I fit. I never developed my own “style” of appearance like some people do. I hesitate to say most, but I definitely was/am one of those people that followed trends - not because I wanted to be trendy, but because I didn’t know what I wanted so I just did what everyone else did / wore.

He is starting TODAY and i wont even be able to start the process until i turn 18.\n\nIts frustrating because im so jealous and upset, i keep thinking awful things. I pass better than him, he acts SO girly and he doesnt even seem to care, but everyone accepts him because his parents are supportive. I know these are awful things to think, but im finding every way to be upset right now. My teachers arent even allowed to call me my name.

193,2018-11-11 15:38:40,9w4on9,0,1,"Obs! I base this message of personal experiences and from what I have read in other articles.

&amp;#x200B;

It is interesting to see how transmen are not nearly portrayed in as a negative light as

transwomen. For one thing transwomen get a lot more publicity and are looked down on, and seen

as traps and fake. Yet there is a pretty even distribution of MTFs and FTMs.

&amp;#x200B;

Just because someone grows up as a specific gender biologically they are placed in circumstances

where they have to learn to be a certain way to be included and practically brainwashed. Based of

or physical appearances we are divided and taught to make these divisions clearer by being each

others opposites gender wise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many transpersons live after these expectations as it is so hardly imprinted in most people's

minds that things are black and white. There are a lot of intersex conditions, and also transpeople

have been shown in studies to have underlying biological explanations, and even then there is

the emotional and energetic level humans not yet understand well through science at least.

&amp;#x200B;

A person born male but feeling the opposite will probably suppress their inner self because

they have grown up with expectation of being what they look like and we live in a society where

feelings matter less than facts. So this transwoman will have dysphoria usually but be confused about

what is up or/and try to suppress this. Both because of fear of being looked down on, rejection and

being an outcast. Their families will have a hard time seeing what has not been there physically

or visibly, and in many cases explain it away as something that is not real.

&amp;#x200B;

People who are not transgender, will not always understand that this is real and have only recently

been seeing transpeople portrayed in a negative light in movies or through media lately.

Thus thinking all these ""new"" trans people are fake and only coming to light because it is in the

media a lot more. However, the truth is, this is a movement where people will start to reveal

their true selves when they see others doing it and feel more empowered and comfortable as it is more

public. It is not a result of just jumping on an interesting new trend.

&amp;#x200B;

People who are not transgender will just see this new publicity and new found concepts in media and

think that it is just something weird people want to try out or similar(that is my understanding of

some people). They did not know about this before and think it just recently came into being.

But it has always been there. People are not used to this and to them it seems surreal, awkward, strange,

weird and they might be uncomfortable or feel like something is being taken from their gender.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are a cisperson(feeling like the gender you were born), then imagine for a second that you were

born in the opposite gender or somewhere in-between. Imagine that you somehow have a constant nagging

gut-feeling that something is wrong. It is the fact that you are not what you seem like. It is

like suddenly waking up in another life and another gender, with new memories but a sense, a feeling that

you are supposed to be something else. This is what it is about.

&amp;#x200B;

Being a transperson is not a decision, and not necessarily something you want. It is something that

just IS. Just like many people just are comfortable with the gender they are born with. It just is

a state of being.

&amp;#x200B;

With all disease existing and so on in a modern world of chemicals being used without long-term

effects in mind we can't possibly know what these things used in products, food and the air will have

as an affect on us. Maybe transpeople are partially a result of something similar. Just as some

people are born with ADHD, without and arm or impaired in someway.

&amp;#x200B;

People in general are not yet used to seeing people in-between genders and feel like there is an

invasion on their territory or afraid that they will end up with someone not being what they seem

like. We just need to get more used to things we didn't previously think existed, but actually did.

It is like the idea of using a phone today talking out into thin air would be ridiculous maybe 50 - 100

years ago. The idea of the technologic advances made today would be ridiculous 20 year ago.

&amp;#x200B;

We are adaptable beings who get used to things. Eventually things will be facts and not about

holding on to a stubborn belief.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't imagine how weird it is for you because someone close to you is ""weird"" for thinking they are

transgender and it previously seemed inconceivable. Instead imagine how hard it must be for that

person having lived a lie and try to convince or be comfortable amongst people who see this

as something opposite as normal. I thank everyone in the transcommunity for staying strong and all

loving humans who accept and love one another no matter etnicity, gender, preferences etc..

&amp;#x200B;

This is just me letting my thoughts out. I have not revised it and hope nothing is formulated in a wrong

way. I will correct anything that may be wrong.

Hello, everyone!

I have never posted here or even on Reddit before so please let me know if my etiquette is off! Also, let me know if any of the terms I used are offensive or outdated as I am super new!

Within the past few months, I have started to think that there is a good possibility I am trans, and I just wanted to reach out to the community to learn from people who have gone through the struggle first hand. 

My experiences so far have been fast, and seemingly out of nowhere. I was talking to my significant other about some experiences in my youth I thought were just normal guy things. When I was young, like 7-15 I would dress up as a girl whenever I was left home alone at school. Along with painting my nails and that kind of thing. I, of course, hid it, because my father is fairly, well Conservative. I was raised to be a real man's man but never really lived up to that because my interest was always in music and writing, along with science and just hanging out with my girlfriends. 

Anyway, after some discussion, we both realized that dressing up as a girl was kind of only the tip of the iceberg, as I recalled planning when I was younger to go out and get breast implants and just simply hide them forever (this was clearly asinine due to being like 10).  

My significant other btw came out to me as essentially transmasculine when we had been dating a while, because he felt as if he was in the wrong body and had done tons of research. So when I brought up the whole I wish I was feminine thing, he had seen this kind of stuff before and started to ask questions and didn’t jump to any conclusions, in fact, any conclusions I have come to at this point have been my own. 

I decided to do some research and have done some thinking and have realized that I may just be trans. I am very indifferent to how I look and behave as a male, and have always enjoyed speech patterns of females and just in general how expressive they are. I honestly have emulated that in my own life unknowingly and have been alienated from most male crowds unless I turn on hyper-masculinity which I don’t really enjoy doing as it’s a chore. I honestly just dress comfortable and have never really had any passion about looks until I tried cross-dressing like a month ago. Now I have found it relieving and I look forward to it almost every day. 

I do have some questions for anyone willing to answer, is it normal for such a sudden realization? Also, I personally have never cared how people have viewed me, as in, people calling me male pronouns just doesn’t bother me. I would rather go by female pronouns in personal life, but in everyday life, I just could not possibly care less. Is that normal or non-dysphoric?

I really appreciate any of those willing to answer some questions, and I would love to get to know the trans community better. This is all so new and honestly scary but exciting to at least confront these old issues. 

Tl;dr

I have suspicions I may be trans, because I have always wanted to behave feminine but due to my upbringing cant. I wonder if its normal for these feelings to pop up so suddenly, and is it irregular to not care about pronouns except with close loved ones? Also, I would love to get to know the community!

I want to show off my body and style of fashion that is far to extravagant for ordinary life.

To paint my face in bright fauvist colours, exploding on my face but somehow remaining harmonious across the colour spectrum. As radiant and elusive as refracted light.  


Complex geometric patterns in lines of a shifting colour spectrum drawn to expose the form of my muscles beneath my skin, drawn to drag eyes along my form. To send viewers into contemplation when looking at my body.  


I want to wear dresses with cleavage cut so low that it shows below my naval. Grace and trickery in my step like Ronaldinho. Stumbling into situations so improbably that I surprise myself by accidentally improvising a perfect solution to intractable problems. Grace spilling from grace, from losing my balance only to find it again in my shifting my center of mass.  


My long tresses woven in more extravagant patterns than mathematicians before the 1970's could imagine, strands of hair falling into self similar looping and weaving geometric forms. Each lock of hair perfectly falling in place, to split to smaller and smaller locks twisting deeper into the nest of my hair.  


Burning my image into the minds of all those who look at me, so they marvel and get lost in my details, unable to understand how something so extravagant can be so cohesive. Eyes caught in the web of my beauty, unable to look away.

Hello,

	We are two transgender girls who just moved from a far away state on a simple promise, that if we got here we would have until January 1st to find a job and get back on our feet. Well, not even a month after we've arrived we're getting thrown to the curb in the middle of November. We both just got jobs but with only one car and one of the jobs having been in walking distance of the place we were staying, we are likely to lose one of them and it's going to put us both into homelessness. We don't have money to get an apartment or efficiency so if we don't get some kind of help soon, we will end up living out of our car.


	We came here to live with my girlfriend's family after being in a very abusive situation with my girlfriends dad for a year, a man who physically assaulted my girlfriend multiple times during that period. Her mom told us that if we came and lived with her that she promised we won't be homeless, said it straight to my girlfriends face after her crying on the couch when we got here over the thought that she might end up being homeless.


 It's a dangerous world, and for two trans girls living on the streets, with the murder and rape numbers for transwomen, neither she nor I feel safe. To kick us more, we're getting thrown out in winter where it get's down to the negatives here, so we'd be lucky to even survive that let alone the potential threat of rape and possibly murder that we would face living on the streets alone to fend for ourselves.


	I'd get it if we were a cis straight couple or even gay couple because they would be able to force themselves to not stand out, but we've both been on hormones for years now and we wouldn't be able to conceal our gender or sexuality very well to protect ourselves if we ended up becoming homeless and forced around people who generally don't take very kindly to people of different genders and sexualities than their own.


	So, we've come here to ask for any help we can get, big or small, to support us and repair a false promise and to ensure our survival in this cruel, cruel world. Thank you so much for reading this, my love goes out to everyone who has a heart to help.",trans,Trans and About to Be Homeless,1542956429.0,"{'created_utc': 1542931229, 'id': '9zjaal', 'num_comments': 37, 'score': 1, 'selftext': ""\nHello,\n\n\tWe are two transgender girls who just moved from a far away state on a simple promise, that if we got here we would have until January 1st to find a job and get back on our feet.

The whole ride we had been talking about science, technology, and politics. We've always had similar world views and beliefs even though we're from a really conservative family and state. We were getting close to his place and the thought of telling him who I really was had been at the back of my mind for the entire trip.

My mouth tasted like metal and my heart was racing. I couldn't think of a good way to say it so I just told him out right ""I'm transgender"" and then proceeded to tell him how I've felt since I was 13, how I've fought myself and hated myself for so long before I came to accept it. I told him how I'd been feeling the pressure to let myself out building and building these last few years, how I felt i would explode if I couldn't be my true self.  

 After I finished, the car was quiet for only a second but it felt like a lifetime, I still didn't know how he'd react but then he said ""I 100% support you, I'm glad you came out to me, because I've been wanting to come out to you, I'm gay."" It's almost funny, both afraid to show our true selves for so long, hiding behind our masks. But here we are opening ourselves up for the first time.

408,2018-11-24 13:25:29,9zyfgx,0,1,"One year ago yesterday was when I finally accepted that I was incredibly unhappy with trying to be a man. With being seen as a man. I had realized I might be trans once before, about 2.5 years ago but I was too scared and talked myself into being ok with being a very feminine dude. I have regretted that ever since. 

One year ago I was lying in bed after a thanksgiving party at our friends house, where I had been told that I couldn't come to the girls night they were organizing. I was lying in of girlfriends arms and just couldn't stop crying. I went back and forth between sobbing uncontrollably and screaming in rage over how unfair it was that I was “born a man”. 

What followed were months and months of agonizing over who I was, over how I could find a way to actually live, to make my life worth living, to be able to love myself and turn my life around. 

I was so incredibly scared. Scared of losing my partner, of losing friends and family, of this not being the right thing for me. I didn't know what to do, where this path would lead me, if I would ever get to a point where I was going to be even remotely comfortable and happy. 

By March I had accepted myself as Laura. As a woman who had every right to exist and to be happy. But even though I experienced incredible support from friends and family and even though my partner was unbelievable supportive (I wouldn't be here today without her), I was still scared. I was still insecure, I still hated my body and was still depressed. 

I am lucky enough to live in a place where my insurance covers all my transition costs and I could get access to HRT without any problems. I have been on HRT for a little over two months, next to the almost immediate benefits to my mental health, I can already see very obvious physical changes that make me so much more confident. 

I just spend a day with my grandparents who are incredibly supportive, my relationship with my partner has never been better, my job allowed me to change my email and ID as soon as I told them, all of my friends and almost all my family has been very supportive, I haven't experienced any kind of aggressive transphobia in the city I live in, basically everyone around me accepts me the way I am. 

I guess there is no real point to my post. Yesterday, when I realized what day it was, I started thinking about all that happened this past year. I am overwhelmed by the love and support, by how lucky I have been and how much happier I am than i ever thought I could be. I wish I could tell my last self all of this, could help her get through this scary and difficult time. 

Since I can't do that, I wanna tell anyone else who needs to hear it. You are valid. You are beautiful and you have every right in the world to make the changes you need to make to be happy. No matter what those are. There will always be people who love you and who will support you. If no one else, there are always people in this beautiful community who will be there for you.

419,2018-11-25 05:57:00,a065g9,1,1,"**If your gender dysphoria is easily triggered be warned** 

Full disclosure, I'm 23 mtf (pre-transition) who truly came out to themselves recently. This was in part due to an experience that I had recently, but I wanna share how I got there.

As a preface I always had the sneaking suspicion that I wasn't really a guy on the inside. 2 or 3 years ago I tossed around the idea maybe I was trans, but because of many other more pressing things going on I suppressed that and just distracted myself with computers and video games.

I used to view certain emotions and sensations as ""bad"" and things that should be avoided. And (partially) as a result I lived my life having very stunted and almost non-existent feeling and emotionality, with only recent months opening up to experiencing *anything*, whether it be something we commonly judge as ""positive"" or ""negative"".

A wise person once told me that it's perfectly okay to feel. To ""be fully present in your body and in this moment"". I intellectually knew this but I never truly practiced it and implemented it. That is, until this most recent Thanksgiving. Before this my focus in life was on very different things, and the idea of being trans wasn't even anywhere on it (at least not consciously).

I was sitting in my mom's car being driven to a dinner we were going to, and I decided to just put my headphones down, stop listening to music, and just sit there. I took deep breaths and just allowed myself to observe whatever was going on internally and externally. More specifically, I decided to do this while feeling like I was fully *in* my body rather just in my head like normal.

In just moments I was feeling true gender dysphoria for the first time. I felt how my penis truly felt like some weird additional appendage that shouldn't have been there. Later on I had a moment when I really felt the testosterone in my bloodstream, and the dysphoria was getting pretty intense. And now even as I type this I occasionally feel like breasts both are and aren't there (phantom breasts you could say). Most trans folk I imagine would call this suffering, but I'm actually extremely grateful for this feeling. Because it's actually a feeling that truly and fully felt with my entire being. I fully embrace it if it ever comes up.

After my initial experience of dysphoria subsided, I was (and still am) excited because I know now without a doubt. Everything is clicking into place. To really feel something with your entire being is something truly special, and something I haven't really experienced in this life until now. Sure I'd occasionally feel some type of emotion or sensation, but it never truly *came out* if that makes sense. This does, and I have this knowing that if I do begin to transition other emotions of mine will follow.

I know there will be a lot of challenges ahead, and my dysphoria comes and goes with varying intensity. But I'm actually really eager to face this, and I'd like to share some of that positivity with you all. I hope that no matter where anyone is in their journey, they will feel at least a little fired up to face whatever it is they are facing.

I’ll explain. 

I have gender dysphoria.
Not a lot, not enough to be my main worry, but enough to make me wonder about transitioning, and how that would work for me. Thing is I don’t know that it would?

I don’t hate my tits, so I wouldn’t want top surgery.

Presenting as female is something mostly neutral, just tinged with negative dysphoria for me. I really like girls, so I suppose I can appreciate my body from that perspective?

I asked could this be me?! But that wave ended quickly and I went back to being 'normal'.  A couple years later, I can remember asking in front of my Mother and Brother, ""I wonder what it's like to be a girl"". Quick and witty, mom replied with sarcasm ""you could wear panties and a bra and find out"", I was kind of embarrassed and it shut me down...

Over the next few years, more waves crashed over me, up until I was 18, I got into cross dressing in secret, well hidden, only when I knew I was home alone for fear of being discovered.  Finally 18, out of the house and in college.  over the next four years I got my first serious girlfriend, we got an appartment together, I dressed occasionally when the waves hit, Senior year we get engaged and finally graduated...

We moved into a house and a year later the biggest wave yet crashed over me, I tried her makeup for the first time and felt peace... but with this peace, in the wave as I drown, I reveled to myself who I was and what I had been denying.  I came out for the first time, that I think I'm Trans... To her... and she said that I needed space to figure things out. She walked out the door and the last 5 years, and this huge wave, were over...

Now Alone, I finally Land a great job using my degree and bury myself in work, trying to avoid what blew a hole in my life.  Over the next two years I ignore the waves, learn to swim, get another Girlfriend, get Serious, get engaged and start planning...

468,2018-11-27 06:55:45,a0sf9p,5,1,"(Sorry for the wall of text, TL;DR at the end if you don't like reading long posts)

A little over half a year ago, after six long years of struggling and internally debating, I came out as a transgender woman; and about six years ago, I started questioning the very world I lived in. If I'm being honest, I didn't think I'd live this long. And holy hell, I'm not living, *I'm thriving!*

I'm not just waking up and hating myself anymore! I'm making things! I'm creating! I'm making friendships and relationship, I'm excited for the future! I made it to 18 fucking years, and I am so happy! *I MADE IT!*

I'm so happy to celebrate this occasion; not as the angry, fearful boy I used to be, but the happy girl I was meant to be. 

I envisioned my whole family being here with me, but that, sadly, is not going to happy. For the first time since I was probably born, my grandparents are not invited to my birthday party. They were like a second set of parents for me, and they've been there with my family and I every single step of the way. I still love them, to say the least. 

But after I came out, they responded to my letter to them with a letter of their own. Mine was peaceful and cordial, and I wrote it solely because I was too nervous to speak and I knew they would need some help understanding me. I soon got a letter back, which I've thrown out, because it infuriates me.

Among other things in the five-page letter they wrote back (too be fair, mine was just a long, but I didn't even bother reading past page two.), they said **""a man cannot be a woman, and a woman cannot be a man, as decreed by God""**, and that the reason I'm feeling this way (seemingly my entire life) is because **""the devil is whispering in my ear""**.

I'm not paraphrasing. I'm not summarizing. Those are their *exact* words.

Those words make me want to punch a hole in the fucking wall (and this exchange happened a month or two ago)! I remembered how worried they were when I used to be extremely depressed, or I wouldn't come out of my rooms for a day or two. They always said they'd support me, as they just wanted me to be happy. Lo and behold, I'm having the time of my life, as I'm finally starting to be comfortable with myself. And they abandoned me like trash. I guess I've expired my usefulness.

I don't know what to feel. I have a million emotions flying through my head at the moment and its 00:49. I'm sad I had to lose them over something like this, but I'm also pissed off that I resort to this just so I don't feel like a freak. I still haven't told them, but I don't know how I'm going to tell them that they're not welcome in the very house the helped build. That's all I can do really, I guess. Only one of us can change, and I sure as hell can't.

I can't even remember if I've ever been truely happy and recently I started to wonder if that might be because I never had the chance to really embrace both sides of my personality.

Now to be clear, I don't have the urge to transition and become a female, I'm fine with my male body. If I could switch from a male to female body I'd defo do that but it's not an option and as I've said I'm fine being physically male. I have never had the urge to dress up or put make up on either, or appear more feminine in general - maybe because I never really had the chance to. I'd totally love being dressed up and made pretty by other girls though and go out with them.

I don't switch genderds intentionally, I don't identify as a male and another time as a female. I'm kinda always both with one side coming out in certain situations and the other pulling itself back and vise versa. I've read through the internet and couldn't find anything on this, everything I read involves actively switching genders, physical appearance, being addressed and recognized as the current gender - but I don't care about all of those. I'm just a grown ass man and a girl sharing the same body and mind, switching places at random, sometimes merging.

475,2018-11-27 16:26:17,a0wddx,0,1,"Hey all!

I just listened to one of my favourite albums, by one of my favourite bands today, and I started to see one particular song, Lose This Skin, with vocals by Tyomon Dogg, in a new light. Regardless of the original intention of the song, I started thinking, damn, this could really be a trans/intersex/genderqueer theme song.  
And, I just wanted to share the new experience I had with this song.

[Here's the song, with lyrics in the description.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtWdVX6LS8w)   
So, I wanna go through the lyrics, with commentary on how I just experienced the song.

*First verse*
&gt; Come with me. I won't hide

""Won't hide"" = I'm coming out. ""Come with me"" = Let's do it together, as in, do it with me, so we stand together - basically following Harvey Milk's idea of how we can normalise trans* people and build tolerance.

&gt; We're going on a ride

Moving from one thing to another - the personal experience of transformation.

&gt; We meet each day, use time to see

Stand together, let's support each other.

&gt; While we're young and almost free

Don't keep postponing your transformation, nor the work to change society towards tolerance and acceptance. We're not *quite* free from our self internalised denial/self-loathing, etc., nor the discriminatrion and hate we face from society at large.

*Chorus*

&gt; I've got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in
&gt; Got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in

I need to change - ""this skin"" is the body/gender I was born into, but it's a prison, I can't realise myself in it.

*Second verse*

&gt; Do not turn our head to see

&gt; All the things you think we've got

&gt; Do not turn or hate to see

&gt; What happened to the wife of Lot

Most lyrics on the internet say it's ""turn or hate to see"", but that doesn't make sense, unless it's a play on words, when you consider the parallel to the wife of Lot below.  
Anyway, again, this is a parallel to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where God says they're not to look back when they flee, or they'll be turned to pillars of salt. Lot's wife does it anyway, and does indeed turn to salt. Anyway, I think this could mean that we shouldn't grow complacent towards change - we still have a road ahead.

*Chorus

*Third verse*

&gt; We're alone or so they say

We're told that we're freaks, this is not normal. We're pariahs, not conforming to expected standards of gender.

&gt; We're not on our own in that way

But he's saying, that's not true. We've got each other, and we've got allies.

&gt; When we're alone it's real tough going

But it's really fucking rough when you feel like you're alone. When you feel like you're a freak for experiencing dysphoria - especially the case for a lot of young people that are not familiar with the fact that they're not alone in their experience.

&gt; We can take a part in someone else's play

But we *can* be there together, support and reassure each other.

*Chorus*

*Fourth verse*

&gt; Come with me, I thought he said

I'm not sure - this sounds like he/she thought they had a friend and an ally. But it turns out they ended up shunning them. I'm not sure, though, when you consider the rest of the verse.

&gt; But that's not him anymore, he's dead

They're not who I thought they were. I've cut ties, because I don't deserve their hate.  
Alternately, though I don't know how this would relate to the previous part of the verse: it could be another trans* who's ""died"" and ""reborn"". They've transformed from their old self, to become their true selves.

&gt; What's it like to be so free

How does it feel to finally be free from that hate? Or, alternately, how does it feel to finally have gone through that transformation, and finally, physically, be your real self.

&gt; So free it looks like lost to me

How does it feel to be free from the cage that was the hate of their ""friend"", or free from the dysphoria of feeling trapped in a body that's not yours.

---

Well, this might not be the original intention of what the song is supposed to be about. It could also be about other ways of feeling alone and shunned, or a host of other things. Though, as I recall, Joe Strummer *did* have an intersex friend and mentor in the 70's. I believe I read that, but now I can't find any sources confirming that.  
In any case, when it comes to art, while it's interesting to ponder the intent of the piece, your own experience and interpretation is just as valid. ""We Are Family"" is the first thing that comes to mind - it wasn't meant to be a queer anthem, but it's now been co-opted, the original artists, Sister Sledge, they've embraced that. I think that has value too.

I guess I should say that I'm not trans* myself, though I am queer, and a big trans* ally. When I use ""I"" or ""we"" in the commentary, it's from the narrator's perspective. I won't pretend to understand your experience completely, but I can emphasise, and try to support my transgender friends as best I can. Anyway, like I said, I haven't experienced your going through what you're going through, and I apologise if I've said anything that might be offensive, or misunderstood something. I *can* say that it's all in good faith, though. :)

Well, a bit of a long winded wall of text, all this, but it was nice for me to put down in writing, and sharing - and if any of this makes sense to someone else, all the better. :)

Again, I will not have insurance or any ways to get it. So people with similar experience would be preferred, but its not a have to.

How much was the endo for you guys? How many visits? I know its different for each person, but I can at least get an idea on how much it could cost me. 

How much blood work did you need and how much did it all cost?

How much was testosterone with no insurance? What about the needles?

532,2018-11-30 08:03:07,a1qio5,20,1,"Hello. I am a 35 year old male and last month or two I have been struggling with the question above. I have been fantasizing about what it would be like as a female for around 20 years, but always believed it was nothing more that that. I have asked myself the trans question over those 20 years a lot and my answer (until recently) was always no. But (I think) mainly because I didn't want to be a transwoman. Mainly because of my believe that transwomen could never 100% pass (forgive my ignorance here please). And because becoming an actual natural women was not an option I always left it at that. However I have been looking at /r/transtimelines lately and I feel it has changed my mind on the transwoman option a little. So I have been thinking some more about it and here are my (conflicting) conclusions, so I hoped the lovely people in this subreddit could provide some objective advice.

**Why I think I am trans:**

* If I had a button that would permanently transform me into a natural female, would I press it? Yes
* I have been ""into"" gender transformation art (like [tgcomics.com](https://tgcomics.com)) for over 10 years now
* I am mesmerized by the female filter of FaceApp on the phone. It has created tons of cute female versions of myself
* 95% of my sexual fantasies are about me being or transforming into a woman.
* I envy woman I see in public if they have long hair or are wearing leggings, skinny jeans or a dress. Women have so much more options in clothing it's not even funny.
* If I have the option to play as a female in any kind of game (or d&amp;d), I do. And not ""so I can look at a female body all day"" or whatever that excuse is.

**Why I think I am not trans:**

* I am living a happy life. I have a wife and a son whom I love dearly.
* If I look in the mirror I don't feel anything negative, more like boredom or indifference.
* I have a male mind with male mannerisms. I have studied (as in, read a few books on the subject, not created an actual thesis) the psychological differences between men and women and I definitely fit in the male category.
* I feel way more ""at home"" in a group of men than in a group of women.
* I can see myself living a happy life and growing old as a man. There are enough things in the world that make me happy. 

As you can see I am a bit conflicted on the subject. Maybe I am trans but have learned to live with it? Maybe it's that simple?

What I also think is interesting is I have a pretty good sense of identity. I know and love who I am as a person. However being male is not a part of that. Masculinity is not a part of my identity. You could take my ""manhood"" (literally and figuratively) away from me and that would not hurt my identity at all. Maybe this is the solution my brain has come up with to handle my gender dysphoria in my teens? I don't know.

538,2018-11-30 21:49:56,a1wuub,13,1,"Hey everyone, today I have finally accepted the truth about myself. I am a trans female. I have been fighting this for over a year now, and I have constantly tried to justify to myself that it was just a phase, or I’m gay, or bi, and I keep coming back to the same realization every time. I’m transgender. 

My family knows about me being trans, but they have insisted that it was just a phase. I’m tired of hiding behind the fears of what people will think of me, and I’m ready to start a new chapter of my life. I have been dragging out my old life for far too long, pretending to be someone I’m not. 

My work situation does not permit me to present as a female, so for right now this is something I will have to deal with. My work also does not have insurance, so HRT will be something I will have to wait for in the future. 

I am at absolute peace with life and my entire situation. I have been fighting the reality of my situation for so long, I have pushed close friends away and started to become a hermit. But today that ends.

I'm mainly posting this to see where other people stand on this. I'm not ACTUALLY inferring that genderfluid people (nor any other NB or GQ identity) are automatically sexually fluidity, but just a general discussion.

Now before I started discovering myself as a genderqueer person, I found myself ID-ing as a gay man, and seeing myself as only attracted to men (eventually also including trans men, which for some reason I didn't factor before). What I've tended to find so far is that, maybe not so much actively finding more people of different genders attractive (because I would be a hypocrite if I said I wouldn't date another GQ person), but when I do see an active attraction to something outside of MY norm (I'm mainly attracted to men, cis trans or, unfortunately, assumed) I don't find myself necessarily defending it as much, or being as rigid in my definitions. Now I suppose it makes sense really, considering not belonging to a binary gender can sort of muddy the gay-straight binary as well (and lets not forget bi folx), but I noticed that I was somewhat more liberated and comfortable, even tho when I initially started ID-ing as GQ it sort of felt like I went into the wilderness again.

So I came out as genderqueer a few years back, really felt dysphoric about my chest, went on T for about 8 months (that's what my therapist required for her to give me approval for top surgery), hated the effect T had on my voice (why I stopped), finally got top surgery, and am now feeling genuinely euphoric about my body (apart from my voice, because people constantly mistake me for a guy).

19,2018-11-04 09:50:03,9u28xh,20,1,"Hey all, first time poster.

  So I've been grappling with the feeling that I present too ""binary"" to ID as genderqueer and to use they/them pronouns.  I would never have these thoughts about others in the same situation but for some reason I'm criticizing myself over it.

  I'm AFAB and have been on T for 4 years, have had top surgery, hysto and stage 1 phallo, and I still absolutely ID as transmasculine genderqueer and strictly use they/them pronouns (other than at work because I'd like to keep my job). But I feel like I'm too ""ftm seeming"" to get to use they/them pronouns.  When I have to have he/him used at work it just feels so wrong and makes me feel disconnected and like I'm not even being talked to.  They/them pronouns are the only ones that feel right and have ever felt right, and I don't consider myself a man.

  I know there's no wrong way to be nonbinary but I'm just feeling anxious about presenting so masculinely and being happy with that yet still in my heart knowing I'm genderqueer.  When people have asked me how I know I'm genderqueer and not a man then I just don't know how to answer.  Because to me it's just, I know what I am, there's no attached explanations in my mind and I can't figure out how to explain how I know.  I'm just comfortable with being genderqueer.  

  Anyone have any insight or opinions to share on this?  Don't know whether I should just not be bothered by people asking that question because I feel what I am or if I should ask myself if maybe they're right and I'm somehow in denial of being male?

24,2018-11-05 17:59:28,9ufttx,3,1,"One of the more frustrating parts of being queer is that we're all representatives of the culture (whether we want that or not). I'm not the friend who happens to be queer, I'm the queer friend -- or the trans, bi, whatever. I'm the label first and the person second. On one hand it's nice people finally have a script to go off of, so there's fewer blank or surprised reactions coming out. On the other, well -- everyone's got an opinion now. Which is fine except for that ambassador bit I mentioned. Now I'm like the Queer Pope, and I must bless it now.


""Holy Pronoun, Who Art Thou In ... *whatever.*"" Here's the thing -- it seems obvious to say someone doesn't have to be queer to support LGBTQ rights. For some reason though, in the rush to be politically correct the message got marked return to sender; They're not *queer* rights, they're everybody's. 


Just because I'm in the culture doesn't mean I somehow feel slighted because someone decides to go out in drag on a dare, or because they think it's funny. It's okay to joke about your gender being an ""attack helicopter"". I mean, who hasn't had a passing attraction to military hardware? It would solve many otherwise socially awkward moments with coworkers. Pew. Pew. 


One of (many) unfortunate things to come out of the disreputable institution of Political Correctness is the idea that a person's identity can't be mix and match. Take a little from this culture, a little from that, and make it their own. That's at the core of what freedom of expression and individuality is, and it's under siege now with the misguided idea that it's wrong to ""appropriate"". No, it's completely appropriate to appropriate -- that's the thing about culture. I don't lose my identity because someone saw something about me and said ""Oh hey, that's cool. I'm going to do that now too!"" Culture is meant to be shared. Saying only certain people can do certain things is what created this whole mess. 


But back to being Pope. Political Correctness has made all of us in the life part Pope. We can't just go to church, as it were, we have to stand on ceremony. We have to bless others' opinions about the culture, hand out instructional materials on how to properly read The Script(ure), and others (for reasons beyond me) expect some kind of divine retribution when an ever-shifting myriad of invisible boundaries get stepped over by wayward sheep. 


Thing is, this approach actually sucks. I know everyone had a different childhood but there are a *few* common experiences, and one of those was adults trying to make everyone play nice. So if someone got excluded, Helpful Adult #395 (""I'm Helping!"") would push the kid back into the group, tell everyone to play nice and try to guilt and shame them with a ""Well how would *you* like it?"" And ya know something? That kid was hated for it. And once the helpful adult, satisfied at having gained some karma for doing good, had left... things were usually worse than if they'd just left it alone. Now we're all adults and somehow we forgot that childhood lesson. We can't be better than we are.


That's often how I feel with all these attempts people make at being 'inclusive'; Things like starting social gatherings with people going around the room and giving their name, preferred pronouns, etc., and whenever someone gets the pronouns wrong there's almost a dog pile on the poor bastard who did. I don't feel great seeing that, or hearing about it. And I hear about it -- I can't *not* hear about it, because people want me, the Queer Pope, to know they did the Right Thing that time. Well, as Queer Pope, I guess here's what my sermon is;


&gt; You're going to fuck this up. You'll use the wrong name, wrong pronouns, and yeah it's gonna sting. But here's the thing about that: Are you trying? Ok, then we're cool. Hey, I get being uncomfortable and confused -- I call that Tuesday in Popeville. You have my permission to get it wrong, and not feel bad when it happens. Because it will. Probably often, at least for awhile. 



&gt; You don't have to be a queen to like drag music. You can have a rainbow handbag and still be straight. We have a unique cultural identity which isn't harmed when people borrow from it. I look at it like lending friends my favored hoodie or top -- just wash it when you bring it back. It's okay to borrow. 


&gt; What's not okay is to make yourself a caricature. Don't be an ass about it. That's it. And don't worry about getting it wrong; Even if you offend someone, a sincere apology is all that's required. I often feel like we, as a society, have run afoul of common courtesy and decency in our rush to elevate it. I don't like people looking down on others or calling them backwards because they struggle with this. 


&gt; I struggled with it! I drove the goddamned struggle bus through the middle of Struggletown, in reverse, during a category five shit storm. I get it. And I forgive anyone who is; I won't judge someone poorly because they keep screwing up. I wish this were easy. For everyone, myself included. But it's not, and I'm not going to belittle or marginalize anyone by acting like it is. Tolerance has to go both ways.


And that's it. It seems like such an obvious thing to say that I shouldn't have to say it. I actually wish I didn't have to keep having this conversation over and over again, and that I lived in a world where people didn't feel like they're walking on egg shells around me over The Pronoun Question. It's not really a step up from where I was before Le Revolution -- which was telling people and then having them trip over themselves trying to disassociate sex and gender. I'm still just as uncomfortable. 


All I (or anyone) can ask is to try and understand, and respect my choices. Not just about my pronouns, but life in general. There's a million little things about all of us that shouldn't have to be explained or justified. All I really want, is for this to be one of those things too. There doesn't have to be a reason besides that I asked. And it shouldn't be a big deal when mistakes are made -- it's what comes after that matters. 


In the end, in all the ways we relate to each other, we let each other down. The ones we hurt the most are the ones we're closest to. What matters isn't when it happens, but what we do after to make it better. So to all my Pope friends... forgive, and grow. And give others permission to do the same, because it's something that isn't heard enough. This is how we worship a world we try so hard to love. Our minds and bodies are often confusing but our love doesn't have to be -- for ourselves *or* each other.

25,2018-11-06 12:32:06,9unwmj,1,1,"Is it bad for someone like me to be taking testosterone when I've only got a moderate amount of dysphoria? 

My dysphoria stems from feeling uncomfortable and out of place being a woman. It stems from feeling happier with a flat chest and smaller thighs. It stems from feeling more complete with a low voice because my feminine voice makes me feel uncomfortable and crushes my self-esteem. 

I was masculine to begin with, it was my voice that gave me away the most, and the idea that my chest would only continue to develop without top surgery makes me upset. I feel like these are what needs to be changed in order to improve my life for the better. 

I don't like the mental changes on testosterone, believe me, I've been on hormones for 3 months and only just got back onto the minimum dose after the last 3 weeks off being off them. It got to the point where I felt detached from my surroundings. I no longer enjoyed things that I did beforehand, such as focusing on my appearance. I consider myself a bit of a poser. I enjoy dying my hair and dressing in strange clothes. I'm talking going outside in a jabot blouse and top hat. But on the hormones, whether placebo or not, I didn't feel comfortable doing so. 

Wait... comfortable... does this mean being on hormones increased my dysphoria? Oh jeez, there's no telling anymore. My head has always been wishy-washy in one way or another, and I've often feared someone may point this out to me eventually. It's sure strange though, since I love what testosterone has done with my shoulders and the excess hair has been great. Where exactly is this all coming from?

Maybe it's the idea that there isn't much to be altered when it comes to my transition. Unlike those who are binary trans, I have a lot less mental agony to deal with. I fully acknowledge the desperation some may have to begin hormones. I understand that in many cases it's a life or death situation. And because if I have little dysphoria and won't be taking hormones full term... well... what kind of freak does this make me? I could probably be lumped in just fine with those ""trenders"" people go on about, whether real or not, I feel that as a result people would just think I'm doing this for some cosmetic rush. 

I do, however, wonder whether my dysphoria would've been more prominent if I weren't naturally androgynous. Not to rub it in. I'm just saying that if I wasn't naturally hairy and had a larger chest... maybe it would be different. Which is probably why it stumped the Hell out of that lady I spoke with on the phone the other week. She worked for part of a transgender hotline, and being trans herself she got quite upset over the fact I was starting hormones but wasn't 100% stuck on how uncomfortable my body made me. In her case, she expected me to feel much more anxiety over the way I looked. (Hotline was mainly there for sharing thoughts and feelings about transitioning/life in general. A support line). 

I also wonder how much it would affect me to place myself on hormones just to see what happens. Is it okay to do this to myself? I mean, there's no other way I'm going to get answers. And the gender clinic refuses to perform top surgery unless I've been on hormones for 6 - 10 months. 

Is there much harm in starting and stopping? I've been on 3 months. I've stopped for just under a month. And it might only take me another 3/4 months to get the changes I've needed. 

I just hope no stupid stuff happens in between. I'm great at freaking out and taking stuff to the extreme.

A few more changes I couldn't handle was the inability to cry, the loss of connection to my personality, and the genuine feeling that I was turning into somebody I was not (mentally).

It stems from feeling happier with a flat chest and smaller thighs. It stems from feeling more complete with a low voice because my feminine voice makes me feel uncomfortable and crushes my self-esteem. \n\nI was masculine to begin with, it was my voice that gave me away the most, and the idea that my chest would only continue to develop without top surgery makes me upset. I feel like these are what needs to be changed in order to improve my life for the better. \n\nI don\'t like the mental changes on testosterone, believe me, I\'ve been on hormones for 3 months and only just got back onto the minimum dose after the last 3 weeks off being off them. It got to the point where I felt detached from my surroundings. I no longer enjoyed things that I did beforehand, such as focusing on my appearance. I consider myself a bit of a poser. I enjoy dying my hair and dressing in strange clothes. I\'m talking going outside in a jabot blouse and top hat. But on the hormones, whether placebo or not, I didn\'t feel comfortable doing so. \n\nWait... comfortable... does this mean being on hormones increased my dysphoria? Oh jeez, there\'s no telling anymore. My head has always been wishy-washy in one way or another, and I\'ve often feared someone may point this out to me eventually. It\'s sure strange though, since I love what testosterone has done with my shoulders and the excess hair has been great. Where exactly is this all coming from?\n\nMaybe it\'s the idea that there isn\'t much to be altered when it comes to my transition. Unlike those who are binary trans, I have a lot less mental agony to deal with. I fully acknowledge the desperation some may have to begin hormones. I understand that in many cases it\'s a life or death situation. And because if I have little dysphoria and won\'t be taking hormones full term... well... what kind of freak does this make me? I could probably be lumped in just fine with those ""trenders"" people go on about, whether real or not, I feel that as a result people would just think I\'m doing this for some cosmetic rush. \n\nI do, however, wonder whether my dysphoria would\'ve been more prominent if I weren\'t naturally androgynous.

I've always considered myself cis-female and actually experience a little body dysphoria over my slight facial hirsutism. My features are also a bit more andro than I would like and I get really hurt when people say I look masculine. Pronoun preference is strongly she/her.

Outside of this though I often feel like I'm being assumed as fitting a certain social role that is wrong. With the one exception of pronouns - when it comes to how people treat me and the assumptions they make around social interactions I just really wish gender wasn't even a thing. In terms of behavior and preferences I'm just me, I like some traditionally masculine things and some traditionally feminine things - I react in the way I react and I don't consider it masculine or feminine. I get twitchy when guys assume they should watch their language around me or people question how I manage working in a male dominated environment. I get downright grumpy when I'm excluded from activities that I am interested in because those taking part want it to be just man-time, and I often feel uncomfortable taking part in girl-time because a lot of those activities involve stuff I just have no interest in. I thought this was just normal discomfort with societal pressures but it happens so often and it really is a case of ""could you just ignore my gender for a second here"" that I'm now questioning that.

It's best summarized I guess as gender to me is the state of my physical identity, and has nothing to do with my personality or preferences, but it's also how I want to be seen (for example around my male friends I want to be seen, not as the ""cool girl"", closer to ""one of the guys"", but really just ""one of us"" without any reference to gender at all).

47,2018-11-10 08:58:05,9vsx82,9,1,"Hi all! I'm new here. 

Some time ago I bought a binder from gc2b. It was a full tank-length style binder, and I liked it fine, except that when I sat while wearing it, the compression panel came down low enough that it cut into my tummy and made me look like I had the muffin top from hell. I later learned this is because the full-length tank styles were meant for people with more abundant breast tissue, which absolutely does not describe me. 

So recently I bought two more binders, in the half-length style. I like them quite a bit, the size is good, and for the most part, they're comfy. The problem is that now the bottoms roll/bunch up a lot, and at the end of a work day I've got bunched up material kind of digging into me, right around where the bottom bra band would sit. 

Turns out I've got a pretty short torso, all things considered; on top of that I'm very pear-shaped and that A-line flare (for lack of a better term) starts pretty high up. Is there anything I can do to help prevent binders from rolling or bunching up like this? I feel confident it's not that there's anything wrong with the manufacture, I just have a wildly incompatible torso shape for binding, and am just looking for whatever options I can find to compensate for that.

I am 22 years old, bisexual, and was born a male. When I was younger (elementary school and on) I would constantly fantasize about wearing women’s clothing (even trying them on), doing my makeup, nails, etc. especially before bed.

I was AMAB and have only very recently (after about 8 years of questioning both my sexuality and Gender Identity) realised that I define myself as Genderqueer. To me, my Genderqueer identity is a mixture of not having a strong feeling of belonging to any Gender, wanting to live my daily life as androgynous (or slighty more feminine), whilst also knowing that in different occasions I prefer to highlight my masculine personality/traits (not that I have  particularly strong ones) and at other points really live up to traditional feminine stereotypes. For the most part this expression of my Genderqueer identity I expect to show through clothes and make-up etc... however, I have recently started questioning if I have any feelings of Dysphoria.

&amp;#x200B;

My Genderqueer journey began with 'cross dressing' at the age of 13 in private (im now 21) - I never felt like I wasn't a man (then again I never felt like I was I just beleived the societal idea that having a penis at birth makes you a man) and originally I thought 'cross dressing' was part of my Queer sexuality. I certainly never felt like I had Dysphoria. That was until I started talking to some of my fellow LGBTQ+ freinds and they said some of the stuff I had been feeling may well come under Genderqueer Dysphoria. So My questios here is, how can I go about altering the elements of my body/personality that I dont like to further live comfortably as a Genderqueer person?

&amp;#x200B;

Facial Hair: I hate it, always have on me, even from well before I was questioning my Gender. I shave everyday but I still have a shadow - any advice on this?

Physique: I am quite tall and thin, 6'3 infact. I have never really liked my body (though I much prefer it now that I have shaved in a more stereotypically way. I am looking at buying some kind of underbust corset to give myself a more feminine looking body - is there any recamendations? Equally I would like to, on some occasions, make it look as if I have breasts (nothing large, maybe B cup) - is there anyway to achieve this? For the most part I dont like being so flat chested but sometimes I do so I dont think surgery would be a good option?

Face Structure: I never really liked the structre of my face, are there any good ways to make it look more adrogynous/feminine?

&amp;#x200B;

Sexual Organs: I dont have a problem with these per say, its just on occasions where I would like to feel more feminie I find myself not liking how they look when I wear feminine underwear - is there any advice on this?

Sorry in advance as this is probably gonna be ramble-y...I haven’t slept and my thoughts are super jumbled and I’m nervous talking about this. For some background info, I’m a 24 afab person who usually identifies as agender. I guess I’m asking for advice if anyone has some, as well as ranting a bit?

Tl;dr: not sure how to deal with bottom dysphoria as an afab non-binary who is questioning whether they may actually be ftm. Really confused and not sure where to go from here to help the dysphoria/identity confusion.

I have social dysphoria around my name and pronouns, but it’s manageable. I’m usually fine with presenting femme and I’m fine with my curves. Chest dysphoria hits pretty hard once in a while, but I can usually kinda deal with it okay.

What’s killing me is bottom dysphoria. It’s...bad. It’s affecting my relationship and my depression has taken me to a new low. It just feels so, so wrong; it makes me squeamish to think about and any sort of contact (sexual or otherwise) with any part of it fills me with a sense of dread. I’m not sure what I can do. I think I’d be happiest with nothing down there, but the thought of having a different set of genitals seems totally okay with me.

Also, I’ve recently begun questioning whether I’m agender or ftm. I know I would’ve been much happier born as a cis male (I think about this a lot), and from a young age I’ve felt very awkward in my body (I still do) and always considered myself more masculine. It was drilled into my head as a kid that being masculine as a girl is bad, so I’ve been dressing super femme most of my life, and I feel like I’m compensating for something. I haven’t tried masc to see how I feel because I feel like I have a mental block about it/I’m scared/my chest is really hard to hide.

It seems sometimes like they come out of the closet only to walk into a bigger one. Years ago when I had a therapist I was encouraged to go to group therapy. That was a mistake. 


Seeing other people like me was fucking terrifying. Whether they'd had surgery or not, passed or not, they all had pretty serious issues going on, whether it was drugs, depression, abuse -- there weren't really any success stories in the room. I quit not long after. I've tried connecting with people in the community since, in a less medical setting, but I've still never felt comfortable. I actually just gave up on therapy, because I'd run into therapists that would tell me that maybe I'm just gay (I'm not...), or encourage me to wear dresses and makeup more in public (I can, I do) -- and made me feel like just wanting to wear jeans and a t-shirt and pass was either unattainable or wrong-headed somehow. I felt like I'd escaped one set of stereotypes, only to have a new set crammed down my throat. Can't I just be like my friends, who aren't obsessed with shoes, dresses, and makeup and define themselves by their social circles instead of how they look? I guessed not.


It's like being around others like me just amplifies my own self-esteem and image problems to the point of being physically painful and exhausting. It's hard for me to even watch Youtube 'howto' videos and those people look a lot happier and adjusted. I just can't sit through it for more than a couple minutes before I have to turn it off. 


It's frustrating that I can't push away my own feelings and actually connect with the community. Every time I push myself though, it's holding a mirror up and it's really hard to shut down comparing myself to them. It's not a game, or a competition -- rationally I know everyone has different challenges and it's just my own discomfort with myself that's getting in the way. I still beat myself up though for not even being able to watch a video, in my own room, about something that defines a big part of who I am and is part of my life. I'm also a gamer -- I can watch hours of streams of people who fit every bad stereotype there (poor hygiene, social skills, etc.) and it doesn't bother me. This shouldn't be any different, and yet it is.


As great as I am comforting friends and others in the community, when it comes to myself I'm completely lost. I'm almost 40 now -- I still feel like I'm on the starting blocks, and there's nobody in the community I can relate to. I often wonder if I'm really even part of it.

I am a cis-gender woman. I have been dating a genderqueer man for the last few months. We are both poly and married and each have one other long-term partner. We are both mostly straight (as in he is attracted to feminine-presenting women and I am usually attracted to men).

I will be honest, I am pretty freakin’ smitten with him. He’s so confident and sexy and I love helping him pick out clothes and jewelry. He’s way better looking than I am, and in better shape. The sex is amazing. 

But I am sad and thinking I need to end things with him because he just doesn’t seem all that into me...he seems kind of like he could take me or leave me, tbh. 

I try to boost my self esteem by saying, “well clearly he must like me because he is way better looking than I am and so he would have lots of other options if he wanted someone else...” but then I get a sinking feeling that he *doesn’t* have as many options as other men of similar attractiveness ....because if finding dates as a polyamorous married man is tough as it is, dating as a polyamorous married genderqueer man is probably even tougher. 

It’s almost to the point where I worry that if I tell him that I am sensing that he isn’t interested, he will tell me that he is more interested than he is just so that he can keep having sex with me. Maybe I am just being insecure and paranoid....

I guess what I am wondering is, is dating as a genderqueer person really all that much harder than dating as a gender-conforming person?

While this post deals mainly with issues of trans masculine nonbinary dysphoria, of course trans feminine and binary people offering support or ideas is more than welcome.


I'd also like to apologize in advance if I don't make much sense. I hav lots of trouble describing particular aspects of my dysphoria so I use metaphors a lot. I'm also really really struggling. 


~ ~ ~ ~ ~  ~


Ok so I'm here today because I'm really struggling with dysphoria and depression. So my situation is I am an afab genderfluid person with severe fluctuating dysphoria.


I'm just gonna describe my dysphoria a bit before moving on. So some days I am fine with no dysphoria, other days I have intense dysphoria and still some days I fall in between. Generally my dysphoria switches in larger.... Chunks of time? It's not a daily thing but more biweekly maybe, and it tends to be like an underlying dysphoria with really bad spurts. Think of like a low humming sound that sometimes increases in volume momentarily. I get dysphoria about everything from my chest to my jawline. I have ""phantom dick"" syndrome. I also get this really weird feeling when dysphoria suddenly intensifies.... It's like something inside of me is bursting through my core? Like imagine a spirit leaving your body (without the death). It feels like how one may imagine that would feel. Not corporal, but still there.  Sometimes my dysphoria leaves me nauseous, etc etc.



You may be saying well it sounds like testosterone is for you! However as a genderfluid person I am putting emphasis on dysphoric *fluctuations*. It follows that if I were to go on t, I'd have girl days still, and would therefore have a sort of reverse dysphoria. That's one issue with that. This leads into the next issue, which is of course I am still feminine as well so being on t and dressing and appearing feminine may be dangerous in some situations and I am afraid of being harmed.


This leads into my issues surrounding hate and bigotry. People barely get binary trans people, not to mention us nonbinary folks. Transphobia in general hurts and scares me. Then there is the nonbinary specific Transphobia which I have to deal with as well, from both within and outside of the trans community. The hate is present and seems to be growing. It's taking a big toll on me. I'm technically out, but I'm scared of being visible in any way. Right now I appear like a masculine girl I suppose, so I haven't had to say much about my gender outside of my small social circle. All of this, the dysphoria and the hate, has led me to despair


I will never be able to live my truth. Hatred is everywhere. Dysphoria is atypical and I can't deal with it anymore. I am tired of being viewed as a joke and I'm tired of feeling I will never be free of dysphoria. I am worried. I have found over the last two years that I'm experiencing something that may be some kind of dissociation : periodically it feels as if I am not in the physical world, that nothing is real. It randomly feels like my clothes go missing so I have to touch my legs to make sure my pants are still there. Sounds silly but it is very distressing. Sometimes i can't feel the ground, it's like I'm on clouds. I'm not sure if this is related to my dysphoria and depression but it may be. I feel like i am going crazy.


Yes I am on the waiting list to see therapists. It is just a waiting game now


So I'm asking for advice. Particularly from trans masculine people in similar situations, though all support helps. Also please hold off the hate comments and PM's. I had someone from here message me telling me to kill myself for being nonbinary. That didn't help at all.


Has anyone else experienced anything like this?


How do I deal with the hate?


How can I deal with dysphoria in non medical ways?


I'm becoming filled with despair and having many thoughts of just ending it all

Anyways, I’ve always had a hard time understanding the differences between biological sex, sexuality, and gender. 

After conversations with friends, I’ve learned that gender is considered more cultural and based on how a person feels, as opposed to biological sex, which is based on anatomy (at birth). 

Sexuality and gender are of course different, but I’m a bit confused with recent conversations regarding these.  For example, there have been instances in the past of people identifying themselves (sexuality based) as being attracted to underage people.  This has been frowned upon by most.  Also, there have been instances of people identifying as either younger/older than their “actual” (not sure if correct word choice) age, and/or identifying as inanimate objects.  How are these dictated as being either accurate or inaccurate (aside from moral norms that already exist)?  

In the future, as the US and World become more progressive, how should/will this type of thing be decided on?  

Also, when it comes to things like the census, job applications, college applications, etc, how should this be represented?  I could see gender preferences being on applications and such to ensure the preferred pronouns are used.  However, should this replace the original “biological sex” section?  To my understanding, some medical factors can come into play here, and I’d really like to learn everyone’s thoughts.  

Once again, I’m not looking to debate anything, or get into any discussions.  I’d really just like to learn more and gain a deeper understanding.

127,2018-11-26 06:29:12,a0gw1w,4,1,"Hey everybody.
I'm afab and agender.
Been on T for just over a year now.

The longer I'm on T though, the more I start to get dysphoric from the changes.
I know I'm not cis, and I've known that since childhood, but it almost seems like my dysphoria is incurable and I don't know what to do.

I started T mostly with the intention of changing my voice, and maybe getting some face/body changes. So far, I've had one VERY minor voice drop and nothing else as far as any of those changes go. 
I knew to expect other changes though, and that I couldn't pick and choose them. Even so, I was willing to deal with things I didn't want to deal with severe voice dysphoria. I was always fairly hairy pre-T, and very content with the amount of body hair I had. I had a MAJOR increase in growth almost immediately, and after awhile, I had so much hair that it caused dysphoria, but if I shaved, I also got dysphoria. There's a brief window of time between shaving and full growth where I'm comfortable though. Facial hair? Started growing it by about 2 1/2 months, and usually have to shave daily now. Hate it. Huge source of- you guessed it, dysphoria. I was neutral on bottom growth until about 8 or 9 months in, and out of nowhere, I started hating it too. I'd be willing to accept all of these things if my voice would actually fucking change, but it won't. My T levels are comfortably in the male ranges but not too high, and have been since very early on, not to mention I believe I was told in the past that I have naturally high testosterone levels for someone afab. It really seems like the only positive thing I got out of this whole mess was the end to my monthly cycle (I had one maybe 3 or 4 days after I started T, and that was the last one Ive had). Im desperate for my voice to change but everything else is making me miserable. I'm debating stopping in 6 months at my next appointment, but I really don't know what to do. I look and sound exactly like a somewhat hairier, acne covered version of my pre-T self and it's incredibly discouraging. 

Another issue is my chest and bottom dysphoria. I'm so poor and my efforts at crowdfunding have been pathetic, so I don't see myself reasonanly affording top surgery for another 3-5 years. My family is poor too, so there's no chance of someone else paying for it. 
My bottom dysphoria is a confusing and complicated beast on it's own. I absolutely cannot stand my natal junk, but the idea of having a dick is only slightly better. Both cause me massive amounts of dysphoria. Honestly of metoidioplasty and phalloplasty, phallo is the one that I'd be most comfortable with, but even it just feels so wrong to me. I'm never going to be happy unless I quite literally have no genitals, and I'm not entirely sure that's possible right now, or ever in my lifetime.

133,2018-11-27 16:36:14,a0wh03,0,1,"Hey all!

I just listened to one of my favourite albums, by one of my favourite bands today, and I started to see one particular song, Lose This Skin, with vocals by Tyomon Dogg, in a new light. Regardless of the original intention of the song, I started thinking, damn, this could really be a trans/intersex/genderqueer theme song.  
And, I just wanted to share the new experience I had with this song.

[Here's the song, with lyrics in the description.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtWdVX6LS8w)   
So, I wanna go through the lyrics, with commentary on how I just experienced the song.

*First verse*
&gt; Come with me. I won't hide

""Won't hide"" = I'm coming out. ""Come with me"" = Let's do it together, as in, do it with me, so we stand together - basically following Harvey Milk's idea of how we can normalise trans* people and build tolerance.

&gt; We're going on a ride

Moving from one thing to another - the personal experience of transformation.

&gt; We meet each day, use time to see

Stand together, let's support each other.

&gt; While we're young and almost free

Don't keep postponing your transformation, nor the work to change society towards tolerance and acceptance. We're not *quite* free from our self internalised denial/self-loathing, etc., nor the discriminatrion and hate we face from society at large.

*Chorus*

&gt; I've got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in
&gt; Got to lose this skin I'm imprisoned in

I need to change - ""this skin"" is the body/gender I was born into, but it's a prison, I can't realise myself in it.

*Second verse*

&gt; Do not turn our head to see

&gt; All the things you think we've got

&gt; Do not turn or hate to see

&gt; What happened to the wife of Lot

Most lyrics on the internet say it's ""turn or hate to see"", but that doesn't make sense, unless it's a play on words, when you consider the parallel to the wife of Lot below.  
Anyway, again, this is a parallel to the biblical story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where God says they're not to look back when they flee, or they'll be turned to pillars of salt. Lot's wife does it anyway, and does indeed turn to salt. Anyway, I think this could mean that we shouldn't grow complacent towards change - we still have a road ahead.

*Chorus

*Third verse*

&gt; We're alone or so they say

We're told that we're freaks, this is not normal. We're pariahs, not conforming to expected standards of gender.

&gt; We're not on our own in that way

But he's saying, that's not true. We've got each other, and we've got allies.

&gt; When we're alone it's real tough going

But it's really fucking rough when you feel like you're alone. When you feel like you're a freak for experiencing dysphoria - especially the case for a lot of young people that are not familiar with the fact that they're not alone in their experience.

&gt; We can take a part in someone else's play

But we *can* be there together, support and reassure each other.

*Chorus*

*Fourth verse*

&gt; Come with me, I thought he said

I'm not sure - this sounds like he/she thought they had a friend and an ally. But it turns out they ended up shunning them. I'm not sure, though, when you consider the rest of the verse.

&gt; But that's not him anymore, he's dead

They're not who I thought they were. I've cut ties, because I don't deserve their hate.  
Alternately, though I don't know how this would relate to the previous part of the verse: it could be another trans* who's ""died"" and ""reborn"". They've transformed from their old self, to become their true selves.

&gt; What's it like to be so free

How does it feel to finally be free from that hate? Or, alternately, how does it feel to finally have gone through that transformation, and finally, physically, be your real self.

&gt; So free it looks like lost to me

How does it feel to be free from the cage that was the hate of their ""friend"", or free from the dysphoria of feeling trapped in a body that's not yours.

---

Well, this might not be the original intention of what the song is supposed to be about. It could also be about other ways of feeling alone and shunned, or a host of other things. Though, as I recall, Joe Strummer *did* have an intersex friend and mentor in the 70's. I believe I read that, but now I can't find any sources confirming that.  
In any case, when it comes to art, while it's interesting to ponder the intent of the piece, your own experience and interpretation is just as valid. ""We Are Family"" is the first thing that comes to mind - it wasn't meant to be a queer anthem, but it's now been co-opted, the original artists, Sister Sledge, they've embraced that. I think that has value too.

I guess I should say that I'm not trans* myself, though I am queer, and a big trans* ally. When I use ""I"" or ""we"" in the commentary, it's from the narrator's perspective. I won't pretend to understand your experience completely, but I can emphasise, and try to support my transgender friends as best I can. Anyway, like I said, I haven't experienced your going through what you're going through, and I apologise if I've said anything that might be offensive, or misunderstood something. I *can* say that it's all in good faith, though. :)

Well, a bit of a long winded wall of text, all this, but it was nice for me to put down in writing, and sharing - and if any of this makes sense to someone else, all the better. :)

I  once asked on AVEN (asexuality.org) how non-binary vs. cis vs. trans people dreamed and  what their bodies look like in their dreams and there seems to be some  differences, I'm curious about you guys. I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asking these questions on many other subreddits about gender identity and sexuality (and others) and got some interesting responses.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some questions, I will reply to them below:

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have ""super powers"" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone     else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once ""possessed"" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual.

I want to start with one of the greatest things you ever did for me: To give me a computer -- and get me interested in them. Without question I would not have survived to adulthood without that bit of insight. Second, but no less, that you held on and kept the door open for me growing up. 


I knew living with my dad was a mistake. Even just a few months after the final order came it was obvious to everyone -- except the courts. I couldn't imagine and would not understand until decades later just how monumental the damage was. ""The best interests of the child"" will forever be why I will NEVER trust anyone. 


I refuse to trust anything that describes itself as authority. I will never trust anyone, ever, who says they are acting in my best interests. That's what authority says. Authority lies. At 34, it's clear that scar will be with me the rest of my days. I'll never truly trust anyone but myself. All trust is conditional for me. 


Every fucking kind of expert has tried to fix that twist in me. They're all quite sure of themselves -- that to be a functional adult it's necessary to trust authority. Conforming is about surrendering individuality to the group. That is, reduced to the essential quality, what authority's role is. 

""Incompletely socialized"" is a phrase that accurately described me for a long time. It's impossible to normalize when every person is a threat under shadow -- every interaction has an ulterior motive. The world becomes a dark and terrifying place. My dad's little ""gift"" to me, I suppose. 


He never did find a way out of the darkness. Sometimes I read what the psychologists say about me. I'm afraid I might be the same. Turning out like your parents is a universal fear I suppose. Turning out like MY parents doubly so. No offense.

The only thing that saved me from a life of antisocial tendencies and a lack of respect for others, myself, or life in every manner it can be defined... was you. Only you. You hung on when all others abandoned me. You kept your foot in the door when every last mother fucker said it was pointless, wrongheaded -- and so many other adjectives. I will be forever grateful for that. 


It's precisely because of that love that I've stayed angry at you for so long. You were the last person still worthy of my trust. I knew you would have a hard time with my coming out. I still remember the night you flipped your lid after catching me in a tutu. 


Until then I hadn't felt like I was 'wrong inside' -- just a victim of adults who put me on a chess board called 'best interests'. Being a child it was easy to forgive and forget in spite of the injury. Afterall I was used to it. Even by then I didn't trust anyone who wasn't family. A conflicted family that didn't know how to be one but family all the same. 


I wanted, more than anything in the world, to be a part of a family. To have at least a little peace, trust, love, that I saw everybody else getting. I saw other people effortlessly gliding through life as though life itself was some divine gift. I hated them for that. That above all and perhaps nothing but.


I will remember, for the rest of my life, the day I felt the sun on my face. Not the sensation of the sun but the feeling. The warmth and beauty. In that moment and never before I knew in my heart of hearts it was okay -- to not be okay. It was okay to say it hurt. It was okay to not be strong all the time. The universe opened the door just a crack in that moment to reveal there was more to living than just surviving. Then it slammed it shut again. 


It was still a long journey back into the light. So many feelings I'd never felt before. So much I thought I would explode. That I'd die. 


Every day was too much. Every day I'd lay down in bed. I'd try to breathe when the weight on my chest was so crushing asthma would have been a welcome respite. I'd felt alone or hated for too long. I wasn't entirely sure I could feel any other way. But there you were, still, at the end of all things. 


You'd been there the whole time. How many people could still love someone so damaged? I was barely still a person by the time I got the fuck out of Wisconsin. You loved me anyway. I finally started reconnecting with myself. 

I was filled with a hatred of the world that left me ruined in body and mind. It burned a hole in me, day after day. It lessened just a little, just a tiny bit, each day. Every hug had a tiny bit of forgiveness in a cruel world. It was hope that someday I could pass as a person again. Not some broken thing that had been left to die. 


When I came out a few years later it was to a parent who I thought understood me. Me and my suffering -- in ways nobody else ever could. Rejecting that shattered everything I'd become. I'd left my own personal holocaust. 


I was embarking on a journey very few have ever taken -- and far fewer have survived. It made me question everything. I had been wrong. I *was* wrong. I had to be. It was the only way to reconcile love with hate. Back into the dark I went; The comforting and understanding dark.


I limped on. I'd come too far to turn around by then. I felt filled with a purpose -- to seek out the me I should have been instead of the me that I had become. But it was buried again under a mountain of self-doubt and self-loathing. Yet I kept having these feelings. They just kept bubbling up, insistently, urgently. 


I escaped into depression many times. I just couldn't deal with it. I hated with the burning passion of a thousand suns. I never had the chance to confront and resolve my status as a transgender person when it could have saved me. 


I could have avoided the changes to my body. They now forever define and diminish me. It's a door forever closed. It is doubtful I'll ever transition to the point others can't see me as a ruined person so obviously fitting into neither mold. I still hate myself -- and the world -- at times. It seems an utterly insurmountable challenge to just. be. normal. 


I want to be just a face in the crowd. I know I never will. It costs too much money. Between my odds of surviving all the surgeries, and the odds that they'd ever be good enough to give me what I want -- that's my rock and the hard place. 


That enigma kept sending me back into fucking depression. I exhausted myself from the constant oscillations from one extreme to the other. From joy to fear, love to indifference -- from one hate to the next. To this day I still feel it all. It has not diminished. That's why it's regarded as a mental illness. It's not because of anything I am. It's what it means for every relationship I have... or will ever have.


There is no place I can hide from that. No safe place for me to heal my hurts. No church, no temple, no god -- and no hope. Starting out, I took long drives and long walks. I still searched, as I do today. I'm sure I'll never find what I am looking for: Peace. I try anyway.


Every time I drive, every time I walk, I go west. When I have to think I go west. When I feel too much -- west. Or too little -- west. I didn't realize that for a decade that west was the way I had left Wisconsin. Along with everything that meant to me. West was my safe place. West was the way towards home. An aching for the home I'd never known. 


Eventually, I learned to live with it. I started trusting myself again. I found new reserves of confidence that my emotions were real. That I was real. And, in time, that the world was too. I found the strength that had carried me for so long, but lost so easily. And I turned all of that hate that I felt for the world on you.


That was wrong of me. And, I am sorry. 


I don't believe in apologies. Asking me to apologize with any frequency results in unpleasantness. You do. That's why I have an intense dislike of the word 'gratitude'. The right kind of people never ask for one. The wrong kind of people will just use it against me. I live my life today without apology or shame. I didn't for a long time.


I'm okay admitting that I'm wrong. It was never a problem for me as long as the thing that was wrong wasn't who or what I was. Easiest thing in the world. I had to know -- everything. I had to find home. The only way to do that is with eyes wide open. I have slept for too long already, and staying wrong about any of the particulars of the world just means that much longer I'm delayed in my journey.


I know now why you did what you did. I'm trying to forgive you. Forgiveness for me is far and away the hardest thing to do. Trust is the second hardest thing for me to do. Forgiving others means admitting something that's a part of me was wrong. I misjudged. Made a mistake. It means I misplaced my trust either in myself or someone else. 


There still are things you do that cut me down. I know now it's not on purpose. I know now it's just the symptoms of everything I feel is wrong in myself. That it's the world that's wrong to make me feel this way. Not you. 


I won't talk about those things -- or at least try not to. I'm trying to get away, not from you, but from having these relentless and inescapable feelings. I'm still trying to build a world where it's okay to be me. A place that will love me when I'm there and miss me when I'm gone. And a love that will finally lay down quietly and see me. I just want to be seen. 


This place is not that place. But neither is anywhere else I can go. For me this has always been an inward journey. I have great difficulty in separating the internal and external worlds I inhabit. I often oscillate wildly between them. When one hurts too much, I move to the other. It comes out in strange ways I've never understood. Sometimes I regret the things I've said and done. I swing from one extreme to the next. 


The reason why I am so inescapably angry is because I have felt, every day since I knew that you knew, that you sided with the world instead of me. Something that's so core to who I am was rejected. Every other terrible thing was taken without question or pause. Taken out of unconditional love -- until then. 


That's the true injury. It's not that you don't understand me. Fuck I don't even understand myself. Lots of people don't understand what it means to be transgender. They don't know how it twists a person up inside. Dave doesn't. He's still my best friend. A lifelong friend: Family I chose of my own free will. 


I hate myself for it but not other people. I've felt rejection my whole life. I've been hurt by others my whole life. I am very good at protecting my own identity in a world that seems hell bent on ensuring I have no place in it. 


I am angry that you chose *them* over *me*. They don't deserve my love. The world can burn for all I care. It's wished and tried for nothing less of me. That's how it feels in my heart. In my head... I know better. The two aren't on speaking terms on that one. 


All the therapy in the world can't change those feelings. I know because I've HAD all the therapy in the world. It's a battle that can only be fought and won by me. I am the ground where the war is fought. I fight with myself every day until memory yields. Until feelings yield. 


My head beats my heart into submission each day. It hates me for that, as I hate the world. In no small way I feel betrayed by my own heart -- as I feel betrayed by you. For one it's because it chose the world. For the other it's because it chose me. I'm not entirely sure which is which. 


I hope this long letter gives the answers you're looking for. I don't know how to explain why I'm this way. There is no answer. Some questions just don't have answers. That's a terribly difficult thing for me to accept. It's one I've had to on this. 


What is impossible yields to what is necessary. I'll find what I'm looking for someday; Home and comfort in my own skin. Not answers -- just better questions. It is my hope that in time you will look for the same. We're all searching for something even if we don't know it.

That is, reduced to the essential quality, what authority\'s role is. \n\n""Incompletely socialized"" is a phrase that accurately described me for a long time. It\'s impossible to normalize when every person is a threat under shadow -- every interaction has an ulterior motive. The world becomes a dark and terrifying place. My dad\'s little ""gift"" to me, I suppose. \n\n\nHe never did find a way out of the darkness. Sometimes I read what the psychologists say about me. I\'m afraid I might be the same. Turning out like your parents is a universal fear I suppose. Turning out like MY parents doubly so. No offense.\n\nThe only thing that saved me from a life of antisocial tendencies and a lack of respect for others, myself, or life in every manner it can be defined... was you. Only you. You hung on when all others abandoned me. You kept your foot in the door when every last mother fucker said it was pointless, wrongheaded -- and so many other adjectives. I will be forever grateful for that. \n\n\nIt\'s precisely because of that love that I\'ve stayed angry at you for so long. You were the last person still worthy of my trust. I knew you would have a hard time with my coming out. I still remember the night you flipped your lid after catching me in a tutu. \n\n\nUntil then I hadn\'t felt like I was \'wrong inside\' -- just a victim of adults who put me on a chess board called \'best interests\'. Being a child it was easy to forgive and forget in spite of the injury. Afterall I was used to it. Even by then I didn\'t trust anyone who wasn\'t family. A conflicted family that didn\'t know how to be one but family all the same. \n\n\nI wanted, more than anything in the world, to be a part of a family. To have at least a little peace, trust, love, that I saw everybody else getting. I saw other people effortlessly gliding through life as though life itself was some divine gift. I hated them for that. That above all and perhaps nothing but.\n\n\nI will remember, for the rest of my life, the day I felt the sun on my face. Not the sensation of the sun but the feeling. The warmth and beauty. In that moment and never before I knew in my heart of hearts it was okay -- to not be okay. It was okay to say it hurt. It was okay to not be strong all the time. The universe opened the door just a crack in that moment to reveal there was more to living than just surviving. Then it slammed it shut again. \n\n\nIt was still a long journey back into the light. So many feelings I\'d never felt before. So much I thought I would explode. That I\'d die. \n\n\nEvery day was too much. Every day I\'d lay down in bed. I\'d try to breathe when the weight on my chest was so crushing asthma would have been a welcome respite. I\'d felt alone or hated for too long. I wasn\'t entirely sure I could feel any other way. But there you were, still, at the end of all things. \n\n\nYou\'d been there the whole time. How many people could still love someone so damaged? I was barely still a person by the time I got the fuck out of Wisconsin. You loved me anyway. I finally started reconnecting with myself. \n\nI was filled with a hatred of the world that left me ruined in body and mind. It burned a hole in me, day after day. It lessened just a little, just a tiny bit, each day. Every hug had a tiny bit of forgiveness in a cruel world. It was hope that someday I could pass as a person again. Not some broken thing that had been left to die. \n\n\nWhen I came out a few years later it was to a parent who I thought understood me. Me and my suffering -- in ways nobody else ever could. Rejecting that shattered everything I\'d become. I\'d left my own personal holocaust. \n\n\nI was embarking on a journey very few have ever taken -- and far fewer have survived. It made me question everything. I had been wrong. I *was* wrong. I had to be. It was the only way to reconcile love with hate. Back into the dark I went; The comforting and understanding dark.\n\n\nI limped on. I\'d come too far to turn around by then. I felt filled with a purpose -- to seek out the me I should have been instead of the me that I had become. But it was buried again under a mountain of self-doubt and self-loathing. Yet I kept having these feelings. They just kept bubbling up, insistently, urgently. \n\n\nI escaped into depression many times. I just couldn\'t deal with it. I hated with the burning passion of a thousand suns. I never had the chance to confront and resolve my status as a transgender person when it could have saved me. \n\n\nI could have avoided the changes to my body. They now forever define and diminish me. It\'s a door forever closed. It is doubtful I\'ll ever transition to the point others can\'t see me as a ruined person so obviously fitting into neither mold. I still hate myself -- and the world -- at times. It seems an utterly insurmountable challenge to just. be. normal. \n\n\nI want to be just a face in the crowd. I know I never will. It costs too much money. Between my odds of surviving all the surgeries, and the odds that they\'d ever be good enough to give me what I want -- that\'s my rock and the hard place. \n\n\nThat enigma kept sending me back into fucking depression. I exhausted myself from the constant oscillations from one extreme to the other. From joy to fear, love to indifference -- from one hate to the next. To this day I still feel it all. It has not diminished. That\'s why it\'s regarded as a mental illness. It\'s not because of anything I am. It\'s what it means for every relationship I have... or will ever have.\n\n\nThere is no place I can hide from that. No safe place for me to heal my hurts. No church, no temple, no god -- and no hope. Starting out, I took long drives and long walks. I still searched, as I do today. I\'m sure I\'ll never find what I am looking for: Peace. I try anyway.\n\n\nEvery time I drive, every time I walk, I go west. When I have to think I go west. When I feel too much -- west. Or too little -- west. I didn\'t realize that for a decade that west was the way I had left Wisconsin. Along with everything that meant to me. West was my safe place. West was the way towards home. An aching for the home I\'d never known. \n\n\nEventually, I learned to live with it. I started trusting myself again. I found new reserves of confidence that my emotions were real. That I was real. And, in time, that the world was too. I found the strength that had carried me for so long, but lost so easily. And I turned all of that hate that I felt for the world on you.\n\n\nThat was wrong of me. And, I am sorry. \n\n\nI don\'t believe in apologies. Asking me to apologize with any frequency results in unpleasantness. You do. That\'s why I have an intense dislike of the word \'gratitude\'. The right kind of people never ask for one. The wrong kind of people will just use it against me. I live my life today without apology or shame. I didn\'t for a long time.\n\n\nI\'m okay admitting that I\'m wrong. It was never a problem for me as long as the thing that was wrong wasn\'t who or what I was. Easiest thing in the world. I had to know -- everything. I had to find home. The only way to do that is with eyes wide open. I have slept for too long already, and staying wrong about any of the particulars of the world just means that much longer I\'m delayed in my journey.\n\n\nI know now why you did what you did. I\'m trying to forgive you. Forgiveness for me is far and away the hardest thing to do. Trust is the second hardest thing for me to do. Forgiving others means admitting something that\'s a part of me was wrong. I misjudged. Made a mistake. It means I misplaced my trust either in myself or someone else. \n\n\nThere still are things you do that cut me down. I know now it\'s not on purpose. I know now it\'s just the symptoms of everything I feel is wrong in myself. That it\'s the world that\'s wrong to make me feel this way. Not you. \n\n\nI won\'t talk about those things -- or at least try not to. I\'m trying to get away, not from you, but from having these relentless and inescapable feelings. I\'m still trying to build a world where it\'s okay to be me. A place that will love me when I\'m there and miss me when I\'m gone. And a love that will finally lay down quietly and see me. I just want to be seen. \n\n\nThis place is not that place. But neither is anywhere else I can go. For me this has always been an inward journey. I have great difficulty in separating the internal and external worlds I inhabit. I often oscillate wildly between them. When one hurts too much, I move to the other. It comes out in strange ways I\'ve never understood. Sometimes I regret the things I\'ve said and done. I swing from one extreme to the next. \n\n\nThe reason why I am so inescapably angry is because I have felt, every day since I knew that you knew, that you sided with the world instead of me. Something that\'s so core to who I am was rejected. Every other terrible thing was taken without question or pause. Taken out of unconditional love -- until then. \n\n\nThat\'s the true injury. It\'s not that you don\'t understand me. Fuck I don\'t even understand myself. Lots of people don\'t understand what it means to be transgender. They don\'t know how it twists a person up inside. Dave doesn\'t. He\'s still my best friend. A lifelong friend: Family I chose of my own free will. \n\n\nI hate myself for it but not other people. I\'ve felt rejection my whole life. I\'ve been hurt by others my whole life. I am very good at protecting my own identity in a world that seems hell bent on ensuring I have no place in it. \n\n\nI am angry that you chose *them* over *me*. They don\'t deserve my love. The world can burn for all I care. It\'s wished and tried for nothing less of me. That\'s how it feels in my heart. In my head... I know better. The two aren\'t on speaking terms on that one. \n\n\nAll the therapy in the world can\'t change those feelings. I know because I\'ve HAD all the therapy in the world. It\'s a battle that can only be fought and won by me. I am the ground where the war is fought. I fight with myself every day until memory yields. Until feelings yield. \n\n\nMy head beats my heart into submission each day. It hates me for that, as I hate the world. In no small way I feel betrayed by my own heart -- as I feel betrayed by you. For one it\'s because it chose the world. For the other it\'s because it chose me. I\'m not entirely sure which is which. \n\n\nI hope this long letter gives the answers you\'re looking for. I don\'t know how to explain why I\'m this way. There is no answer. Some questions just don\'t have answers. That\'s a terribly difficult thing for me to accept. It\'s one I\'ve had to on this. \n\n\nWhat is impossible yields to what is necessary. I\'ll find what I\'m looking for someday; Home and comfort in my own skin. Not answers -- just better questions. It is my hope that in time you will look for the same. We\'re all searching for something even if we don\'t know it. \n\n\nWith love,\n', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'The letter home, and how I dealt with my mother rejecting my queer status [Trigger warning: pretty much everything] [LONG]', 'created': 1543561650.0}"

The part of me who was raised in the bible belt wants to think that I'm just rebelling against gender roles, but sometimes it goes beyond that. I guess I'm okay with myself as I am now, just not happy with the size of my chest and hips, but happy enough with a deep voice for someone born female. After thinking about it for a while, taking in how I currently live, I'm more andro than I thought I was, even though I come off as female.

I just want to feel more comfortable in myself, and start finding who I am and what helps me be me. I'm working on becoming more healthy so that I can start dressing the way I like, something like andro/masc, though I don't think I'll be able to pull it off with my height (5'1"") and body. I want to at least try, and feel more like me. The part I feel most hesitant about applies to the days I feel more masculine than usual. I guess I tend to feel andro on most days, maybe feminine once in a blue moon. Masculine days are just on and off at a moments notice, sometimes for a few days, sometimes for a few hours. I feel really insecure about it because of how I appear and because of how I'm always perceived as a ""quiet little young woman"". I feel like if I go for the look I like, it'll just appear as if I'm playing dress up or in a costume. I even feel hesitant saying how and who I feel I am.

I am AFAB currently identifying as genderfluid. Typically, I am more feminine in the summer months and more masculine in the winter months (I usually switch between female, male, and agender)

For a long time I was comfortable with this label, but now I'm facing this horrible, uncomfortable, and just sickening feeling of not knowing who I am anymore. Every time I say that I am genderfluid, something just feels off. Sometimes, I want to dress masculine and present myself as a male (even though I do not look the part at all. Still working on that) but I feel guilty and uncomfortable. I feel sick and just like its not worth it to try. I dress pretty androgynous anyways but its still leaning on the feminine side of things. I even bought a binder, but can't bring myself to wear it because I feel too guilty and anxious to leave my room with it on. I just feel so sick and guilty and depressed about it all. 

Pronouns are a mystery to me and I've tried different ones out and they just don't do much for me. 

I try to talk with my therapist about it and she just changes the subject or shuts me down saying ""but, you don't really have to know yet do you?"". And like, I see where she comes from and I don't mind not knowing. I mind being so incredibly uncomfortable and feeling so guilty that all I want to do is cry and sleep. 

Sorry I know that was long and complete word vomit, but do any of you guys have any advice? Is what I'm feeling dysphoria? (because I don't want to use that term just in case I don't have it and then offend people, ect.) Any tips to help it?

This process takes about a week, and then after a week, it goes back to being female. My thoughts and behavior will change, I will start having all these symptoms that come and go during the week and a half I become more male: that consist of nausea, fatigue, depression, one migraine, a lot of headaches, prickling feelings, wrist pains, jaw pains, moodiness, irritability, sensitivity down there, sex drive, and loss/gain of appetite. I have never ever had PMS symptoms this bad before (if it is PMS, my birth control if fine and I checked with my gynecologist). My female body will also not feel right, and I will experience dysphoria and need to change my clothes. This has been happening *consistently* over the last 3 months (I have been tracking it).   


I also discovered that I have something like a split personality, who is male. However he doesn't really want to come out or sees much of a point to it. I did discover him 3 months ago as well. My personality will be the same almost every day (female, Julia). However the body will undergo that female to male change, and the mind will follow or vice versa. After a week and a half after the start of the month the body and mind will start to transition back to female.   


The hardest part is that it's having an effect on my 4 year relationship with my boyfriend. During that time that I am becoming male in mind and body he will be unattractive sexually and romantically to me (since he is attracted to women), and I will be the same for him as my sexuality changes too(I'll be attracted to either different types of men or just women body).

I’ve recently been trying to learn a lot about gender and identities and basically everything in the subject matter. I’ve found myself being able to complete full affirmative and negative arguments ‘for’ and ‘against’ the whole gender spectrum and identity business, but I am still unsure what backing arguments can complete these topics. 

Specifically, I’m asking what the benefit is of identifying yourself as non-binary or genderfluid, and I would really like to have a thorough explanation on the gender spectrum theory (genderspectrum.org’s only explanation is “gender is a spectrum”). Can anybody help me?

I would really like to be able to connect more with my ex-partner, who identifies themselves as genderfluid. 

I appreciate the feedback about the terminology I use, and as is expected, it wouldn’t hurt to have sources to your facts. 

Thank you all so much!!! &lt;3",genderfluid,I’m not educated on the topic.,1542624290.0,"{'created_utc': 1542599090, 'id': '9yd28a', 'num_comments': 3, 'score': 1, 'selftext': 'Hello all,\n\nI’ve recently been trying to learn a lot about gender and identities and basically everything in the subject matter.

104,2018-11-23 16:58:16,9zpwmw,2,1,"Hi! I’m Emma. At least, I feel that way right now. I don’t quite understand what it is that I’m feeling. Starting at the beginning...

I’ve lived my whole 38 years as Chris, cis-male. He/him and without question into feminine. I accepted a while ago that while I prefer female sexual parts, I’m not repulsed by male parts; I however am NOT into masculine, like, at all. 

I’ve always felt kind of... off. I don’t hate my body, and i don’t hate my parts. On and off throughout my life, I’d wondered “what if there was a surgery where like you switched brains with a woman like a brain transplant but then you got to live as her and she you” or something like that. I like overtly feminine things, especially if they come in pink. I use a pink pen to take notes, I have worn Victoria’s Secret Love Spell, things like that. I always thought I would be an awesome lesbian. 

There’s a little voice in my head that has been getting louder and louder and louder and I finally listened to it. I told my wife that while I am not unhappy, I’m not exactly happy, either. It took a lot of talking out and over explaining, but eventually I got words out that I didn’t even realize were there: I’d like it if you called me Emma. I want to dress cute and be pretty and I feel extra super feminine right now and I just wanna be a girl ok?!?

Now my wife is an amazing supporting person, and she just says “yeah I figured actually I’ve kind of always known that”. She cried because she doesn’t want to say goodbye to Chris, and I didn’t (and still don’t) know if I want to either. 

That said, right now I want to be Emma, and it’s been euphoric, elation, bliss, pure unfiltered happy! I can’t believe I never saw the world like this! The sky is prettier, music sounds better, I can’t even begin to comprehend the world right now!

Then last night, wifey helped me put on some makeup. I was so frightened to look at myself in the mirror when she was done, and when I did, I broke down crying. For like five minutes all I did was fuck up my mascara and liner with the happiest tears I’ve ever cried in my life. Turn that up even higher when my wig got here!

I know that I’m Emma now. My three kids all reacted slightly differently but still awesome. My 12 year old son said “whatever wear pink and long hair it really doesn’t bother me why do you keep asking if it does? I don’t care.” (He is super socially awkward, so don’t take that as teenage sarcasm; he really doesn’t care that I’m Emma).

My 6 year old daughter thinks that my long hair is pretty. 

I can’t sort out everything that I’m feeling. I don’t even think I managed to get it all down correctly here! I don’t know if it’s the euphoria of letting Emma out of her tiny dark lockbox and being so completely her... which is the difficultly I have. 

I AM Emma. My name is Emma. My wife calls me Emma now. I don’t want to go back to being Chris, but I live in one of those dumb red states that can’t even elect the second most empowering and amazing candidate for senator I ever heard speak (President Obama being the first, and Congressman O’Rourke being who we Texans should have elected but don’t get me started). I don’t HATE being Chris, but at the same time, I don’t want to look back or go back. I love being me and I am Emma and I’m so happy now, why would I do that?

I guess, long story short... Hi, I’m Emma. I’m new here, I don’t know anyone like me, and I could use some friends and a really good therapist.

At least, I feel that way right now. I don’t quite understand what it is that I’m feeling. Starting at the beginning...\n\nI’ve lived my whole 38 years as Chris, cis-male. He/him and without question into feminine. I accepted a while ago that while I prefer female sexual parts, I’m not repulsed by male parts; I however am NOT into masculine, like, at all. \n\nI’ve always felt kind of... off. I don’t hate my body, and i don’t hate my parts. On and off throughout my life, I’d wondered “what if there was a surgery where like you switched brains with a woman like a brain transplant but then you got to live as her and she you” or something like that. I like overtly feminine things, especially if they come in pink. I use a pink pen to take notes, I have worn Victoria’s Secret Love Spell, things like that. I always thought I would be an awesome lesbian. \n\nThere’s a little voice in my head that has been getting louder and louder and louder and I finally listened to it. I told my wife that while I am not unhappy, I’m not exactly happy, either. It took a lot of talking out and over explaining, but eventually I got words out that I didn’t even realize were there: I’d like it if you called me Emma. I want to dress cute and be pretty and I feel extra super feminine right now and I just wanna be a girl ok?!?\n\nNow my wife is an amazing supporting person, and she just says “yeah I figured actually I’ve kind of always known that”. She cried because she doesn’t want to say goodbye to Chris, and I didn’t (and still don’t) know if I want to either. \n\nThat said, right now I want to be Emma, and it’s been euphoric, elation, bliss, pure unfiltered happy! I can’t believe I never saw the world like this! The sky is prettier, music sounds better, I can’t even begin to comprehend the world right now!\n\nThen last night, wifey helped me put on some makeup. I was so frightened to look at myself in the mirror when she was done, and when I did, I broke down crying. For like five minutes all I did was fuck up my mascara and liner with the happiest tears I’ve ever cried in my life. Turn that up even higher when my wig got here!\n\nI know that I’m Emma now. My three kids all reacted slightly differently but still awesome. My 12 year old son said “whatever wear pink and long hair it really doesn’t bother me why do you keep asking if it does? I don’t care.” (He is super socially awkward, so don’t take that as teenage sarcasm; he really doesn’t care that I’m Emma). My 11 year old said “as long as you’re happy, dad!” (Because I haven’t quite felt ok telling them I’d rather be a girl, they just see me dressing different).

107,2018-11-24 21:35:09,a02hf1,5,1,"The last few years (I’m 20) I’ve noticed that I feel more and more like my gender(I suppose to everyone else it’s male) has been imposed on me more than anything. 

I’m not uncomfortable usually with masc pronouns, but I notice that in casual conversation when people refer to me as a “man”, I have this kind of hitch in my thinking, like, “oh, well, I guess...” while really never applying the same word to myself in my head. I don’t think I attach pronouns to myself when I’m thinking about myself, but I don’t think I really identify as male over anything else.

He responded by pointing out that according to this, in my ideal world, I’m not identifying as male. 

I’ve always thought of myself as a cis male despite feeling neutral/androgynous, because I haven’t ever felt any attachment to any other pronouns or labels. Maybe I have a bad focus on having a label, but it’s how I’ve thought about it in the past. 

I guess what I’m saying is that I think I very well might not identify as 100% male if I’m being totally honest with myself. “They/them” doesn’t pop out to me, but I suppose they don’t have to. I just don’t feel male some days. I don’t know if I feel like anything on other days.

123,2018-11-28 02:39:57,a11xn6,6,1,"Hi,

I  once asked on AVEN (asexuality.org) how non-binary vs. cis vs. trans people dreamed and  what their bodies look like in their dreams and there seems to be some  differences, I'm curious about you guys. I am unsure as to whether I am  non-binary, agender or female.

&amp;#x200B;

I have been asking these questions on many other subreddits about gender identity and sexuality (and others) and got some interesting responses.

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some questions, I will reply to them below:

1. Do you know you are dreaming during your dreams?
2. What   POV/perspective do you dream on? (first person, third person, other    persons POV, not present/ feels like watching a movie, alternate    between perspectives, etc...)
3. Do you feel any physical sensations in your dreams?
4. Are your dreams usually realistic or surreal?
5. Do you have ""super powers"" in your dreams? (ie flying, breathing underwater, invulnerability, etc...)
6. Is your dream body different from your real one? If so, how so?
7. Do    you have any dreams where you start out as yourself (or someone     else)  then swap into someone else's body and see the body you were     before  through their eyes, then swap back again, and so on, and do you     ever see  sometimes both people at the same time in 3rd person? Do  you    alternate  between controlling either?
8. Do you control your actions in your dreams? Do you have any degree of control over your dreams?
9. How fast does time go by in your dreams? Is it like waking life, faster, or like a movie?
10. What is your sexual orientation and gender identity? (I think this manifests itself in dreams)

My answers:

1. I always know I am dreaming.
2. Usually   3rd person (I see myself from outside of my body while still    controlling it), sometimes 1st person, occasionally alternate, rarely I    am not present and I am just an observer and I remember having at  least   once ""possessed"" another person's body and controlled them.
3. No, I don't feel anything.
4. They are quite surreal.
5. Yes,   I can fly/float in the air sometimes, breathe underwater and I am    usually invulnerable. I can also rewind and change the future sometimes    and change the scene when the dream takes a turn I don't like.
6. Usually   my body is the same, but I dream of myself often in the body of  other   women, in a male body, in the body of some videogame character, as  a   fictional character or actor, some animal, etc... I often alternate  in   the same dream.
7. Not that I remember. When I swap bodies my body usually disappears.
8. I can control my actions fully, and the environment to a degree.
9. In   my dreams time seems to go by faster than normal. My dreams are  usually  long and lots of things happen. I can fill 2+ pages just with  keywords  when I wake up (I keep a dream journal and when I wake up I  just write  down the keywords to help me remember)
10. Female, hetero-romantic asexual.

136,2018-11-30 05:17:19,a1ph36,2,1,"Hi, people! I've been questioning my gender for about the past month - although it's not the first time in my life I have it's the first time in years that I've allowed myself to (I made a longer post in r/nonbinary a few weeks ago that explains more on that). 

All I really know right now is I'm non-binary but I'm posting here because I'm thinking more and more that I might be genderfluid more specifically. In the beginning I didn't wanna id as genderfluid because the word wasn't ""clicking"" but the more I think about it, the more it does pretty much describe how I feel, I think? 

Basically I fluctuate between feeling ""mostly girl"" and ""mostly boy"" or somewhere in-between. I relate to both the terms ""demigirl"" and ""demiboy"" as in feeling partially girl+agender and partially boy+agender, and also have days where just feel agender altogether. But even my boy/girl sides don't feel fully connected to either gender, and I don't wanna be called man/woman, etc or any gendered words besides girl or boy depending on my mood (and other times I wanna be called none of these). 

I'm afab and still fem-aligned I think no matter what. Like I still like being feminine over masculine and even my boy side is feminine. I do still feel connected to certain things about being ""a girl"" in the sense of stuff like feminism, girl power, and sapphic love (I'm also Bi). So I don't hate my agab or want to completely reject it but I just feel like I've never fully connected with womanhood and have these other parts of me I need to express too like wanting to be a boy sometimes. I have days where I feel like I need to distance myself from being called ""girl"" because it's not my mood that day, even though I still wanna be one at other times. 

I also think I'm ok with any pronouns but I prefer they and she pronouns; they for any/all moods and she for my more girl moods or just apathetic moods. In boy mode, I prefer they/them to he/him but wouldn't care if I got called that either (especially if it means I've managed to pass as a boy). 

First of all: Does this sound like genderfluid? Or am I something else considering that I don't really have very ""masculine"" moods (as a girl, I'm often considered tomboy-ish but no one would call me masculine as a boy). Can you be genderfluid but still fem-aligned and such? Also I still have a prevailing feeling of being agender overall and don't really ever feel wholly like a woman/man? 

Or maybe I'm overthinking everything and am just a girl who is trying too hard to feel special? I still really like girly things and pink and such...

The second thing I wanna ask: If I am genderfluid, is it normal to feel frustrated by not being ""static"" enough in my identity? Like it makes you less of a whole individual? I don't wanna feel like I'm these two different people sharing the same body. I still wanna just be me. 

I think that's why I'm having trouble accepting being genderfluid. I'm in a weird spot where I feel like genderfluid describes me and is a helpful term and come close to accepting it and then I get frustrated again and start looking for more ""static"" terms to describe me. Like at first I was just gonna say ""non-binary"" or ""demigirl"" but I've realized how much I have this ""demiboy"" side too and need to distance myself from the word girl at those times... genderfluid kinda encompasses both I think?

Also: Would it be ok to use ""nonbinary""/""enby"" still but also use genderfluid as a more specific term? Like can I use both? I also really like the genderfluid flag over the nb one cuz it has pink on it but of course that's mainly unimportant lol. But I generally like how much easier it is to say nb/""enby"".

This is getting long but I feel like I have so much to figure out and this isn't even half of it. I'm mulling over stuff like my gender expression, hair, name, etc too. On one hand, starting to question myself and accept that I'm probably nb has felt amazing but it's been pretty confusing and distressing.

In the beginning I didn\'t wanna id as genderfluid because the word wasn\'t ""clicking"" but the more I think about it, the more it does pretty much describe how I feel, I think? \n\nBasically I fluctuate between feeling ""mostly girl"" and ""mostly boy"" or somewhere in-between. I relate to both the terms ""demigirl"" and ""demiboy"" as in feeling partially girl+agender and partially boy+agender, and also have days where just feel agender altogether. But even my boy/girl sides don\'t feel fully connected to either gender, and I don\'t wanna be called man/woman, etc or any gendered words besides girl or boy depending on my mood (and other times I wanna be called none of these). \n\nI\'m afab and still fem-aligned I think no matter what. Like I still like being feminine over masculine and even my boy side is feminine. I do still feel connected to certain things about being ""a girl"" in the sense of stuff like feminism, girl power, and sapphic love (I\'m also Bi). So I don\'t hate my agab or want to completely reject it but I just feel like I\'ve never fully connected with womanhood and have these other parts of me I need to express too like wanting to be a boy sometimes. I have days where I feel like I need to distance myself from being called ""girl"" because it\'s not my mood that day, even though I still wanna be one at other times. \n\nI also think I\'m ok with any pronouns but I prefer they and she pronouns; they for any/all moods and she for my more girl moods or just apathetic moods. In boy mode, I prefer they/them to he/him but wouldn\'t care if I got called that either (especially if it means I\'ve managed to pass as a boy). \n\nFirst of all: Does this sound like genderfluid? Or am I something else considering that I don\'t really have very ""masculine"" moods (as a girl, I\'m often considered tomboy-ish but no one would call me masculine as a boy). Can you be genderfluid but still fem-aligned and such? Also I still have a prevailing feeling of being agender overall and don\'t really ever feel wholly like a woman/man? \n\nOr maybe I\'m overthinking everything and am just a girl who is trying too hard to feel special? I still really like girly things and pink and such...\n\nThe second thing I wanna ask: If I am genderfluid, is it normal to feel frustrated by not being ""static"" enough in my identity? Like it makes you less of a whole individual? I don\'t wanna feel like I\'m these two different people sharing the same body. I still wanna just be me. \n\nI think that\'s why I\'m having trouble accepting being genderfluid. I\'m in a weird spot where I feel like genderfluid describes me and is a helpful term and come close to accepting it and then I get frustrated again and start looking for more ""static"" terms to describe me. Like at first I was just gonna say ""non-binary"" or ""demigirl"" but I\'ve realized how much I have this ""demiboy"" side too and need to distance myself from the word girl at those times... genderfluid kinda encompasses both I think?\n\nAlso: Would it be ok to use ""nonbinary""/""enby"" still but also use genderfluid as a more specific term? Like can I use both? I also really like the genderfluid flag over the nb one cuz it has pink on it but of course that\'s mainly unimportant lol. But I generally like how much easier it is to say nb/""enby"".\n\nThis is getting long but I feel like I have so much to figure out and this isn\'t even half of it. I\'m mulling over stuff like my gender expression, hair, name, etc too. On one hand, starting to question myself and accept that I\'m probably nb has felt amazing but it\'s been pretty confusing and distressing.

I was born a female. I don't feel fully female. I dislike what would be considered the ""usual feminine things"", I'm not trying to force anyone into a ""feminine box"" at all, but i hope you get what i mean... I feel so much more comfortable in what is more considered masculine clothing, but thats hard to do because I am a VERY thin person, i weigh 89 lbs and am 5'4 so its hard to find clothes that suit how i want to be. Its not just clothing either. Ever since they started growing, I've hated, absolutely LOATHED having breasts, and often wear sports bras because they flatten my chest and i like the way it feels to me. However, I'm not trans... I dont WANT to be a male, I just hate these things I have on my chest and I some times want to get them removed but I simply can't. It would ruin absolutely every relationship I have, including my 2 year relationship with my girlfriend.

I dont know what this is because a FAR larger percentage of the time i feel more masculine, so i dont think it's genderfluid, but I dont want to fully transition into a male...

What is happening to me. This has been on my mind since I was 16, I'm 22 now and usually can stifle it but some times I go absolutely friggn bonkers if it worms its way into my head like it has tonight.
