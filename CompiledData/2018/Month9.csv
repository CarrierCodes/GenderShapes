Aside from transgenders who have body dysmorphia, a serious disorder. \n\nSo, let‚Äôs say you identify as non binary, or gender fluid or whatever. But your sex is male. That wouldn‚Äôt make sense then. You‚Äôre a non-binary male?\n\nConclusion : if gender and sex are two different things, wouldn‚Äôt you still be male or female if you were genderfluid?\n\nMaybe I‚Äôm just ignorant, but I‚Äôm personally tired of this gender shit. \n', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Been thinking about this', 'created': 1535951771.0}"

I'm having a slight identity crisis over if I am indeed nonbinary or not.
Ever since I was a kid I didn't really stick to the  female stereotype nor male stereotype. 
I felt pretty neutral about literally everything, cloth, toys etc.
When i reach puberty relating to being a girl became harder, everything other girls my age didn't make any sense to me, I adopted a boyish style and it made me feel so comfortable, yet I didn't relate to boys either. Both genders felt foreign to me.
When I was 15 I got romantically involved with an older boy - he was 20, I know that's pretty messed up- who kept pushing me to be more ""girly"" asking me to wear make up and stop being boyish and it made me so uncomfortable. That until he dumbed me, and it wracked my self-worth.
After that I became obsessed with being a ""girl"" I did everything from make-up to pretty girly cloth and I did succeed and was very female passing and very attractive and I remember I used to get pretty upset when I get misgendered ( when someone uses he/him pronounces) .
But it made me miserable, it only fed my insecurities and I felt ugly/worthless whenever I didn't dress like a girl or wore make-up.
I was pretty depressed then, I didn't feel better until I stopped pushing myself, stopped wearing make-up and overly girly cloth. 
The more I became gender neutral the better I felt, and that when I learn about Nonbinary.
It made so much sense.
I don't feel like I identify as strictly a male or female, any pronounce is fine with me, even tho she/her is more appealing cause idk I'm really used to it? But does the fact that I still like some aspects about female gender (I don't think I'm a demigirl) or using she/her pronounces makes me less of a nb ?

how is non-binary any different than being a masculine woman or feminine man? 

what if non-binary people just have difficulty coping with being gender non-conforming with regards to their expression to the point they feel they must claim a new gender identity?

since some non-binary people claim to have gender dysphoria, are they dysphoric of both masculine and feminine traits? do non-binary people transition to androgyny? do most non-binary people even transition?

why are most non-binary people ""assigned female at birth""? is it because of internalized misogyny? trying to get attention?

I came out to my parents a little while back, and I'm getting to the point where I really need to come out to my immediate family (siblings, niblings, etc.) and start living openly as trans. I was in a queer prom music recently, and it got posted a few days ago. The song is about gender non-conformity, which seems like the perfect avenue into this discussion.

I have a whole bunch of immediate family and I don't see them all that often so doing it face-to-face isn't really an option, but we have a family facebook group where I want to post my coming out letter. But I've not done this whole coming out thing very well before, so I'd really appreciate some feedback. Is it too long/too wordy? I'm a mess of anxiety right now and idk how to preface this very well lmao but I'd love it if people let me know your thoughts, if I should change anything, and some general encouragement because I'm highkey freaking out about doing this, but I know I need to do it today or it'll take me forever to build up the courage (I've already chickened out so many times)

&gt;I was in a music video!! (for like three shots of the back of my head, but still)  
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzU7aIk1dGI&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzU7aIk1dGI&amp;feature=youtu.be)  
The first time I heard this song, it resonated with me so much and encapsulated near-perfectly how I‚Äôve been feeling for some time, so to get to be part of the queer prom shoot for Grace was such an amazing day, and it‚Äôs been an important part of me gaining the confidence to start being open about my own identity and start living authentically. So I‚Äôve got something important I want to share with you guys, and it‚Äôs been a long time coming. It‚Äôs the kind of thing I‚Äôd ideally like to talk to y‚Äôall about in person, but there are so bloody many of you that this is the only convenient way to get the word out.  
As a baby, I was sorted into the ‚Äúpink‚Äù category, but about two and a half years ago now, I realised that ‚Äúwoman/girl‚Äù didn‚Äôt accurately describe the way I felt. I‚Äôve always been tomboyish and never really cared about whether my actions, the clothes I wore, the toys I played with, etc. were considered masculine or feminine, but I ended up discovering it ran much deeper than that ‚Äì I‚Äôm not just a tomboyish girl, and there were underlying reasons for the fact I felt disconnected to the feminine identity that other girls my age seemed so in-tune with.  
I came to find that the labels ‚Äútransgender‚Äù and ‚Äúnon-binary‚Äù was the best way to describe me (which are terms referring to people who identify with a different gender than the one they were assigned at birth, and people who don‚Äôt wholly identify as male or female respectively), rather than man or woman. Over the better part of three years since I realised this, I‚Äôve only become more sure that it‚Äôs the right thing for me. Living and presenting as female feels dishonest, and it makes me really uncomfortable to be seen as something that I‚Äôm not, whereas introducing myself to people as the non-binary person I am is really liberating and makes me feel so much happier and more comfortable, even though it‚Äôs really scary to come out as something that a lot of people may not understand or believe in.  
In terms of what this means for you guys, I‚Äôd really appreciate it if people referred to be with gender-neutral language and used they/them/theirs pronouns for me (i.e. ‚Äúthis is my sibling **deadname**, they are a ginger.‚Äù), including when I‚Äôm not around. I appreciate it‚Äôs a difficult thing to get used to so please don‚Äôt worry if you mess up! (I haven‚Äôt found a good gender-neutral term for aunt/uncle, but y‚Äôall just call me by my name anyways.)  
I know some of you might not be super familiar with trans/non-binary identities, so if you have any questions at all (even if you worry they sound silly), please feel free to ask them! I‚Äôd also appreciate if y‚Äôall could let me know if you‚Äôve seen this by messaging me/commenting/reacting or something, just so I know who knows.  
Thank you for reading this, sorry for the essay! This is something really important to me, and because it‚Äôs so important, it‚Äôs taken me a long time to build up the courage to tell the people I care about the most, but I‚Äôm ready now to stop pretending to be something I‚Äôm not.  
Lots of love &lt;3

p.s., the deadname bit isn't gonna be like that - I'm trying to come out in baby steps and I want to give my family more time to get used to my gender identity before I start talking about changing my name, so for now I'm keeping my name as it is until I've had more time to try out/get comfortable with the name I've chosen.

She accepted almost immediately. She said she saw me as that person. But since then she has used masculine terms like handsome or my boy (meant to be positive) that make me uncomfortable. I really want to tell her I just want to use ‚Äúthey‚Äù pronouns. I know I should do this. It shouldn‚Äôt be a question.

Response from parents was very good, all ""we support you and love you unconditionally"". Great!

Fast forward a month, parents are visiting me for the weekend. (This is why I came out to them when I did.) They have not been practising, there's ""she"" and ""her"" and ""daughter"" all over the place, and reminders only seemed to stick for like 10 minutes before they slid straight back into the wrong pronouns. Not great!

I sent them a message after they left to express my disappointment and remind them that correct pronouns are not optional. Their response was... baffling. As far as I can tell, it boils down to:

1) They thought it would be easier to switch pronouns when they were here with me, so didn't bother for the previous month.
2) They seem to think I want to eliminate all gendered pronouns for everyone everywhere. Literally, they said, ""Is the intention to phase out she/he/him/her entirely or are there circumstances where they remain appropriate? e.g. perhaps discussion of the merits of burqa/niqab wearing which is pretty gender specific"".

(I have no link to Islam and don't wear any sort of head or face covering.)

What.

Leaving aside for a minute how we got from me being agender to talking about burqas... how incurious and disinterested do you have to be to misunderstand things that completely? nbd, just their child's entire identity, no need to do any asking or googling or thinking. The ""changing pronouns feels awkward at first, but gets easier with practice"" in particular was very heavily emphasised in my first email and in the links.

So, um... what do I tell them now? They're good people, pretty liberal, just... old? fairly sheltered? convinced they can't understand the modern world so why try? 

Has anyone found any links or resources that work well for older generations? I know the generation gap can be so huge sometimes that what seems perfectly clear to younger people is incomprehensible to people in their 60s.

It is I, another person who isn't sure if they're cis, and I'd like to talk to some nonbinary folks to see if I can find a place I belong.

I've been into cosplaying androgynous/NB people since I was in high school, so expressing myself through costumes isn't new to me. I just never really considered myself (like my essence I guess?) to be either male or female, despite having a female body. I know I'm not trans, although I did wonder if I was back in high school. I think I decided I liked my body to make any hormonal changes (this would have never been okay in my house anyway.)  


I feel like I also may not ""get"" to be non-binary. I'm bisexual and married to a cis man. I'm pretty female presenting. I'm pear shaped. I don't feel like I look good in masculine clothing because of my hips, so I usually just opt feminine fashion. My daily is a t-shirt and jeans. I also have fibromyalgia, so expressing myself though dressing up isn't always an option.

As an experiment, I put ""she/her/they/them ok!"" in my Twitter profile and it felt good.  


I recently went on a trip with someone who used all pronouns and wore a packer when they felt like it. I was kind of jealous. My trans friend told me that jealousy/envy of others is a big tell in her community.

Last night, I had a dream that I was pointing to where I belonged on a spectrum and I was in between female and neutral.  


Since then, it feels like I have a squirming snake in my chest.

I'm sorry, this is mostly word vomit. I'm just trying to figure things out.

I decided to take a closer look on detransitioning, and the permanent things from T and the ""returning"" things from E seem *exactly* like what id want from a transition.

I dont think this is about transitioning just to detransition after, its more an unusual transition process.

I might even not stop it, but thats up to my future self to know which dominant hormone makes me feel better.

I've been figuring out gender stuff for a short while, possibly about a year at this point. I've more or less always been a very butch person, but went through a long awkward femme phase in college, when I met my current partner of 8 years. We just celebrated our 4th wedding anniversary in July.

This last June I tearfully came out as trans, though I'm still figuring out if I want to ever pursue HRT, I know that I definitely want top surgery.

My name is Ezra Morris and I am a graduate student from the psychology department at Towson University. I am writing to invite you to participate in a research study about the subtle positive and negative messages received during therapy/counseling as experienced by those with a gender identity that differs from which they were assigned at birth.

If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to recount both subtle positive and negative experiences that you have had in therapy/counseling because of your gender identity. Contact information for emotional support services will be provided at the end of the survey, should you need them.

In order to participate, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a gender identity that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth. In addition, you must have attended therapy/counseling within the last 5 years while identifying as a gender (or lack thereof) that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth, or while exploring your gender identity. Your gender identity does NOT have to be the reason for/focus of your attendance.

Participation is completely voluntary and should take about 10 minutes to complete. If you have any questions about the study, please contact me at [kmorri27@students.towson.edu](mailto:kmorri27@students.towson.edu), message me here, or leave a comment. This study has received approval by the institutional review board at Towson University.

I am frustrated because of the current situation im the Hambacher Forst. If you haven't heard of it, it is basically a forest which is on a property that has been owned by a coal mining company (RWE) for more than 40 years, and when they aquired it coal was huge and tjey got a contract about owning the entire territory. They have already cut down most of the forest and turned into a huge hole. They have also forced residents in several villages around the forest to move. They gave them housing elsewhere, but still, their home is destroyed, and the government allows this because, well, coal money. The forest is very old and beautiful and there are plant and animal species in it who are threatened to go extinct. So some activists have been occuopying the remains of the forest for 6 years now, to protect it. They live in tree houses and the forest has become a space for all sorts of people where they can just exist, teach each other skills, discuss, sing and live in peace. Also there are a lot of nonbinary people there, since the community is so accepting. But now the government has ordered the police to evict everyone and destroy the tree houses. For more than two weeks now, the whole territory was circled by police and people were randomly searched for ""dangerous items"" such as brushes, ropes and fire extinguishers. (actual examples of what was confiscated). There was a lot of fake news on the media too, some of which was corrected. They maintained things like that activists had erected burning barricades, or that they had dug a tunnel system from which they were to attack police when the forest is evicted. This was complete bs and made up to make the activists look dangerous and crazy.
Yesterday, the government ordered the police to chase everyone out, for ""fire safety reasons"". After taking away their fire extinguishers. Today a lot of activists were already escorted out. Tree houses were destroyed and the first trees were cut down. 
It just makes me so sad. The people who live there have created something so beautiful. It was experimental, peaceful, accepting, and a lot of people got to live as their true self there. They created fascinating art there, tree houses, taught each other life skills. It was so nice and nothing like the image the media paints of it. It makes me so angry that we don't get to live as ourselves in our day-to-day lives. This was a place of freedom. Why does the government not see that this is very important to a lot of people? There are big rallies against it every day now, people are protesting all over Germany. It is not even clear yet if RWE will be allowed to mine and burn the coal because there are several lawsuits going on. 
I am just so sad and frustrated that this is taken away from us and from the planet. Having been there a lot, I can not stop wondering what life could be like if everyone could live as accepting and caring as these environment activists. The government could force RWE to close all the coal plants because they are older than 25 years and therefore unsafe. But no. Coal profits are more important that humans, the environment, and the beautiful community that has existed there for 6 years now.

My struggle ISN'T about my gender expression btw. What's hard is telling other people I'm non-binary. Explaining to them I'm both male and female (I'm androgyne) because it isn't something they believe that exists. It's really hard to communicate something the rest can't wrap their heads around it.

I've been trying identifying as a feminine boy socially, believing it'd give me enough room to be myself, but doing so felt so wrong that it made me feel dysphoric, so it didn't work for me. So I need to be open about my gender in order to be fully myself. It' something I HAVE to do, regardless of the consequences. So I wanted to hear your experiences regarding this in specific.

It's really hard to communicate something the rest can't wrap their heads around it.\n\nI've been trying identifying as a feminine boy socially, believing it'd give me enough room to be myself, but doing so felt so wrong that it made me feel dysphoric, so it didn't work for me. So I need to be open about my gender in order to be fully myself. It' something I HAVE to do, regardless of the consequences. So I wanted to hear your experiences regarding this in specific.\n\n\nThanks in advance! &lt;3"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Experiences living openly as non-binary', 'created': 1537060130.0}"

I'm feeling really isolated in my new town with no non-binary folks in sight so far and I need some help. 

I'm not doing too well considering I have 2 allies that gender me correctly out of  the hundreds of people that I work with in my educational and professional careers daily. 

Does anybody know of any additional resources (apps/platforms) similar to reddit that offer opportunities to have conversations with non binary folks, get advice from them, and allow people to just be themselves without judgment of gender identity?

In addition to that, any advice from folks who are experiencing/experienced a similar situation?

Thanks in advance!

""It's weird to look at old pictures. At this point I can recognize that I looked conventionally ""pretty"" and in some ways miss that, but I also know that when I was younger I felt so miserable in my body and detached from it.

My body was my enemy and I never felt good enough, and no matter how I dressed or how much makeup I wore, I felt like my body was betraying the way I felt inside. I always wanted to be ""one of the guys"" and I ""wasn't like other girls."" I wanted to fit in but I also felt like I never would.

It's wild how different I feel now. 90% of the time I'm completely comfortable with myself and I like the way I look. I don't care what other people think of my appearance. I never thought I would be able to acheive that when I was younger. I always thought I would finally be happy with myself if I was thinner, prettier, if my skin was a little clearer, etc.

Now I recognize that most of my feelings stemmed from physical and social dysphoria. I didn't feel like ""other girls"" because I'm not a girl. I didn't ""fit in with the boys"" because I'm not a guy. I identify as nonbinary and use ""they/them/theirs"" pronouns instead of ""she/her/hers"" or ""he/him/his."" Some of you may already know or may have guessed, but I've never made a formal announcement because it makes me nervous. Most media and public perception about nonbinary people is negative.

I've felt this way for many years. I remember wishing I was born a boy when I was around 8. I used to pray before bed that I could wake up a boy. It doesn't have anything to do with my interests, my appearance, or who I'm attracted to, just the way I innately feel. Now that there are more resources around gender identity, I've realized that ""man"" doesn't fit as much as ""woman"" doesn't fit. I am nonbinary.

Anyway, I didn't intend for this to be a long or dramatic post. I've been mulling over posting for a while (like 2-3 years while) and feel like there's no real point in waiting anymore.

Sorry if it's a bit of a mess. 

I believe myself to be somewhat rational, for the most part.

I was born a female. I know what's down there.
I was always a bit of a tomboy. This doesn't affect your gender, yes, but I still believe it to be an important piece of evidence.

At age 11-12, I can't pin down an exact point, I started to question myself. Mainly, my femininity. I didn't like being a girl. I never was into the ""normal"" female things. Being a male felt more natural, but still a bit off. After a bit of research, I learned of being non-binary, specifically, to be neither gender. Finally, I found something that felt right.

Now, I know that just because I wasn't a girly-girl isn't grounds for transitioning, my feelings went beyond that. When I was called she, it made my chest feel tight. Wearing feminine clothes was about the most uncomfortable thing I could do. 
Months later, I finally convinced my mother to let me get a shorter haircut, and it was as if a piece of me had been restored. I started wearing more neutral/male leaning clothes, and I felt better.

Though outwardly I did all this, I was still in the closet. I had told my mother, but we more or less swept it under the rug. She still used my birth name and pronouns. I didn't mind, as I felt coming out at such a young age was a bad idea. I at least had the insight to know that it could have been just a phase. 

Fast forward to age 15. I had been living with these thoughts of transitioning for nearly 3-4 years. It nearly drove me mad. I was stuck. I dressed neutral, had a short haircut, and strangers even called me by male pronouns or neutral they/them. It was nice, but I wanted more. I wanted people to call me they/them, and I wanted to be called by a different name. 
I can say for sure I wasn't an SJW. Even online, if people referred to me as a female, I didn't go nuts. I felt mature enough to handle being transgender, but I had no clue how to come out to my peers, the rest of my family, and to have my mother be on board. 

I asked to get counseling. I assumed it would help me by either letting me live with these feelings, make them go away, or to help me come out.
Needless to say, it didn't. 
While my counselor was a lovely woman, she basically told me to just find peace where I was. I had been where I was for 4 years. There was no hope of peace.

Fast forward again, into highschool. Everyone knew something was up. Substitutes called me 'sir', people saw the way I dressed. It was hard to keep quiet. I was so close to having my secret out, it just needed to be confirmed. Still, my mother and I never discussed it, and when we did, she always told me to keep it in.

Now, at age 17, living with this for 6 years, I'm ready to come out.
I want to be known as they/them (though if people referred to me as a female, it wouldn't bug me. I just want to come out of the closet.)

Here, though, if my question.
Should I come out?
Is being non-binary something bad? I hear the term 'special snowflake' a lot.
How should I go about this? How do I live with this?

I felt mature enough to handle being transgender, but I had no clue how to come out to my peers, the rest of my family, and to have my mother be on board. \n\nI asked to get counseling. I assumed it would help me by either letting me live with these feelings, make them go away, or to help me come out.\nNeedless to say, it didn\'t. \nWhile my counselor was a lovely woman, she basically told me to just find peace where I was. I had been where I was for 4 years. There was no hope of peace.\n\nFast forward again, into highschool. Everyone knew something was up. Substitutes called me \'sir\', people saw the way I dressed. It was hard to keep quiet. I was so close to having my secret out, it just needed to be confirmed. Still, my mother and I never discussed it, and when we did, she always told me to keep it in.\n\nNow, at age 17, living with this for 6 years, I\'m ready to come out.\nI want to be known as they/them (though if people referred to me as a female, it wouldn\'t bug me. I just want to come out of the closet.)\n\nHere, though, if my question.\nShould I come out?\nIs being non-binary something bad? I hear the term \'special snowflake\' a lot.\nHow should I go about this? How do I live with this?\n\nTl;dr I have known I\'m trans for 6 years, and I don\'t know what to do.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Young Non-Binary needing help.', 'created': 1537141241.0}"

One of the club members that I have written about in the story, lets call them 'Dan', has been out as non binary for 6 months or so. I have spoken to them before about it, and when I did Dan was still called Diane and when I asked about their pronouns they said: 'use 'she' or 'he', it doesn't really matter to me.' and because I was used to calling them 'she' and 'her', I continued to do so, although occasionally not correcting myself when I would use male pronouns and I noticed they appreciate that. I did use 'she' and 'her' in the story.  


Two weeks ago, I heard that Dan had changed their name. So that has changed, and I am anxious whether their preferred pronouns have changed also. But we don't speak one on one, so I would have to send a message in which I ask for pronouns. Would that be okay?

The thing that has complicated this issue is that I'm genderfluid myself but not out and still figuring things out, so I might have been overthinking this a LOT. I also have a good friend that is a transman that I do talk to regularly, but I don't even dare to ask him because the reason why I cannot be casual with this is that it is a heavy subject for myself also.

I‚Äôve come to realize a lot of fears such as getting too much breast growth have gone away the more I thought about things. Pros of HRT def outweigh the cons for me.

At this point I'm excited about almost every aspect of feminization that comes from HRT...but there is one thing I keep getting stuck up on the closer I get to transition.

Anyway. Looking for hrt experiences of AMAB nb folk and ofc if anyone went through this same fear how did things turn out etc? Did you face change a lot, a little? How did you navigate things if it did turn too feminine.

English ""lacks"" a third-person singular pronoun, or so we've all heard. Many neopronouns have been proposed (and some people like them) but a lot of people have taken to using ""they"", as ""they"" as a third person singular pronoun standing in for someone who's gender is unknown or ambiguous is already unconsciously in general usage, no matter how much prescriptivists like to deny it.

""They"" is all well and good. I like ""they"". However I was reading a book with two non-gendered protagonists and it did become confusing as to whether both of the protagonists were being talked about, and if it was only one, which one. We can chalk some of this up to poor editing but it is still a unique problem to the usage of ""they"" as a personal pronoun and one we're probably going to run into as more and more people assert themselves as non-binary and choose to use ""they"".

So I was thinking... there actually *is* a third person singular pronoun in English, one that is in general usage, it's just used incredibly rarely and is classified as indefinite. And that is the pronoun ""one"". Even though it's labeled as a third person singular pronoun its usage is currently entirely impersonal... when using ""one"", one is generally talking about a hypothetical non-gendered person and in informal settings you'd likely default to using ""you"" for this hypothetical person.

The original concept a White Boy came up with for a d&amp;d campaign and it was awash with your typical patriarchal bullshit like rape and power-amassing villains, etc. The campaign fell apart quickly due to the aforementioned White Boy's incompetence. I ended up doing a lot of the work on the actual world building, so when all was said and done I still had this outline for a world that I felt had a lot of potential. So I stripped out everything I didn't like and thought about what I would want my ""ideal"" world to look like, and a lot of it kept coming back to getting rid of things like the gender binary, toxic- masculinity and monogamy as well as rape culture. First and foremost, everyone has autonomy over their own bodies, both to eliminate rape as a widely accepted occurrence (example: half-orcs)  and letting women chose who / when / or even if they procreate. By default, those who can procreate often end up in positions of power because they wield the most important power of all, the literal power of life. Also, sex work is and has always been a thing, it's literally the oldest profession so it's going to be in my world, but of course their work isn't illegal or frowned upon.  

&amp;#x200B;

One of the ideas I had was never referring to any of the children or babies with genders or pronouns, and was thinking there would be some sort of ""coming of age"" ceremony where perhaps they would pick a gender / name, etc. I would also like to enter the ""two-spirit"" concept into my world, and one of the main characters is a non-binary half-orc. BUT I am trying to be consciously aware not to rip cultural stuff from Native Americans, since I keep coming back to some of these things in their culture I think just make sense for my world, especially in the further out villages where community is very important. 

&amp;#x200B;

The hardest part is obviously the ""show not tell"" reveal; as in when my characters interact what are the societal norms established in a non-binary world? Would you ask pronouns right away or in a non-binary world would pronouns even be a thing? Would literally everyone just be referred to as ""they""?? What about gendering animals?  ARGH. it's seriously making me crazy how freaking gendered everything is in my head and it's massively bogging down my writing. for example, gods / goddesses exist in the world's pantheon, but am aware these are very gendered terms. I thought of just referring to all of them as gods, but honestly I like the word 'goddess' so much and would like for that to mean something as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm also looking for gender neutral terms I can use. I only have a few things I've already decided I like; ""Ser"" instead of ""sir"" (and in this case it refers to military rank, not gender) and would like to use the term ""folx"" as a catch all phrase to address groups of people. Are there any other typically gendered terms that you have a better word for?? Like I've seen 'fortify' instead of man-up, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay I'm probably rambling and I still feel like I've done a poor job trying to explain why I'm posting on here. Basically I just want to touch base with some non-binary people and ask if there is anything else I should be thinking about making sure I do or don't do.

358,2018-09-22 20:13:40,9i2ozi,13,41,"Hey y'all,

Heads up, this is going to get long and ranty. So. One of the things that's most frustrating for me in my transitioning process is that I can't for the life of me decide whether I want to try/start HRT or not. I've been back and forth all the time every day for over a year on it now. And I feel like one of the factors that exacerbates the problem the most, and makes me feel even crazier, is how incredibly few examples there are in pop culture of nonbinary AMAB artists or celebrities who are known for something other than queer/trans/gender activism but are vocal about being nonbinary, compared to AFAB celebrities who fit the same description.

For most of my life I really didn't give two shits about pop culture, and obviously it all should be taken with a heaping dose of salt, but it feels bleak and frustrating to me how clear the message seems to be that if you ""choose"" an identity-path that means throwing away power and privilege rather than gaining it, then there will be no place for you in society as far as the people who hold power over our biggest cultural-media industries are concerned. It's striking to me that with the recent wave of celebrities regarded by the public eye as ""women"" who have come forward about there nonbinary identities, there has been no parallel wave among public figures who are treated as ""men.""

I don't like that talking about public perception means I have to divide people based on their birth-assigned gender just because other people do, but I feel like that's unfortunately the clearest way to get at what I'm trying to say. In the AFAB camp you've got actors like Ruby Rose, Amandla Stenberg, and Asia Kate Dillon, all of whom have talked publicly about their gender identities; musicians like Angel Haze and Miley Cyrus who have done the same; also musicians like St. Vincent and Grimes, who haven't been quite as clear-cut in their language about themselves as persons but have talked about seeking gender-neutral or -ambiguous or -fluid spaces in/through their work.

And then in the AMAB camp you've got... Eddie Izzard. Who is endlessly endearing and whose comedy I adored in high school, but he is fifty-six entire years old and comes from another time. I guess Sam Smith, based on a single comment he made a year or so back? Shamir. Shamir, along with Sam Smith, is more on the same vibe with St. Vincent and Grimes, I suppose, in that they've essentially voiced how deeply *not* important gender is to their work. Whereas Eddie Izzard is more of an Amandla or an Asia. But he is not young like those latter two, who are, significantly, super duper young. And whereas there are more public figures I left off the AFAB list, these three AMAB people are literally the only ones I can think of.

I don't doubt that young artists who are unapologetically vocal about their nonbinary identities and happen to have been AMAB are out there doing great work, but it seems like their industries won't reward them in the same way, because their paths don't fit into marketable pop-pseudo-feminist narratives of (*ble**ughhh here it comes...*) ""female"" ""empowerment."" So I guess my question is, whose work should I be paying attention to? What young, creative minds are putting art out there that's worthy of the top of the industry but isn't getting the reach it could have because of who made it?

All this said, the visibility of nonbinary people who *have* gone on HRT (and, again, are known primarily for something other than gender activism or queer activism) is of course even less, regardless of GAAB. I feel like in broad strokes the same principle is operating here ‚Äî in the mainstream reading of it, ""changing"" your gender means you're throwing away your inborn/God-given power or potential and that's something not to be desired ‚Äî but this could be a subject for a whole other post and isn't really what I'm trying to get into right now.

Basically, in trying to feel out what I want for myself in my own transition, I feel perpetually thrown off by the dearth of examples or role models to look to who have taken a path I'm considering. It's not that I'm interested in copying anybody else's journey. I just have found myself relating strongly to nonbinary celebrities when they talk about their gender identity as something that *is* significant to them ‚Äî but, except for one who is old enough to be my parent, none of those people have come from the type of upbringing I've come from. It's disheartening. It just is.

IDK, am I wrong? Do I have a confirmation bias someone can call me out on? Where the fuck are we??

I never got to have therapy and therefore HRT, so I'm still stuck with this male body. For a while after I broke up with my ex, due to literally feeling imprisoned by the ""female role"" I had in the relationship, I thought I was asexual, but I am definitely still sexually attracted to females...or maybe I'm just jealous? Maybe it's part of the dysphoria I keep feeling? But even when I'm alone with him, free to be me, with no mask, I don't really feel female ""enough"" either to consider myself that. But I'd absolutely love to wear the female clothes he and I bought for me over the last few years.

I don't know what I wanna be once I get to break out of my shell... I'm too old to be a girl, to tall to still be cute compared to my ridiculous standards of what I love about female bodies... I can't even figure out who my ideal partner would be, for me to ever consider trying a relationship. I think I need someone more dominant, who'd push me towards actually working on changing things for the better and could help me with body care, make up and such. I've been daydreaming about that a bit, I think I might even consider them my owner if they let me live as their catgirl.

Is it wrong that I could have sex with a female, but hate my dick otherwise? Maybe that's just these stupid hormones telling me that I want sex, when I tried it with him that just satisfied my curiousity pretty much forever, so it might be that all over again, just with maybe a bit more to explore? Idk, I'm not cutting my claws tho... ~~and I'm a stupid pillow princess with back pain as an excuse~~

Not that I know how to get out of this limbo state I'm in, I literally wouldn't know the words to say even if I managed to find and call a new therapist and my mom can't get a hold of the only one who ever seriously talked to me without any bias (and therefore applying their experience to me, which just doesn't work like that). I just can't deal with stuff alone and nobody's here to help me, especially once my ex goes back home next week ;-;

I wish I could just buy a new body, maybe even with cat ears and no disgusting body hair...this one got ruined by growth hormone therapy beta testing anyways, boobs would probably make the back pain even worse...ugh...but being able to pass as female would make wearing female clothes much easier and that's what I really want right now, I think. Maybe actually having a female body would allow me to feel something gender-related again. For now I mostly feel nothing and can't describe what I feel when I'm with him, but it *is* something...

Usually I'd also be crying for attention and hugs, headpats and such, but my ex is here and happy to provide me that...even tho I secretly feel like an asshole for basically using him for that, even tho we broke up.

I haven't even directly mentioned my anxieties (spelling?) about a lot of these things. One big issue I have are my grandparents who I usually see every day, but I feel like they wouldn't understand, my grandpa is already annoyed at my long hair that I've had for years (inb4 r/egg_irl) and my claws... but it's all I have, I'm not happy with my legs and keep losing the war against this stupid body hair...especially if I keep randomly falling back into not doing anything anymore and becoming nocturnal again.

I hate giant walls of text, if anyone read all of this...thank you...a lot. People who listen to me rant about my problems are a big part of why I'm still alive at all.

Long story short : still live with parents, bought a binder, eventually parent found out, threw out my binder, several months after many, many, talks with parent, they've decided that if i lose weight then i can have permission with my own money to buy a binder. Situation still a bit shitty, but hey i take what i can get. 

Issue though is having to wait until ive lost enough weight that they can deem i can have a binder, because theyre convinced i only have dysphoria because im fat. Which im not gonna deny, i am fat. Ive actually lost 9 pounds now. But im still having heavy chest dysphoria, and my biggest fear is that if i do get another binder, my chest will still show. My other binder didnt hide all my chest, but it did cut down my dysphoria, and i dont know why, but im afraid im going to lose weight and still be able to see my chest with a binder and still be uncomfortable with myself. 

Additionally, bottom dysphoria sucks too. I dont get it as often, but damn it *sucks*. And it confuses the fuck out of me too. Like with chest dysphoria i know that i actually want no chest, and one day i wanna get top surgery. Ive thought about it a lot (well kinda half to when its always on your mind) and ive read up a lot of the subject, ive never felt comfortable with my chest, and i know about my feeling about my chest. 

But bottom dysphoria really fucks up my head. Like everything down there just starts to feel so foreign and wrong, so whats the opposite to that? Do i want a penis? Do i want a vagina? Why cant i have neither? Fuck. Its like everything downstairs just shouldn't be. Usually i just sleep in boxers, (and let me tell you that if your reading this and also having bottom dysphoria, try wearing a different type of underwear, boxers makes it easier than boy shorts) but on nights where bottom dysphoria is bad i wear pants, which isnt that bad, but when im having bad chest dysphoria i sleep in a hoodie, so most nights im sleeping like fully clothed and its hot as fuck.  Looking into getting another fan for my room tho. 

Dysphoria also fucks me over with all these questions. Like i know i dont want to be a girl, but does that necessarily mean i want to be a dude? And i thought i had this all figured out that i could just ve nonbinary and be neither, but bottom dysphoria just fucked me up being like ""well if you dont want a vagina and you dont want a penis, what's your plan?

Usually i just sleep in boxers, (and let me tell you that if your reading this and also having bottom dysphoria, try wearing a different type of underwear, boxers makes it easier than boy shorts) but on nights where bottom dysphoria is bad i wear pants, which isnt that bad, but when im having bad chest dysphoria i sleep in a hoodie, so most nights im sleeping like fully clothed and its hot as fuck.  Looking into getting another fan for my room tho. \n\nDysphoria also fucks me over with all these questions. Like i know i dont want to be a girl, but does that necessarily mean i want to be a dude? And i thought i had this all figured out that i could just ve nonbinary and be neither, but bottom dysphoria just fucked me up being like ""well if you dont want a vagina and you dont want a penis, what\'s your plan? Are you just gonna fill it up with cement down there?"" \n\nSeriously fuck dysphoria.', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Dysphoria sucks.', 'created': 1537797519.0}"

It's currently a very stressful and confusing time in my life as I'm sure it is for most of us here. I've found myself alone and confused in London starting my university course, working part time, and also trying to figure out my gender identity.

It's taken me years to admit to myself that I've been living a lie, and now that I am at least seeking professional help I feel like the person I want to be isn't just a dream anymore.

However life is never straightforward and I've learnt that I'm likely going to be waiting for 18-24 months till I get my first appointment with the gender identity clinic in London. With my disphoria growing all the time and feeling like the world could come crashing down on me at any moment, I'm not sure that's a wait I can handle.

But what can I do? There's only two clinics in the whole country and I have to be seen by them before they'll prescribe me hormones &gt;_&lt;

So my question for anyone willing to answer is. What are my options, do any of you know ways to speed up or divert this process? Or if not, ways to help me get through this wait?

Hey everyone, this is my first post to this sub. I realized I was NB about a year ago, and it's been a really positive discovery on my life, but I'm still very much struggling on how to present myself. I'm mostly out, but not to everyone and especially not to family/faculty/etc. So right now I'm still presenting masculine, but I want to start changing that.

&amp;#x200B;

One of the issues I've been facing is that, while I really dislike ""men's"" clothing (as in, clothes you find in the men's section at a store) and find it boring and restrictive, I'm not comfortable wearing ""women's"" clothing either (excluding basics like jeans, shirts, hoodies; I more mean dresses, skirts, etc.), and I really can't find an in-between. I've searched in vain for inspiration around the web, but what I'm finding all seems pretty redundant: hats, vests, ties/bow ties, denim jackets; nothing feels like my style and everything in general feels too masc.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm running into a specific issue in the last few days: My college is having a large formal dance event next month, and I'm determined to find a formal outfit that isn't a suit or tux. But when I look online, all I find is vests, ties, and suit pants; everything once again feels way too masc. It's also not helping my dysphoria at all: the images that come up when I search for NB formal wear are people wearing suits that have softer face features than I do. It's making me feel really stuck in how I present.

&amp;#x200B;

This is mostly just a rant I guess, but I do have a question for anyone who feels like they've been in a similar place. Does anyone have advice for clothes/styles that don't seem to be on any spectrum, and are just truly androgynous? Outside of basic jeans, shirts (which is all I feel comfortable wearing right now), has anyone found clothes that, in your perspective, really don't feel masculine or feminine, but just feel like their own thing? Especially for formal wear, I would love to find something that is really unique, even if it means that it looks like runway art-fashion. Any advice is welcome.

399,2018-09-24 20:05:23,9ilc44,3,4,"Hello fellow enbies,

This will be long and rambly and propably trigger people with eating disorders, so be warned.

I have recently realized I am nb (although it was pretty obvious, but I took long to come to terms with it. I have been dressing and behaving very androgynously all my life, and never felt like I fit right in with either girls or boys; back when I was 11 my peers called me 'neutral' and my mom forced me to get my ears pierced so I would be reckognized as female, so there we go, rambling already.)

Now some things just make perfect sense to me, which did not make sense before. There is one particular aspect of my life which I am very ashamed of and that is my obsession with my body fat. 

Which never made sense to me. Like, WHY do I feel so uncomfortable with having fat on my body, when body fat doesn't make other people look unattractive to me? I am bisexual and I have just always LOVED curvy, chubby, feminine girls, they are so beautiful. And guys, too. A big cuddly guy with a soft tummy to cuddle? HELL yeah. 
So why the FUCK am I so obsessed with my own body fat? Why the fuck am I SO uncomfortable if I even gain a bit of weight? I have always felt ashamed of that. Like, I felt like it makes me so shallow and like a hypocrite when I told others to not worry about being thin. But it is not the same thing. I just can't stand my hips and breasts because I do not want to be seen as feminine or even female. If I saw another person with my exact figure, I would see them as a very attractive female, but I am not a female so I don't feel comfortable with that.  

The only way for me to feel comfortable and confident in my body is to restrict my food intake and to and train A LOT so I don't have a lot of body fat. (and also, to have visible muscles. I love having defined muscles). Again, I do NOT hold anyone else up to that standard, and I find other people way more attractive when they are soft and chubby rather that thin and muscular. But somehow when it is ME I am looking at, I have a completely different set of ""beauty standards"".


At least I know now why that is, right? Because my fat distribution makes me feel dysphoric af and I prefer myself as  a non-genderable stick with a bit of badass muscle?


But how do I overcome that though? This is SO exhausting! I don't want to live like that for the rest of my life? I can only maintain a figure I am comfortable with if I seriously restrict my eating and train a lot, but I can not always do that. Right now I am in a stressful situation, and I need all my brain power, so I can not afford to not eat (makes me have a hard time concentrating). Also, I have been sick for nearly 2 weeks now and could not exercise. I NEED to become healthy right now, or else I will fuck up my exams. So I eat. A lot, in my mind, even though I know it is actually a healthy amount of food. But this means I am heavier than normal, and I hate that so much. Unfortunately, maintaining the body I feel comfortable with takes so much time and discipline, and I have to sacrifice my health, my well-being, my sleep for it. I can not go on like that. What do I do now?

415,2018-09-25 13:05:03,9irxpa,6,19,"I've been on T for over 2 years, had a hysto, planning on bottom surgery sometime soon. I have felt incredibly secure in my identiy since coming out, until now.

I have become somewhat obsessed with a musician who is a cis woman. I tend to do this, become obsessive over people or things. but she is the type of person I would love to be -- beautiful, artistic..I envy her voice, her appearance, her hair, her sense of style. if I were a woman, she is the type of woman I would want to be.

this is confusing to me, because I am most often attracted to men. the last time I felt any sort of attraction to a woman was years ago, and I was coming to terms with just being a gay man until I saw this musician in-person.

so I couldn't decide whether I was attracted to her, or whether I wanted to be her.

I never felt comfortable as a woman, but now I'm thinking, was it just because I thought I was unattractive? I hated my hair, the way my body looked and felt to me, although I certainly feel more comfortable being unattractive presenting as a masculine person than a woman, but often it is more societally accepted to be unattractive as a man than a woman.

thing is, this past two years since I've been on hormones have been the best two years of my life so far. I've made friends, I got a college degree, I finally feel like a human being and not a depressed blob. now I feel myself slipping back into depression.

I think part of my insecurities come from not feeling like I shouldn't have transitioned, but from feeling like if I were ever to meet this woman, she'd be repulsed by me, a tiny man. maybe what I'm feeling is internalized transphobia.

because then, when I think, what if I woke up the next morning in this woman's body? the only way I could deal with it would be if I covered it up. she tends to wear modest clothing, clothes that cover most of her body and obscure her figure. but actually being in a woman's body, that is not something I feel like I could ever deal with. the only way I could deal with being in a woman's body would be if it were, well, a more masculine woman's body, with no hips, the tiniest of boobs..

but I know my life would have been easier as a woman. even though I also know that, if I woke up in this woman's body feeling like I do now, I'd still need to transition, no matter how beautiful she is. because I couldn't deal with the bottom dysphoria or ignoring and hating my body the way I did until I realized I was trans. 

I think I've just been feeling depressed lately, and my fear of being rejected by people I admire due to the person I am is making me spiral a bit.

I am non-binary, so while I went on hormones and need surgeries to make my body feel more congruent with how I see myself in my mind, I feel now, more than ever, also more comfortable presenting in a more feminine way. pre-transition, I could never dress in feminine clothing because I felt like it accentuated the parts of my body that gave me distress. but now, I feel closer and more comfortable with my femininity than I ever could before. I feel increasing discomfort with being called ""bro"" or ""dude,"" I feel like my non-binary identity has never been acknowledged by anyone other than myself and it's causing me distress.

I needed to ramble on about this and now I feel a little better, but it'd still be nice to talk about it. I feel like I still experience a lot of negative feelings and internalized transphobia, and that I don't actually want to be this woman or any other woman. I think what I have realized is that I am not gay, I am attracted to all genders and my worry is that no one of any gender will ever find me worthy of attraction or love.

I guess i‚Äôm worried I transitioned out of hatred for who I was, although I can‚Äôt deny that no matter what, I feel much better now than I ever did before, even with these weird feelings

I'm wondering if anyone else here has ever felt this way.

I think my confusion mostly comes from feeling attracted to a woman after identifying as gay for a long time, thus bringing up old feelings of do I want to be this person, or be with them?

I hated my hair, the way my body looked and felt to me, although I certainly feel more comfortable being unattractive presenting as a masculine person than a woman, but often it is more societally accepted to be unattractive as a man than a woman.\n\nthing is, this past two years since I\'ve been on hormones have been the best two years of my life so far. I\'ve made friends, I got a college degree, I finally feel like a human being and not a depressed blob. now I feel myself slipping back into depression.\n\nI think part of my insecurities come from not feeling like I shouldn\'t have transitioned, but from feeling like if I were ever to meet this woman, she\'d be repulsed by me, a tiny man. maybe what I\'m feeling is internalized transphobia.\n\nbecause then, when I think, what if I woke up the next morning in this woman\'s body? the only way I could deal with it would be if I covered it up. she tends to wear modest clothing, clothes that cover most of her body and obscure her figure. but actually being in a woman\'s body, that is not something I feel like I could ever deal with. the only way I could deal with being in a woman\'s body would be if it were, well, a more masculine woman\'s body, with no hips, the tiniest of boobs..\n\nbut I know my life would have been easier as a woman. even though I also know that, if I woke up in this woman\'s body feeling like I do now, I\'d still need to transition, no matter how beautiful she is. because I couldn\'t deal with the bottom dysphoria or ignoring and hating my body the way I did until I realized I was trans. \n\nI think I\'ve just been feeling depressed lately, and my fear of being rejected by people I admire due to the person I am is making me spiral a bit.\n\nI am non-binary, so while I went on hormones and need surgeries to make my body feel more congruent with how I see myself in my mind, I feel now, more than ever, also more comfortable presenting in a more feminine way. pre-transition, I could never dress in feminine clothing because I felt like it accentuated the parts of my body that gave me distress. but now, I feel closer and more comfortable with my femininity than I ever could before. I feel increasing discomfort with being called ""bro"" or ""dude,"" I feel like my non-binary identity has never been acknowledged by anyone other than myself and it\'s causing me distress.\n\nI needed to ramble on about this and now I feel a little better, but it\'d still be nice to talk about it. I feel like I still experience a lot of negative feelings and internalized transphobia, and that I don\'t actually want to be this woman or any other woman. I think what I have realized is that I am not gay, I am attracted to all genders and my worry is that no one of any gender will ever find me worthy of attraction or love.\n\nI guess i‚Äôm worried I transitioned out of hatred for who I was, although I can‚Äôt deny that no matter what, I feel much better now than I ever did before, even with these weird feelings\n\nI\'m wondering if anyone else here has ever felt this way.\n\nI think my confusion mostly comes from feeling attracted to a woman after identifying as gay for a long time, thus bringing up old feelings of do I want to be this person, or be with them? I wonder if I could have achieved the level of contentment with my life I feel now if I hadn\'t pursued transition.

i thought i dressed pretty neutrally for my interview today and i wasn‚Äôt even binding but the guy still called me sir and he. last time this happened i just rolled with it but i hated trying to pass every day and i think also i got soft fired for being Gender Confusing. i would prefer to be out as using they pronouns but that‚Äôs not feasible in every work environment and failing that i would at least like to pass as female i guess just for the sake of not having to wear a binder every day. but if they hear me on the phone and then i show up in a skirt or whatever i‚Äôm worried about being subjected to misdirected transmisogyny and not getting hired üò•

&amp;#x200B;

I'm MtF and like for many trans people my end goal of transition was becoming basically cis. It was a very unhealthy obsession. I had to always measure myself against other women. First steps are easy, to look like them, to move like them, to talk like them.

&amp;#x200B;

But then a cis girl talks to me about sex and I freak out, since I have no idea how girls talk to each other about this stuff. What role do  they think they have in a relationship? For my whole life I've seen the  whole world from a patriarchal perspective and never had those forming  years as a teenage girl to find my place in it. Heck, after 3 years of  living as a women I still don't understand why girls want to be with  men, who are stronger than them, have a more privileged placed in  society and are too often potential abusers.

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is talk about a first period, which I never had and never will. Tampons, pads and comfort routine during menstruation are a part  of this secret women world I'll never be a part of. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then there is motherhood. I cried more than I could count because  I'll never be a mother. I don't even want kids anymore but still can't hear people talking about babies without experiencing trauma. 

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, SRS. I had my first appointment with a doctor and I'll have it done soon. Boy, is this one is a huge can of worms. I'll need to  regularly stretch it, because my body will reject it and try to heal  over it. I'll have to carefully and frequently wash it, because it  cannot clean itself like in cis women. I'll need to always use lube during sex, because there won't be any natural lubrication like in cis women. And what hurt me the most, I'll lack muscles controlling it, so  even on the surface it won't function the same.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how hard I'll try, I'll always be a worse cis women, there will be something that I lack or don't understand on emotional level. It  was devastating and drove me into a terrible depression. As an enby, it also caused suppression of my identity, so gradual that I honest to God forgot I was one. Only after therapy I remembered who I was and started to get better.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is a good ending to this story and I hope it'll be the ending for anyone, who was in the same dark place as I was. I just stopped worrying about being cis, which I'll never be, and embraced being trans, which I always was. Cis women have their own shared experiences and  shared thoughts. We, trans women, have ours.

&amp;#x200B;

I was trying to be accepted as one of them and even when I had that acceptance, I always felt like a stranger. I finally found peace when I realized i was one of us all along.

&amp;#x200B;

I take her with a grain of salt, as you should too. The discussion was about ADHD. Someone mentioned how it can have overlap with other mental health issues and I mentioned that there have been studies about overlap with PCOS and ADHD. Now, some of you may know how being trans and having such a condition can be hard, confusing, and frustrating. Some may not, but that's ok. Being trans has it's ups and downs, and other conditions just make those downs more sucky at times, but that's life. 

 If you're curious to the studies, simply google ""ADHD PCOS.""

Why is this relevant to this sub? Well, Im trans. I have ADHD and PCOS. Oh, and being both trans and having pcos can get confusing and frustrating. Essentially, you're struggling with you gender dysphoria and you discover that you have this medical condition that fucks with your sex hormones. Now, are your feelings about your gender no longer valid because you have a hormone disorder that increases androgen levels and decreases estrogen? If you didn't have it, would you feel the way you do or do you feel the way you do only because that's part of the disorder? Can a hormone imbalance essentially make someone trans? Am I no longer valid as a transperson? What about if this is an intersex condition? Are intersex people not valid in the trans community? Do they really count since they are technically not cis?

PCOS is very relevant to my trans experience. The above is a snapshot of some of things I struggled with in the past or present. 

Being mixed race resulted in me being rejected by both ethnic communities. So, when it comes to queer communities, is that something Im going to have to face here as well? Am I truly valid? The answer to myself is 'yes,' whereas the answer to naysayers is 'idgaf if you disagree. Imma be me'

I have started to suspect that I might be trans  last summer, I thought about it a lot for a few months, doing research etc.. and kind of conclude that Im just a masculine girl and stopped thinking about it until recently. I got a short haircut, felt very masculine, and this is coming back. (Oh and sorry for my poor English)

Some history about myself. My parents told me stories from when I was little, I refused to play with Barbies, wear dresses.. then later (6-10) I was a real tomboy, short hair, boy clothes, i lived in the countryside and played almost only with boys (and I still find it easier to befriend guys), people thought I was one and I was amused by it, but I was jealous that I couldn't do some stuff like being shirtless. I clearly remember having a dream where I had a penis and told my parents about it. (I guess I was a weird kid).

But then puberty hit, I started to dress more ""girly"" (because that's what you're supposed to do) and I hated shopping with my mom, couldn't find comfortable clothes in the girl section, I tried to be like the other girls but wasn't very good at it. I had a enormous lack of self confidence, especially with my image (I had a few difficult years where I had no friends and was constantly bullied, I was the ugly lonely kid, probably, still affect me in some ways). 
I discovered that I liked girls around 14 I guess, never was a big deal for me, felt natural.

I don't remember how and when I started to know about trans stuff, but I recognized myself in some aspects, not everything though, and that's where my doubts come from.
For example, I have pretty big breasts and it feels better wearing a sports bra to flatten it (not as much as I'd like to though), the normal bras feels weird but I still wear it sometimes because the other hurt my back. I don't hate them, just wish they were smaller so I can bind (I'm really thinking about buying a binder). I also don't hate my genitals but I wouldn't mind not having my periods and being able to pee standing! 
Concerning hrt, I can't even imagine having a deep voice or facial hair, I don't know how I feel about that. 

So it sounds like I don't really experience gender dysphoria, I'm not comfortable when people insist on how I am a girl, and so I should be like this, being called madam.. but that doesn't mean anything. I feel better with my hair short, more confident. I love wearing ""boy clothes"" with my sport bra, I would also like to try on men's underwear, but I don't know how to do it discretely.. I hate it when people (like my parents) tell me to try to be more feminine ""why don't you try makeup, I'm sure you would look great!"" ""Just for once wear a dress, I would be so happy"" that kind of thing.. but maybe I just hate everything girly because I disagree with what society wants women to be like..
I thought about non-binaries identities, and I guess agender would fit me best, but I'm not really comfortable with the word, feels like it's missing something.

Sorry I guess this is the typical kind of story that you see here all the time, but maybe this could help me see things clearer, just hearing stories about people in my situation. Do I look like an egg in denial?
Thanks for reading. And sorry if the paragraph are messed up I'm on the phone app.

24,2018-09-04 17:48:33,9cy024,7,29,"There's a bit more to the story...

I also posted this to the Whirlpool forum looking for an answer.

**TLDR version:** Does anyone know what BDM-Victoria considers to be acceptable reasons for a change of surname?

**Details:**

Hi, I'm a transgender woman who's been presenting full time now for over a year now. Last week I finally got around to putting in my name change application and I'm pretty excited about it. I didn't expect this email, however:

&gt;""During the assessment of your application, the reason you have provided for the change of name has been deemed unsatisfactory. You are requested to provide further clarity as to the reasons for the change of name, surname &gt;!censored!&lt;. Please complete a statutory declaration as to why you are requesting a change of name and any reasons behind the name you have nominated to change into.""

On my application, where I was asked to provide a reason for my name change, I simply put that I was transgender and no longer wish to be known by my former names. I can see that this reason doesn't necessarily line up with my desire to change my last name ‚Äì but as I didn't think it would be an issue I kept my answer short.

The long explanation is that I spent a long time looking at different names both first and last with only one suitable candidate that I wasn't 100% sold on, so I decided, at least for now, to stick with Dannii, which is what I've been called since starting my transition.

Dannii is already very close to my birth name, Daniel, and I was hesitant taking it on for that reason. I need some more distance from my old name. It makes me cringe every time I hear Dannii in conjunction with my last name. It isn't unusual for transgender people to change their surname as they make a fresh start.

Surnames are essentially genderless, but other than this, I'm honestly not sure what the big deal is, or even if it's a big deal at all. Do you really need a ""good"" reason, or is it that my given reason simply didn't line up? What if you just really didn't like your surname, would that be enough?

Anyway, I REALLY don't want to get my application denied, nor can I afford to go through the process again so I thought I'd come here to see how other trans-people in Victoria went about changing their last name or if anyone knows what BDM-Victoria considers to be acceptable reasons for a change of surname.

Thanks for your time,

Last week I finally got around to putting in my name change application and I\'m pretty excited about it. I didn\'t expect this email, however:\n\n&gt;""During the assessment of your application, the reason you have provided for the change of name has been deemed unsatisfactory. You are requested to provide further clarity as to the reasons for the change of name, surname &gt;!censored!&lt;. Please complete a statutory declaration as to why you are requesting a change of name and any reasons behind the name you have nominated to change into.""\n\nOn my application, where I was asked to provide a reason for my name change, I simply put that I was transgender and no longer wish to be known by my former names. I can see that this reason doesn\'t necessarily line up with my desire to change my last name ‚Äì but as I didn\'t think it would be an issue I kept my answer short.\n\nThe long explanation is that I spent a long time looking at different names both first and last with only one suitable candidate that I wasn\'t 100% sold on, so I decided, at least for now, to stick with Dannii, which is what I\'ve been called since starting my transition.\n\nDannii is already very close to my birth name, Daniel, and I was hesitant taking it on for that reason. I need some more distance from my old name. It makes me cringe every time I hear Dannii in conjunction with my last name. It isn\'t unusual for transgender people to change their surname as they make a fresh start.\n\nSurnames are essentially genderless, but other than this, I\'m honestly not sure what the big deal is, or even if it\'s a big deal at all. Do you really need a ""good"" reason, or is it that my given reason simply didn\'t line up?

Womanhood comes with the occurrence of a naturally female body, natural female puberty, female anatomy, in the vast majority of cases gynecological considerations like conditions pertaining to having a vagina, pregnancy, years spent actively preventing or actively seeking pregnancy, a menstrual cycle, breasts (no matter the size), a natural cocktail of hormones that cause their own set of tendencies and actual ""feelings"" of womanhood, etc.

I get physically disgusted at the sight of my male genitalia. I shave body hair. Sometimes I mistakenly wear female clothes and I like it. I feel comfortable when referred to as a woman socially.

Occasionally when I get horny (only every few days) or when I'm distracted I kinda tolerate being born a man, but I never LIKE it.

She went through a phase maybe six months ago where everything was entrenched in gender roles. Girls couldn‚Äôt be pirates. Myself and my Dad couldn‚Äôt vacuum, wash dishes. (‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt do it, who‚Äôs going to?‚Äù I asked. Never mind that my mother was the businesswoman and I can‚Äôt remember ever seeing her do either.) I was heartbroken, but I knew it couldn‚Äôt be innate, and my Dad and I eventually got it out of her that a father of a friend was filling her head with this bullshit. We talked to her, and her parents, and she‚Äôs way better now.


Today she finally asked me *questions* about it. I‚Äôve told her several times if she wants to ask, she can, but out of the blue today she just said, ‚ÄúWhy did you want to become a boy?‚Äù (amusingly, mid conversation about her male classmates, who sound like maniacs. Idk what their parents are doing. I understand your confusion, cuz.) I parroted the ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been a boy, it was everyone else who was confused or didn‚Äôt know,‚Äù that I say whenever she mentions that I ‚Äúused to be a girl,‚Äù and then she asked a question that I found much more exciting and interesting: ‚ÄúHow did you know?‚Äù


‚ÄúI just know.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHow do you know you‚Äôre a girl?‚Äù


She thought on this for a while, and then answered; ‚ÄúI have long hair. But you had long hair, how did you know?‚Äù


‚ÄúWell, everyone else thought I was a girl, so they told me I should have long hair. But I‚Äôve had short hair for a long time now. Besides, I know lots of boys with long hair. Your Uncle used to have long hair!‚Äù


She nodded at this, but still seemed kinda like she was grasping the concept. I added;


‚ÄúAlso, if you cut your hair short, you would still know you‚Äôre a girl, right?‚Äù 


She answered yes.


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly like that!‚Äù


I swear I saw her eyes light up like ‚ÄúOH!‚Äù


I love her so much, she‚Äôs always been a staunch defender of my pronouns and chosen name, the first to jump to correct someone. I‚Äôm just so happy we finally had a convo about it. If anyone else is struggling with younger family members, let them know you‚Äôre open to questions and give them time. They might surprise you.

I hope you don't mind me picking your brains a bit. I have a number of trans friends already, but many of them came out before I met them so I didn't really need to get used to ""new"" names and pronouns much (their new was always there, from my perspective). My (cis AFAB/31) older sibling (trans AMAB/33/she/they) just came out to my family as trans. They've still got some exploration to do in terms of gender, names, etc, so we're still in the very early days of this, and there could be multiple try-on names or pronouns in the coming months/years... And I've had my entire life to get used to the wrong ones. Consequently it feels like more of a big deal to get it right, be validating, not screw up their pronouns, etc. 

So... What do you wish your siblings knew when you came out to them? What gaffes did they make that might have been preventable? Feel free to focus on siblings who mean well and accept that you are the expert on your own gender (or not, if you want to vent - that's fine too).

I'm especially curious about the best way to handle talking about our shared history - many of our experiences together, I've experienced as times with my ""brother"" when he was a ""young boy,"" and I'm not sure how to handle the mismatch between the gender associated with those memories and the correct gender of the person as they understand it now.

My NP was exactly like this - I actually found it odd during the meeting that she didn't tell me to aspirate and I asked and she said ""well, yes, you can do that, but you'll almost never hit a vein if you're injecting in the right spot so it's kind of unnecessary."" so for my first couple of shots, I didn't. Nonetheless, I had always been a little paranoid about that scenario.

A couple weeks after my first shot, I was talking to another trans friend. He mentioned to me that he had developed a phobia of self-injecting ever since he pinned a vein and bled all down his leg and it freaked him out. He said he knew as soon as he stuck it in and started moving the plunger down that it was very wrong because it hurt way more than normal. sure enough, vein. he's lucky he only ended up pushing a minute amount before stopping. since then he always has his boyfriend inject him in the glute.

so about a month later, I was doing my shot. I jabbed in as usual but I noticed it hurt way more. I remembered what my friend had described. I pulled the plunger back and sure enough there was a bead of blood in there. I grabbed a cotton ball and held it there for a minute after withdrawing the needle + put a band-aid over the cotton ball keeping it still pressed against my skin in case the scab opened up and then re-stuck myself in a different spot (ideally should have used a fresh needle but I was running a little low on them - the new injection ended up going fine, not even bruised). if I hadn't already had my cotton balls and Band-Aids all at the ready I probably would have gotten a fair amount of blood on the floor, and if I had ignored the pain, not aspirated, and just injected anyway, who knows what would have happened (not good things)!

takeaways:

1. always aspirate, every time
3. always keep cotton balls/band-aids ready
2. your dose should still be good to inject even after aspirating a little blood - it's your own blood, it's only a biohazard to other people, not you. just try to squeeze as much of the blood out so you don't leave a nasty bruise. the blood stays in a little droplet at the bottom of the syringe since the medicine is oleaginous and it's easy to separate back off.
3. ideally use a new needle after sticking yourself because the tip actually dulls after using it once and needles are very cheap
4. don't panic, you can just try again, you won't die or even seriously injure yourself as long as you aspirate every time and don't be hasty.",trans,PSA for self-injection: always aspirate your syringe,1536939273.0,"{'created_utc': 1536914073, 'id': '9fqapd', 'num_comments': 20, 'score': 35, 'selftext': 'so I\'ve heard that a lot of doctors/NPs doing instructional visits for how to self-administer shots (be it for T or for E - that\'s actually irrelevant in this case) neglect to teach you to aspirate the needle backwards before pushing the plunger down. \n\nMy NP was exactly like this - I actually found it odd during the meeting that she didn\'t tell me to aspirate and I asked and she said ""well, yes, you can do that, but you\'ll almost never hit a vein if you\'re injecting in the right spot so it\'s kind of unnecessary."" so for my first couple of shots, I didn\'t.

I still have a photo of us on our first day of highschool, at a junior high dance, playing dnd at my birthday party, etc..
Point is, this guy is a pretty solid fixture in my life. He's weird, and I may not like it sometimes, but he's my rock. He's always there to tell me to get off my ass when I fall down. 

Recently, as I came out a couple months ago, I've been attempted to present as a female. He was fine with my coming out, but is seemingly *not* fine with my new demeanor and appearance. He refuses to use my preferred name and pronouns. His reasoning being he met me as ""the boy"" not ""the girl"". It's weird for him to suddenly start calling me a girl, he says, which I understand. 

More alarmingly, he's said some pretty hurtful things to me. Like when I wore makeup the first time at school, he looked at me and asked, ""What's that faggot shit on your face?"". He's said similar comments about different things as well. Maybe he's joking, but it still *really* hurts. Especially coming from my best friend. I see him every day at school and at work, and I don't know what to do, because now all I can think about when I see him is how he'll probably think I'm a freak when I transition.

198,2018-09-20 15:57:08,9hggbg,11,30,"Idk where to begin tbh. Just a forewarning, I suck at TLDRs so if this ends up becoming a long thread I apologize, but I appreciate it if you take your time reading this.

Only just a few months ago, I came to the conclusion that I am bi. I am AMAB 21. It was difficult to accept even though I never have had any dislike towards the LGBT community. Since then I had questioned my gender. Was I really a man? Were there any signs I might have missed out on? These thoughts had me confused for quite some time as I was trying to figure things out. Even now, after saying to myself I am NB, do I still feel cognitive dissonance about it.

I‚Äôll be honest, I took those ‚Äúwhat gender am I‚Äù quizzes to see if that would help. Whether I did it to confirm my own feelings, I cannot say for certain. The answer I got felt - right. And yet I can‚Äôt shake the notion I might be lying to myself. I currently identify as Androgyne, the halfway/mix between man and woman, including the mix of masculinity and femininity.

To put it into perspective, I can give you some examples from when I was younger that one might say made me an ‚Äúegg‚Äù. I had to be around 4 or so. I was with my mom and we were playing together doing whatever parents do with their 4 year olds. According to my mom, as I don‚Äôt remember this happening, she told me (when I was older) that I had told her I was a girl and I was going to wear makeup. She told me I was saying it to her as a joke. Tbh, idrk. I don‚Äôt remember saying that, but if it‚Äôs true that I did, what merit does that hold?

Another time, when I was a teen (early teen years), I was at my cousins house. We were hanging out and I remember saying out loud, though idr why, but I think it had to have been in context of something we were talking about, ‚ÄúI wonder what it would be like to be a girl.‚Äù My mom was in the living room with us when I said that and she gave me a weird look and said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs weird.‚Äù At the time it was just a passing thought, I never read into it. I didn‚Äôt even know at that age being trans was even a thing. Maybe that had something to do with it?

One small part of my earlier years I also have a distinct memory of for some reason may too lay some claim. I had said to myself, ‚Äúif I were a girl, I‚Äôd definitely be either bi or a lesbian.‚Äù Once again, I never read into that at all. Another passing thought at the time which I now look back to as evidence.

I‚Äôve never felt much dysphoria. At least I don‚Äôt think I have. I‚Äôve never been particularly fond of my body. Perhaps contempt. I knew I wanted it to be different, to be better, more muscular at the very least. But that‚Äôs just because I knew guys are perceived as more attractive when they‚Äôre muscular and I never was very good at talking to girls, much less having any prospects in the dating scene in general. So I thought being more fit would up my chances. But I digress.

I‚Äôve thought about it since being more accustomed to thinking I‚Äôm NB. The idea of having a feminine/female body is somewhat enticing. I‚Äôve also liked the idea of having a vagina, but I very much enjoy my dick and wouldn‚Äôt want to get rid of it. The thought of having both sounds like a cool middle ground id be down for. Ive also really liked he thought of having boobs, and getting rid of my body hair. Even before I thought I might be NB, I thought about being the girl I was having sex with while masturbating.

I can look at a female video game character and be a bit envious that I can‚Äôt have their body and some of their clothes. But then I‚Äôll see some guys clothes and think those are pretty dope as well. Lately I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm having a pull to play girl characters in video games, and I don‚Äôt know why. I can play guy characters without a problem, but I am for some reason feeling more interested in playing as a girl.

I‚Äôve tried wearing female clothes (my gfs). Since she‚Äôs smaller than me they don‚Äôt fit well, but it felt good to wear them. Almost euphoric perhaps, but not quite. I‚Äôm not crazy about wearing makeup. I did it before when I was in drama club in high school for a play I did. It was alright for the most part, except for the mascara. I don‚Äôt like anything going near my eyes. It was a bitch to take it all off though, so not very fond of it. Again, not sure what merit this holds. Maybe I‚Äôm just grasping at straws.

The past few days I‚Äôve looked at myself in the mirror and felt contempt. The yearn for a more womanly body isn‚Äôt pervasive in my mind. Will it stay that way or not? I do not know. If you have any questions about anything specific u might want to know to help you with thinking about this, feel free to do so. I‚Äôll do my best to answer. Again, I appreciate your responses.

B. They already see a therapist due to issues with my exhusband. Is there really a difference between this person and one that ""specializes"" in trans issues?

C. I dont know how to start the conversation with them on if they want to change their name or anything.

219,2018-09-22 15:18:46,9i0fqk,4,5,"Hi,
I'm totally new to this sub, and so I'm really sorry if this is inappropriate.

I'm a 28 y.o. gay cis-male, out and pretty happy.
I have a friend, also gay, who is mid thirties and pretty miserable. He's never had a relationship and is extremely pessimistic about himself and any chance he has of one, or even hooking up.
In the past I've tried numerous interventions and pep talks, but have by now decided best I can do is be there for him. I suggested he should seek professional help a few times, but he's *very* reluctant.

Over the years he's occasionally brought up wearing make up, or putting on women's clothes, for me or for him. He's also suggested we use female pronouns. I never connected these ""dots"". Finally, he's made comments in the past that I thought were borderline trans-phobic, which would result in a big fight.

We had such a fight two weeks ago. We made up the next day, and he apologized for being insensitive. But something changed. Since then, he brought up me referring to him using female pronouns a few times. Each time I said I had no problem with it, if he wanted to. Finally, he decided we'll have a ""weekend"" in which I will refer to him as female (our language is gender heavy, unfortunately).
His reaction was incredible. He was over-joyous, he sent dozens of happy and excited emojis, he kept correcting me every time I forgot, or pointing out that I had not corrected him when he ""slipped"". He wondered aloud (via text, this is all via texting) how it would be if I referred to him using a female pronoun in a voice message. I immediately did that, and he replied with more smileys and wrote ""king"" (which is slang for me doing a great thing).

This happened last week. Since then he's backed off slightly. When I occasionally resumed referring to him as female he picked it up. But each time he ""noted"" that I did this, like he was surprised. Each time I repeated my encouragement that it was ""absolutely fine"" for me. He insists that he's a man and happily so, continuing to use the female pronoun and noting his ""pleasant surprise"" or his ""blushing"" at it... When we met face to face I dropped it in once or twice, but he didn't pick it up.

He's now calling it his ""vacation hobby"" (he's on vacation). I feel like he got scared of it all.
He's the kind of person that would be very intimidated by sudden change, and very averse to talking to anyone else about this (I'm his only gay friend). I know our other friends would be very accepting, but he won't say anything to them.

So it's just me, and I don't really know what to do. I'm pretty convinced I've now ""connected the dots"" and that this is more than a ""temporary hobby"", though I would not dare guess what exactly it is... I also feel like this connects to his (self imposed) romantic and sexual isolation...
Could I be wrong? do people have temporary feelings like this?
If not, any thoughts on how to approach this? should I encourage it? how?

236,2018-09-24 01:05:30,9idp2h,2,12,"Before 3 years ago I had no idea that I was transgender. For almost 50 years I just thought I was weird and permanently unhappy and tried to suppress those thoughts. Then I found the wiki definition of the term ‚Äúgender dysphoria‚Äù, and all the lights came on. 

For several months I processed the concept, not sure if or how to proceed. As time went by, I became more and more certain that this was what I‚Äôd been experiencing since childhood, based on googling and forums in spare moments of the day. But I come from a conservative family in a conservative state, where even being gay when I grew up would make you a target of derision. So I was afraid, and for several months couldn‚Äôt summon the courage to take action. 

As my awareness of the dysphoria and depression increased, I did thought experiments, ‚Äúwhat if...‚Äù. My resolve gradually increased, and I finally decided to go to counseling to further explore the possibility.  

I went to 6 one-hour counseling sessions with a ‚Äúgender therapist‚Äù.  This was the sort of counselor who used the ridiculous technique of staring at you until you started talking, about something, anything. 

During this time, on my own, I began exploring wearing small bits of female clothing in public. Little things like a bit of jewelry, or extra long women‚Äôs jeans. I was so happy when I got my first women‚Äôs boots. (Somewhat gender-neutral in retrospect.) So I kind of did a little of my own RLE, just because it felt good. No, it felt awesome. But never super femme, I just started moving towards a more gender-neutral style.

Finally after 6 sessions, the ‚Äúcounselor‚Äù made an offhand comment at the end of the session that she didn‚Äôt think I was a ‚Äúgood candidate‚Äù for HRT. 

That was extremely disconcerting to me. I‚Äôd already felt uncomfortable talking to her, and now she made me feel like I was on trial, trying to prove I was trans. I‚Äôm not the sort of person who likes for other people to tell me how to live, so I started googling. Eventually I came across the term ‚ÄúInformed Consent‚Äù. More light bulbs came on. 

By this time I‚Äôd sort of become invested in the knowledge that I was trans. I couldn‚Äôt let it go. I was too unhappy with how my appearance was even further masculinizing as I grew older, and saw no other path forward to a happy life. But I still wasn‚Äôt certain that I should start taking hormones - what would my parents think? My friends, my workplace, my spouse? Eventually I settled on the idea that I could hide the breast growth for a few weeks (ironic in hindsight), to give me a chance to figure out those pieces of the puzzle. I was still not certain that I should start HRT.

So I started calling around to IC clinics, and eventually made an appointment. On the evening before the appointment, I asked my spouse to confirm that she really for certain did not ever want to have kids with me.

At the clinic I go to, you must first speak with a free counselor for about an hour to make sure you fully understand the consequences and are mentally capable of consenting. Then a physician comes in and you talk for another hour or so, and at the end you walk away with a prescription. 

As I drove back to my home town, prescription in hand, my level of excitement grew, and so did my resolve. I went into the pharmacy, and got a couple of puzzled glances when they read the prescription. But they gave me the pills and I walked back to my car in a slight rain, and simultaneous sunshine, oddly enough. I felt like I was floating. Then I just sat in the car, clenching the bottle in my hand, crying and thanking God for letting me reach that day. (If that sounds sappy - too bad, your problem.) I took a double dose sitting right there in the car, shame on me :)

From that point on, I never had any thought of stopping HRT. I had a very mannish appearance, but the way I approached it was to very gradually change the way I dressed, keeping in pace with the changes the hormones precipitated in my appearance. 

I was never bold. At no point did I ever dress in a way to make me feel the slightest discomfort. The only bold leap I made was the first day I carried a purse lol. This is something that INFURIATES me about the idea of mandatory RLE - who the fuck is the arbiter of how a woman must dress!!? Utter drivel. A woman can dress any way she wants to!! A mandatory RLE requirement is ridiculous and draconian. 

As I added little bits here and there, one of my friends teased me that in day I would come to work in a skirt. I said, ‚Äúno way, I prefer sort of a butch style‚Äù.

Almost one year later to the day, I came to work in a skirt as he predicted, completely confident, not the slightest discomfort. I think I made a joking apology. He looked at me in the hall and said, ‚ÄúKelly you made the right decision‚Äù. I‚Äôll never forget that moment.

The reason I take hormones is not because of how it makes me look. It‚Äôs because of how it makes me FEEL. As an added benefit, I get to wear the clothing I‚Äôm comfortable in every day.

For almost 50 years I just thought I was weird and permanently unhappy and tried to suppress those thoughts. Then I found the wiki definition of the term ‚Äúgender dysphoria‚Äù, and all the lights came on. \n\nFor several months I processed the concept, not sure if or how to proceed. As time went by, I became more and more certain that this was what I‚Äôd been experiencing since childhood, based on googling and forums in spare moments of the day. But I come from a conservative family in a conservative state, where even being gay when I grew up would make you a target of derision. So I was afraid, and for several months couldn‚Äôt summon the courage to take action. \n\nAs my awareness of the dysphoria and depression increased, I did thought experiments, ‚Äúwhat if...‚Äù. My resolve gradually increased, and I finally decided to go to counseling to further explore the possibility.  \n\nI went to 6 one-hour counseling sessions with a ‚Äúgender therapist‚Äù.  This was the sort of counselor who used the ridiculous technique of staring at you until you started talking, about something, anything. \n\nDuring this time, on my own, I began exploring wearing small bits of female clothing in public. Little things like a bit of jewelry, or extra long women‚Äôs jeans. I was so happy when I got my first women‚Äôs boots. (Somewhat gender-neutral in retrospect.)

250,2018-09-25 05:28:23,9ipgqz,10,8,"(Sorry for the essay. I wrote a TLDR at the bottom.)

I'm so doubtful. I can't tell if how I feel is dysphoria or not because when I think of dysphoria, it's hard not to imagine intense hate for one's parts, or the inability to shower in fear of seeing them. I started questioning this a month ago, when, while talking to a trans friend, I admitted to feeling disconnected from my body, particularly in the feminine parts.

 Saying this made me remember that I used to wish I had a penis growing up (standing to pee, feeling phantom limb, etc) and that I felt... inadequate as a girl. My best friend was the paragon of femininity, (She's goth, hourglass figure, ddd or f breasts, flat stomach, long black hair, beautiful cheekbones. She behaves like a lady in serious company, and like a 13 year old boy with the crudest sense of humor imaginable when with friends.) and I was so focused on being just like her. But I wasn't just like her.

 After a while I started hating pink, dolls, girliness, anything stereotypically girl made me very upset. I would try to avoid wearing a training bra (that is until PE forced me to undress around others. I hated it, obviously. I couldn't bear for anyone to see me) until it was drilled in my head that not wearing one is inappropriate.

 I remember half-hearted attempts at things like makeup and hair care, etc. I was more interested in art and video games. 

I was obviously forced to wear dresses a lot, and I was told I looked beautiful in them, but when I'd look in the mirror I didn't see what they meant. I saw a stranger, and it scared me. As soon as puberty hit, mirrors became this new fascination for me. I'd look in them and wonder why I didn't see myself. Sometimes it would depress me, or scare me, other times I felt empty, but it was pretty hard either way.

The mirror thing changed a lot once I was allowed to cut my hair. I was happier, I thought I finally saw myself. It was a lot more feminine than I wanted, but I was over the moon. After the initial excitement wore off, I started to slip back into self-esteem issues (I was diagnosed my a child therapist as very low self-esteem and depressed) and I began a habit of flattening my breasts in the mirror.

I would have dreams of waking up with a penis, or a male body. I remember the first thing I'd do in those dreams is go and tell my best friend what happened and how happy I was about it. In hindsight, I think this is a really unusual thing for a cis ""girl"" (I really don't like calling myself that. Feels wrong now) to do.

Then, most recently, I had gotten new clothes. I was only able to get one masculine button-up, but it's quickly become my favorite shirt. Most of the others, I'm beginning to realize, show off curves, and that makes me uncomfortable. Not even 3 months ago I loved shorts and long socks, now I can't bear to imagine something so feminine. Problem is, that's most of my wardrobe, so I feel like I wish I had this intense fashion shift from feminine to masculine before I bought the clothes. I can't bear to wear half of them, because I can see my chest in them.



TLDR: Had depression and low self-esteem most my life. Grew up with neutral feelings on girliness, puberty made me hate it. I try to flatten my chest, have panic attacks when looking in the mirror naked, and wish I had a penis. I didn't start realizing this till last month, and now it's most of what I think about. I know I would be happier physically male, but don't want to look manly, though. I want to be physically androgynous (with facial hair though), but more masculine in style. Am I nonbinary or FTM? How can I tell?

296,2018-09-28 14:32:57,9jngor,7,9,"I'm a (nearly) 31-year-old man.  I'm unhappy with my body.  Not just your usual run of the mill self criticisms.  It's like... every freaking day I know more and more that this... this thing I'm in... isn't right.

I realized recently that a lot of women that I am ""attracted"" to... it isn't because of some sexual desire (admittedly, there's SOME sexual desire or other relationship-based aspect), but more than anything it's jealousy, envy.  I don't necessarily WANT them... I want to BE them.  

I've been dealing with this for awhile now.  It took some time for me to realize it myself.  Then to get the courage to talk to my therapist about it.  Then to get the courage to talk to my wife about it.  Then to get the courage to talk to a very few, select, trustworthy friends about it (unsurprisingly, all women).  Finally, the courage to come on here and talk to some strangers about it.

During this time every single person I've talked to has been so so so supportive and positive and helpful and wonderful.  But none of them have ever... experienced it.  You know?  None of them have ever gone through it.

What I honestly feel like I need more than anything is a sort of... trans-mentor.  Someone I can talk to about... everything: emotions, relationships, clothes, makeup, procedures, family, voice... all of it.  

My therapist recommended a sort of support group that's actually part of a major university's health department who are apparently like top notch folks, super progressive and helpful.  She says that once the time comes, I can use the network there to get connected with doctors or whoever to start the chemical/physical transition steps.

I'm hoping to also find a mentor-type person there that I can utilize.  But it's so scary.  It's really really really scary just taking that step.  Going and being in a room with strangers and talking about such a sensitive subject.  That terrible part of my brain keeps nagging at me ""what if they don't think you should be there?  what if they think you should just stay an ugly lump of a man forever?  what if they laugh at you?""  And I know that's crazy... but knowing that doesn't make it go away.

Another suggestion from my therapist (god I love her to death) was to have a theme party for my upcoming 31st birthday.  Have a Drag party.  So I am.  I've been preparing for awhile and just last night I tried to do my makeup by myself.  This sunday I'm going to try EVERYTHING on.  Makeup, dress, jewelry, wig, gaff, pocket bra with breast forms... everything.

So.  I don't really know why I'm making this post.  I just felt like it was an important step.  I posted a side-by-side picture last night on /r/drag... it seemed safer than coming here.  But here I am anyway.  Check out the picture [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drag/comments/9ji286/long_story_short_ive_decided_i_want_to_look/) if you want.

309,2018-09-29 08:25:58,9juynv,4,4,"Hello. Sorry to bring up the potentially sensitive topic of porn but I've been reflecting lately on how I watch exclusively gay porn, specifically twink type porn and if that relates to my gender identity and sexual identity as I identify as a(n effeminate) gay transman. I sometimes, rarely, am sexually attracted to women and occasionally look at such high quality images as the suicide girls series.   


I've been thinking about how in gay porn the guys often look better, there's a whole genre of the slender more effeminate types of guys that I like (who from my limited understanding seem to be not as sought after in the gay community?) there's always at least two guys as a given, and generally there's more of an element of equality and intimacy that is often lacking it seems in hetero porn. But being trans there is the issue as well of gender envy and not quite feeling like I fit into the gay world or community because of my plumbing. I love watching it, but I also feel a little sadly disconnected and envious when watching it. I've seen various gay men reject trans men as potential partners for this reason as well which is discouraging. Of course every person is an individual and I'm sure there are accepting individuals out there, and I can't speak for the gay community as I have no idea what it's actually like (though I'd be interested to learn more about it.)   


Anyway this post is all over the place and I apologize for that but are there other trans guys like me? Do you enjoy gay porn? If there happen to be any hetero cis individuals reading this, do you watch gay porn? Do you enjoy it? Why do you think you do if you do? (Trans)ladies this applies to you too of course.

So, I've been feeling really down lately. I'm 27, not on HRT, and struggling emotionally. The root cause won't come as any surprise; I feel unattractive and I'm afraid I never will be.

Like many I wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and see a stranger looking back. The person I see feels like a completely different person. So most of the time I just avoid mirrors.

What I can't avoid is how I feel. It has gotten pretty bad. Shaving is difficult for me, I try to take every last hair off, but if I shave two days in a row everything except my face bleeds and gets really painful ingrown hairs. 

So instead sometimes I just feel really ugly, because I can't keep myself constantly smooth shaven.

Then even when I do shave completely, dress up nicely and do my makeup as best I can, I still don't feel like it's enough. I still feel unattractive. Lately I've been trying to branch out, look for some form of validation to tell me I'm wrong, but all I've found is that people into women don't like me because I was born biologically male, and people into men don't like me because I don't identify as male.

Then there's the problem that, if I do find someone who likes me when wearing makeup, I'll never be able to see them without first spending an hour or more just getting dolled up.

I don't know what to do. I'd like your honest opinion. Am I attractive at all and should I go through HRT? I feel like I'll never be happy if I don't, but at the same time I'm afraid of therapy.

7,2018-09-03 15:15:18,9cm9cm,25,41,"Hi folks. I've been pointed here after trying other subs, and taking a look at the posts I think this is the right one, finally!

So, my [33M] whole life has always been a wreck, and it never ceases to surprise me how it can actually get worse.

Lately I've been struggling with my image and a need for self care. I hit rock bottom, but I want to look well. Alas, as man, I don't feel like anything cisgender society offers is going to work for me: Male fashion is highly related to success, and I'm nothing of that, so it doesn't really work for me.

Otoh, the rituals and things that I feel that could help me (silly things like painting my nails), which are more traditionally proper of the feminine world, I'd happily indulge myself with them, but I feel they'll end up causing me more trouble than actually be of the pragmatic help I'm in need for.

For that, I've been asking about this the last weeks, first in [queer](https://www.reddit.com/r/queer/comments/955ah0/a_fashion_meets_mental_health_kind_of_post_very/), and then in [malefashionadvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/981hab/are_there_some_styles_or_accessories_that_i_could/), with mixed responses and some good ideas. It feels like it will be a lot of work, and in my current state of complete isolation I don't think I'll be able to make it.

That's not exactly what I'm in here for anymore though. After all this thinking the last month, this thought assaulted me:

Did I ever actually felt like a man?

While plenty of times, in the past, I've given some thought into the idea that I may be a woman (and always ending up concluding it's not like that ‚ÄîI love women and everything feminine, just not for myself), I never asked myself if I am a man, or if I feel like a man.

Now, this sounds really stupid because I'm actually aware of the whole genderfluid, non-binary thing, etc. And it even sounds like something really privileged I experienced, because it means I've never felt obligated to fit as a man (it has of course affected me in unconscious ways, constricting me, but it was never a worry of me ‚Äîe.g. I would worry about looking good, but not about looking ""like a man"").

So, on the one hand, this feels like real privilege. Not having been consciously bound by gender norms, ever, is kind of part of the dream. I actually believe I'm not that strange, as plenty if not the majority of people live busy and fulfilling enough lives that they don't have to worry about these kind of things ever, but they would fit those feelings. (As in, they don't want to look like a man, or like a woman, but they just want to look good. It's very different, I believe.)

Another problem is that I don't feel like I identify with the queer community either. I'm 100% supportive of it, I think it's great, but maybe because of my character, maybe becase I never really struggled with this ‚Äînot until now, at least‚Äî, I don't think it's my fight. I'd love to feel that way, it would be great to have something to fight for, but I don't.

Looking up at Wikipedia, it feels like I'm genderless, but not in a way that is important me. I feel like ""I don't care"", instead. I don't feel the need to refer myself as neutral, or identify as one. I won't find trouble putting down I'm a male in a legal paper, because well, I have a penis and everything else about my body is male, so biologically I am one. However, if it happened to be that I woke up with a vagina instead, it'd be ok by me.

I... don't know what I'm really asking for here. DAE have been through feeling this way? Have you found joy, in indulging yourself into things? I'm very hesitant to believe that it would work for me.

Some suggested it's just mental illness affecting me, as I struggle a lot with finding joy in things. As in, if I had a plan, this wouldn't be a worry. In the end, if I'm resorting to my body and appearance for the first time in my life, is because it's all I have left. I now understand, more than ever, people with disorders regarding their image.

One thought I'm also struggling to consolidate, is that it feels like I want to indulge myself in femininity more because I've never had (and everything hints that I'll never have) access to it, due to me never having had a proper SO in my lifetime. I love aesthetics, clothing, lingerie, but I don't love it for myself, or just for sexual excitement reasons, but more because they're nice.

12,2018-09-05 03:20:59,9d2kuf,9,23,"I'm born female, and a college student. I didn't even know there were other options til I got here a few years ago, and even then I was in denial of their existence because of internalized homophobia and transphobia. I worked past it all and grew up. I discovered that I'm very likely biromantic asexual, or somewhere in that area. I feel attracted to multiple genders, and don't really feel sexual attraction, not that I would really know what that feels like. Part of me is really worried that all of my questioning is solely due to learning all of these new things in a short amount of time. 

It especially worries me that I've been questioning gender the past few months. It's not something I'm really too worried about, but sometimes I feel whatever it is really intensely. I have a couple friends I could maybe talk to who would know what it feels like to not be cisgender, but I feel like it's not something I should ask about. Pretty much everyone automatically assumes I'm a ciswoman and straight 100%. I guess I just give of a vibe or something? But it makes things difficult when it comes to questioning and dating.

Since I'm in a sub dealing with gender, I'm just wondering if anyone else gets the same feeling? If there's a name for it? Anything?

The best I can describe it is that I very rarely feel female. I acknowledge that I biologically am female, and I don't really mind certain aspects of it. If anything I could do without the period and breasts. The gender norms have always bothered me. Growing up I wished I was a boy. At the time, my parents gave in a bit more and let me wear more andro/masc clothes. It wasn't til I got my first period that I was expected to be female. I didn't even start trying to act female til then either. Since I stared wondering and questioning, it feels more like an in-between in a way. I still sometimes feel feminine. Sometimes I feel more masculine. There are many days I wish I were male, that I'd be happier. But I also don't feel like I'm dedicated enough to go through a transition. 

I guess the majority of days I feel content enough to stay the way I am, just a few changes I'd prefer but may not need necessarily. I've always dressed androgynously, though it's gotten more difficult because my body type is very difficult to pass as anything other than female. 

I've thought about name changes as well, just because my name is overly feminine. There are other names I like better that are more andro/masc. My friends would very likely respect it, since a few of them have done similar. I just don't want people asking questions when I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

If you're familiar with a comic that's been floating around where an afab person dresses more andro and wants to pass as male, it's in shades of purple I think, says something about being okay with their current self while also feeling like they'd be happier elsewhere. That's close to what I'm feeling.

tl;dr I have feelings I don't have names for. I feel more andro than anything else. I want to change more subtlety because I hate attention.

I didn't even know there were other options til I got here a few years ago, and even then I was in denial of their existence because of internalized homophobia and transphobia. I worked past it all and grew up. I discovered that I'm very likely biromantic asexual, or somewhere in that area. I feel attracted to multiple genders, and don't really feel sexual attraction, not that I would really know what that feels like. Part of me is really worried that all of my questioning is solely due to learning all of these new things in a short amount of time. \n\nIt especially worries me that I've been questioning gender the past few months. It's not something I'm really too worried about, but sometimes I feel whatever it is really intensely. I have a couple friends I could maybe talk to who would know what it feels like to not be cisgender, but I feel like it's not something I should ask about. Pretty much everyone automatically assumes I'm a ciswoman and straight 100%. I guess I just give of a vibe or something? But it makes things difficult when it comes to questioning and dating.\n\nSince I'm in a sub dealing with gender, I'm just wondering if anyone else gets the same feeling? If there's a name for it? Anything?\n\nThe best I can describe it is that I very rarely feel female. I acknowledge that I biologically am female, and I don't really mind certain aspects of it. If anything I could do without the period and breasts. The gender norms have always bothered me. Growing up I wished I was a boy. At the time, my parents gave in a bit more and let me wear more andro/masc clothes. It wasn't til I got my first period that I was expected to be female. I didn't even start trying to act female til then either. Since I stared wondering and questioning, it feels more like an in-between in a way. I still sometimes feel feminine. Sometimes I feel more masculine. There are many days I wish I were male, that I'd be happier. But I also don't feel like I'm dedicated enough to go through a transition. \n\nI guess the majority of days I feel content enough to stay the way I am, just a few changes I'd prefer but may not need necessarily. I've always dressed androgynously, though it's gotten more difficult because my body type is very difficult to pass as anything other than female. \n\nI've thought about name changes as well, just because my name is overly feminine.

I explained my pronouns to every every single class.

My approach was keep it short and sweet and not go into details. I explained that I preferred they/them pronouns, I gave them examples: 

""They are my science teacher, they're always wearing a bow tie, I'm so annoyed they gave us a quiz on Monday...by the way, you have a quiz on Monday."" 

I asked them to respect that my pronouns are what I would like to go by, and asked if they had any questions. The questions they asked were really thoughtful (for context I mostly teach 7th and 8th grade with one Chemistry class). They asked things such as: ""Would you like us to still call you Mr.?"" ""What should we do if we mess your pronouns?"" One student didn't even care about the pronouns and only asked what was on Monday's quiz. It made me really proud of the students I'm teaching, and hopeful for the next generation.

P.S. I wanted to thank everyone who gave me encouraging comments today, it was very sweet and exactly the sort of support I needed!

I'm 21 years old, afab, and just... confused. It's hard to figure out where to start, but in essence I've been having these confusing, distressing feelings about my identity, gender, and body pop up every few months for a couple years. The big thing is that I really don't identify with my body. There's this disconnect when I look in the mirror, I suppose - a lack of ""oh, that's me."" On top of that, I have some dysphoria (not sure if that's exactly the right term) around my breasts to the point that I can't lay around without a shirt/top and no strong connection to ""woman"" as an identity. I can say with some certainty that I'm not transmasculine, but beyond that I'm not sure.

36,2018-09-09 11:12:12,9ec89e,6,31,"Hi guys. Just a question / thinking out loud rant thing. How comfortable do you feel wearing clothes in public that are a bit ‚Äúout there‚Äù?

My personal journey has been pretty smooth tbh. I identified as a gay male for years (so I haven‚Äôt worn anything ‚Äústraight‚Äù in a really long time) until fairly recently when I started wearing skirts, tights, lipstick, etc. My own hair is quite short and let‚Äôs say Frank Ocean-inspired. But I often wear long colourful wigs. Not all the time, but maybe 2-3 days of a week. My friends would see me wearing jeans and a tshirt one day to a dress another. Just for the record the femme clothes are not just a fashion statement but rather a signal of me feeling particularly feminine that day. Genderqueer/fluid is the closest label I can relate to. 

I live in a very liberal area of a liberal city. So far I had exactly zero problems with wearing whatever I want, even to work (I work in a casual attire environment with no real dress code). 

So it sounds like I can‚Äôt really complain, but when I am out by myself wearing something femme I always feel a little bit nervous. If I walk into a cafe and someone laughs loudly my first nervous thought is that it‚Äôs because my wig is slipping and I rush to the bathroom to double check. If the waiter is not particularly friendly (in my city it is very common for people to just start a friendly chat about the weather/the weekend/whatever) I fear it‚Äôs because they clock me and they don‚Äôt like what they see. 

The nervous feeling is still there even though I only ever hear positive comments, if anything, from strangers. Well surely not everyone is into my style, but at least nobody shouts the F worr at me - which I have experienced plenty in the city I was born in before I moved. 
Just the other day an old lady in the park joked she‚Äôs jealous of my legs, and a waitress said my outfit is on point. Basically there is nothing but positive reinforcement, but still I feel nervous. 

I feel safer if I‚Äôm ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù when out so I‚Äôm constantly smoking, looking at my phone (writing a reddit post...), or just rummaging in my bag for no real reason, so I have ‚Äúsomething to do‚Äù when walking to look busy instead of having to look straight ahead. For whatever reason escaping in the little world of rummaging in my bag feels safer, but it‚Äôs pretty silly, and really I‚Äôm in constant danger of walking into a lampost. 

Do others have this feeling? Does it go away eventually? I imagine it does, first time I painted my nails I assumed the whole street is going to stare, and here we are two years later I don‚Äôt ever ever even think about my nails. Skirts and dresses are still relatively new thing for me and usually I wear those with out friends or just around the house.

42,2018-09-10 22:09:23,9ermkn,1,7,"I guess I should start off with a little background. I'm afab and have been medically transitioning for three years ago. When I initially started questioning five years ago I was coming from a more black and white thinking because that was all I was exposed to trans wise. I only had seen very few nonbinary people and had all these misconceptions of what one had to be in order to be binary trans (I even thought you had to be a certain sexuality). I had established myself as agender back then and felt guilty for even considering buying myself a binder back then (I really had no clue how diverse everyone's experience was then, I bought too much into the whole 'trans enough' nonsense). But when I realized that what I thought you needed to be and experience to be binary trans was false I started identifying as binary. I use to feel a lot more strongly about wanting to be seen as male and using he/him pronouns when hardly anyone ever saw me as anything but female. 

But after several months of medically transition I started to get he/him and even three years on sometimes I do feel weird about it and I don't know why. It doesn't make me feel uncomfortable, just weird. I grew my hair out because I kind of miss long hair and it was at this point in time I started getting shes and hers. I became frustrated and had my hair cut short (unfortunately shorter than I wanted) but...I kind of disliked how masc it made me look even though my girlfriend at the time (not knowing that I didn't like how masc it made me look) liked how masc it made me look. I kind of like it when I grow it out longer just like I kind of like it when I dress more androgynous rather than just plain masculine. 

But it's always kind of left me feeling complicated because I think why only after transition did I start feeling this way. I hate that I always have a nagging doubt at the back of my head questioning my transness despite having started my medical transition three years ago and have no real strong desire to be associated with womanhood or looking anything like I did pre medical transition. It doesn't help that I try to find other men who are more feminine but many times I discover they were just closeted about being trans. I have to remind myself that femininity is different for everyone, someone are just feminine even while some like to use femininity to express their feminine gender. But even then sometimes I don't feel welcome in spaces like that because I'm not amab even though I may have the same struggles they do now in terms of finding fit and appearing gnc.  

I still don't know what I want people to refer me as. I don't know why being referred to in male terms sometimes feel weird yet sometimes I feel indifferent and I just feel mostly embarrassed when people refer to me in female terms. Sometimes I just feel like a different breed of dude if that made any sense. I like the way I look though I hate the fact that when people read someone as male if they look little too androgynous they get read as a teen. But I can't really control what strangers read me as and never tried out any other pronouns because I feel I'd be too much of a hassle. I've never corrected anyone in my life. I don't even know if I feel more binary or nonbinary, and a lot of the time I kind of feel like neither really fit 100% even though I don't know if that really makes any sense when they are opposites.

when i feel feminine, i feel very free, like a leaf on wind, like im unencumbered yet mysterious. i feel connected to the earth, to my mother and grandmother and ancestors, to other women. i feel protective and nurturing, seductive, delicate.

Because I am not advancing much on my own, I figured I'd start 'softening the terrain' in acquaintances and friends, so that they can know what's up if I start showing up with certain looks, and so any fuss can happen now and be avoided once and for all with them. That'd be the dream.

*Or* maybe I'm forcing myself to advance through announcing things that haven't happened yet. I don't really know tbh. I'm very much of a mess.

It was very hard to bring up the topic, and while this specific pair of friends aren't the most emotinally available or culturised persons, they were very comprensive and accepting. I am lucky in that my little environment cares about me, and are not intolerant people at all. That, I knew, so in that sense I was just giving them sorts of a *teaser trailer* of what could probably happen.

Eventually, through trying to explain this ‚Äîit's so complicated to! :C‚Äî, I broke down crying. The last straw was talking about my fear of going this way, and not feeling ok in it either. I'm trying to get a hold of anything, and so this feels sorts of a last resource. I guess that those tears were more about my overall feelings as a person, than about any gender thing. Gender feels as a medium for certain feelings that I was never able to exploit or give a place to in my life.

Today I feel like a fraud for having asked of their attention.

T is going great! I feel amazing and myself, so that's nice. I'm starting to plan for the future and see what I want to or need to change as I start to look and sound different. 

I have a really cool feminine given name. I love the story behind it, how it sounds- it just feels so *me,* you know? However, in some spaces where I don't have time to really explain The Genders, I also go by my last name in situations where people don't need my full name, which is conveniently a common enough first name of many guys. I would not mind going by this name.

Between you all and I, I would probably be okay using my given name even when I look like a guy. I like to think that my name has no gender, it's *my* name and it's whatever *I* want it to be. However, I'm bracing myself for people misgendering me if they see my name before they see my face. (to explain, I'm nonbinary they/them, but I'm much better being read as male than female) 

Is it worth it to legally change my name so that my current last name goes where my first name is? I would change my last name to my grandmother's maiden name - the combination of the two is really smooth sounding.

I honestly just can't deal with this bullshit like im already fucking mentally ill, I'm fucking gay and of course now I might be trans. I really just want to fucking ignore it, just throw it away and leave it but the more I think about it the more signs that show and I don't know if I'm more terrified of not being trans after coming out or actually being fucking trans. I don‚Äôt want this shit okay. I just want to be your average cishet female. Or even better, cishet male. Why couldn't I have just been born fucking male? Why did I have to be a fucking girl?

I have a workmate that when it was her turn to introduce herself at a staff meeting and her pronouns, she said she didn't have any. We had a conversation outside the meeting and I asked her to clarify because I was confused about what she meant and so were others.

She didn't say that she was agender, genderfluid, gender queer or anything at all.

84,2018-09-20 01:50:14,9hb7mk,18,50,"Even as a kid I hated the idea that I had to be a certain way because I was a boy. I hated the idea the some things were only for girls; it made me feel isolated and locked out.

I've always felt like I related more to girls, been closer to them. I always said if I had three wishes, one of them would be to be able to shapeshift so I could become a woman whenever I wanted.

At the same time though I don't feel a great deal of dysphoria about being male. It's irksome feeling pressure to conform to male stereotypes, and I often feel like, ""Ugh, I have to be a guy."" But I don't like, look at myself in the mirror and wonder why I have to look this way.

I've done a little crossdressing and have been exploring more feminine expressions. Instead of the ""Ugh, I have to,"" feeling it's more like ""Yay, I get too."" Nothing strong enough to want to transition, mind you, though I have thought about it. I just don't feel uncomfortable enough in my male body to want to change it.

I'd much rather just, you know, wear lip gloss and nail polish sometimes because it makes me happy, not be restricted to what my biological sex ""determines"" I look and feel like.

I'm a very physically large person (195cm and haven't been under 110kg in my adult life) and feel that I present very masculine with little that I can do about that. My face is all prominent nose, heavy brow ridge and strong jaw while any exercise I do gives me massive shoulders... etc...

&amp;#x200B;

I've been working on figuring this out for a while with very little success. In the past I have struggled to buy clothes due to poverty and just relying on buying cheap tees and pants from big budget brand stores where I can at least find things in my size. Most of my clothes are over 5 years old at a minimum...

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm living currently there was a Pride rally today and I just couldn't face going because of an intense feeling of ""where do I stand?"" I didn't have anything that I felt that I could wear that would denote me as anything other than cishet male (I've put on some weight recently and clothes that I used to wear sometimes currently don't fit) and couldn't face the possibility of feeling completely invisible at such an event... or even being lumped together as what I've been struggling to move away from.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know how to approach this at all because I don't have any answers. I don't know simple ways in which I can casually feminize my appearance. I'm trying to lose weight because currently I have a 44"" waist and can't find anything to wear that would make me feel ""attractive"". The photo attached was taken today as I left work because I couldn't take being seen by anyone like that any longer. The shirt in this photo was something I was given 7 years ago as part of a Secret Santa where I was working and I still wear it because it's still in one piece... x\_x

So ive been confused about gender or a long while and kind of just been ignoring it. The issue for me is like i dont think i fit fully withing male or female. I do alot of gener non conforming things like crossdressing. Overall i really dont agree with gendering of things like items, jobs, roles, activities basically anything that isnt alive. 

That leads me to things. Because of that i dont really know where i fit bc i dont really get the societal definition of male. I also dont want to conform to what is expected of being a male bc i want to do everything male female or otherwise. Im just not sure. Like being a guy is fun but at the same time i dont really feel like that it. TBH it totally could be that im just a little out there and just a bit of a gender non conforming male.

Another one is Devi which is part of Durga Devi which is an Indian god that is very relatable to me. I'm not indian and I don't practice hinduism, I just think that it's neat. Just mentioning this because I'm sure that someone will probably think that based off of my choices.\n\nCan you guys provide name suggestions and maybe how you picked a name if you changed yours.

i thought i dressed pretty neutrally for my interview today and i wasn‚Äôt even binding but the guy still called me sir and he. last time this happened i just rolled with it but i hated trying to pass every day and i think also i got soft fired for being Gender Confusing. i would prefer to be out as using they pronouns but that‚Äôs not feasible in every work environment and failing that i would at least like to pass as female i guess just for the sake of not having to wear a binder every day. but if they hear me on the phone and then i show up in a skirt or whatever i‚Äôm worried about being subjected to misdirected transmisogyny and not getting hired @____@

Maybe you have answered questions like this before, but I still would like to here from you:

&amp;#x200B;

I don't like labels, but the fact is, I am a male that is attracted to both females and males. Got it?

My female partner of 5 years is very non-judgmental and open minded, knows that I have quite a strong feminine aspect and that am a bit of a sub in the bedroom:)

However she is very much committed to monogamy, monogamy and only monogamy. 

I love her and I love our relationship and I don't want to change it or lose her.   
However I feel as though I have a raging inner non-binary, fluid and florid sexuality. I would love to put on a costume and Drag it out like some freaky alien sex pot from Elvendale. I mean all of that in a thoroughly positive light, so don't take  offence anyone!

99.9% of people automatically see me as a cisgender woman and straight. I came out last year as biromantic ace. Though part of me wonders if being ace stems from internalized phobias. 

I'm getting ready to graduate from college. And as much as I love my major in psychology, the field itself is notorious for being hesitant to admit to grad school or hire people who don't follow societal norms or have/have had mental illness. So seeing as it's my last year here, and I'll be interviewing for programs and jobs, it may not be in my best interest to start experimenting now. On the other hand though, college is one of the best places to explore and discover yourself.

Part of me even feels like I'm not allowed to explore anything. That I should just accept me for me. But then that feeling comes back, and I know something isn't right.

The feeling I get comes in waves and varies in intensity. I don't mind being female in some ways, but I don't exactly love it either. I never understood the whole concept of feeling and accepting your womanhood. I also don't feel like a man either. Which is kinda strange to me because I've always thought I'd be happier if I were a man. It's like, I sometimes feel like a man, but not a whole man. I'm okay with me, I just sometimes wish I was different. 

It seems to change all the time though. I'm often just okay with me, me as in me, not my body, just wanting to get healthy overall (myself and body) again. I hate my body in most of it's aspects. And I unfortunately started an unhealthy drinking habit as a way of punishing myself. It also doesn't help that the drinks make my mind looser, and I feel more like myself.

Growing up, I was a very different person. A spoiled brat who held their parents' beliefs (religious and conservative) to a T. Once I got to college and moved out, I started changing and just grew up. I'm very different from who I used to be. 

This brings me to the name thing. I'm not the old Emma. I don't even feel like I am Emma anymore. People say that name in reference to me and my first thought is ""who's that?"". My family has made nicknames for me for years, most of them mocking names, and all formed from my given name. They don't care that it's insulting and hurtful to have your own name hurled out in another form, an insulting version of the name. It doesn't feel like Emma is my name anymore. I don't feel like Emma anymore.

I feel like a name change is in order. I may not be ready to explore in other ways, but I think I am ready when it comes to making a new me. A name. And new style. To make myself feel more confident that I can be me, that I'm not tied down to my family and hometown. Maybe then I'll start to feel safer in exploring gender. 

I don't want friends to start asking why I'm changing, but at the same time I want them to know part of it. I'm not ready to talk about pronouns or gender. But the things with my family I think I can tell, and it'll cover the name change.

My name is Ezra Morris and I am a graduate student from the psychology department at Towson University. I am writing to invite you to participate in a research study about the subtle positive and negative messages received during therapy/counseling as experienced by those with a gender identity that differs from which they were assigned at birth.

If you decide to participate in this study, you will be asked to recount both subtle positive and negative experiences that you have had in therapy/counseling because of your gender identity. Contact information for emotional support services will be provided at the end of the survey, should you need them.

In order to participate, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a gender identity that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth. In addition, you must have attended therapy/counseling within the last 5 years while identifying as a gender (or lack thereof) that does not match that of which you were assigned at birth, or while exploring your gender identity. Your gender identity does NOT have to be the reason for/focus of your attendance.

Participation is completely voluntary and should take about 10 minutes to complete. If you have any questions about the study, please contact me at [kmorri27@students.towson.edu](mailto:kmorri27@students.towson.edu), message me here, or leave a comment.

However, secretly always conflicted about gender identity, particularly since until the last few years didn't even know there was a terminology for what I felt. From a young age, been fascinated with female body and female clothing - initially thought it was some kind of fetish or just the stirrings of horny young maleness. But as time passed I realized it was just as much admiration, if not occasional envy that women could wear beautiful things and be graceful swishing about, while I was locked into the relatively narrow image and design choices of manhood. 

I live in a country where sexual and gender identity has for the longest time been influenced by religion and outdated traditional viewpoints. Gay men and transgender men, for instance, are generally lumped together as ""boys who want to be girls"", with matching derogatory terminology. Lesbians versus transgender women likewise. So it was confusing growing up; I knew I wasn't gay although I've been able to appreciate the handsomeness of other men, and my attraction has pretty much always run towards women. But sometimes that attraction, wanting to be with a woman, would spill over to wanting to BE that woman, to have her long hair and smooth skin and soft curves, to wear a colorful dress and cute shoes... ah well. 

Went out once with a woman who was open-minded about it and possibly genderqueer; she got me to put on one of her dresses (I was smaller than her) and I was surprised by how comfortable I felt in it, how right it seemed with a lovely large-rimmed hat on. Have had few such opportunities since to express that hidden part of myself.

Happy enough to be male most of the time; obvious advantages given the patriarchal society in which I live. Still, there are days when I wish I could be that someone else, even for a few hours, not even being with anyone - glad to be with my wife - just enjoying being that girl. 

I've sort of told one person, an old college friend, who is dear enough to accept everything about me as I do about her. Nobody else, not my wife, nor my family, nor anybody else I consider close, knows. Possibly my deepest, not-too-darkest secret.

I also *really* want to cut my hair, but it‚Äôd look terrible (I have weird unpredictable 3b hair)- but I also want to have long girly hair somedays. I have days where I just want my chest to be flat, and I‚Äôm happy when I can‚Äôt see it, but I also have some days where I want to have boobs and hips and dress feminine. I‚Äôve also been thinking about my sexuality a lot, whether I like girls or boys. I like both, I think, but in different ways- and sometimes I can‚Äôt tell if I want to be with them, or I want to be them. I recently joined my school‚Äôs GSA, which should be good for learning more and stuff, I‚Äôm just not actually comfortable with talking about this in front of my friends or teachers. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. ', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Am I genderfluid? Or something else? (16 AFAB)', 'created': 1537142411.0}"

But those who dismiss him almost never know a single thing about his sexual difference theory. Like that fact it is based on a complete reworking of Aristotelian logic, which he supplements with thinkers like Frege and Peirce and things like Russel's paradox.

And yes, dear reader, there are differences between the sexes. Of which he claims there are only two. Yet his theory is not a binary opposition. How can this be, you ask?

Well, to find out we have to turn to his infamous formulas of sexuation. They are notoriously difficult, as you may have heard. But it is more important to understand them today than ever before, what with the sudden proliferation of genders -- a phenomenon which is not subversive in the least. The power structures in our society are not touched in the slightest when men wear dresses and women grow beards. In fact, they are strengthened ten-fold. More market points to exploit. Marx was right, capital needs to expand and it needs an ideological structure to support that expansion. Which is why big corporations are the staunchest defenders of gender theory as a rule. The truly great French theorists (Lacan, Badiou...) can help us bury pro-capitalist ideologues like Foucault and Butler once and for all. But I digress...

Here's a free PDF of a book that's making the rounds because it goes into depth into these formulas. Looks like the author has OK'd the PDF release of it, just asks the word be spread if you download, which is why I'm posting on this forum today.

55,2018-09-18 19:19:53,9gxuvh,12,6,"Hey, so I kinda feel bad about posting this since I feel like there are so many already out there, but I figured at worst case it will only get buried and I'll still be in the same spot anyway.

So I am AFAB, 19 years old. I've identified as genderfluid since I was 15, when I learned the term, but ever since I've been plagued by the thought I can't come out since ""its only a phase, and I'll grow out of it."" Because of this I've never told anyone that I felt male, and my Mom has been fairly adamant on buying me girly clothes, luckily she's stopped this once I left the house, but she's made her point on how much she wants me to act like a girl. And my Dad isn't super understanding either.

The problem is that in the past I have not  felt a strong inclination towards one gender or the other, except occasionally when I feel that the she/her or my feminine birth name is just wrong and it causes me a bit of unease. Recently this all changed. I got fed up of hiding who I am, someone called my by my birth name and I felt incredibly dysphoric when they used the she/her pronouns. So I came out as genderfluid to one of my best friends and my little brother (both very accepting), but these doubts continue to plague me. Since I don't always feel disgust at my body, and this happens occasionally and I usually just feel gender neutral. But ever since I came out I have felt far more masculine than in the past and I haven't felt feminine at all.

Some more information:

I feel euphoria with: 

* wearing male clothes
* appearing masculine
* seeing my chest flat (I literally started laughing and crying at the same time when I got a binder)
* passing
* the idea of making myself more masculine: tattoos, piercings, etc...

I feel dysphoric with:

* my hair length (it is too long, I'm getting it cut tomorrow)
* my boobs (I hate hugging people and can rarely bring myself to do it)
* my lips and facial structure (very feminine)
* people using she/her pronouns when I feel masculine
* my voice (too high)

When I say I feel gender neutral, its more of a numb ""I don't care at all"" feeling. I don't know if this is actually what it feels like to be gender neutral or if I have just suppressed myself so long.

I do not experience dysphoria with my genitals or my period, but I'm not sure if this is something that I might feel discomfort with later once I am more comfortable identifying as male since this seems more recent. I am terrified of really coming out if it is a phase, but I do feel really strongly about it right now.

I like the idea of testosterone, but I don't like the idea of having body or facial hair (everything else male is fine) and I think that stuff isn't cut and dry. If I had the choice I probably would have been born male. But I also don't want to do through a surgery, that sounds terrifying to me. I feel guilty for wanting to be male when there are people who are struggling with this a lot more than I am. 

In the past I have always felt gender neutral, only occasionally male. I did try to change my name to be gender neutral in elementary school and got ridiculed for it. I was able to wear what I wanted (male-style clothes without being straight masculine) without anyone questioning me, since I just looked like a tom-boy. So these feelings are catching me off guard. It doesn't help that I can't pin down my sexual identity either. 

But in the past I have been interested in dresses or makeup (not so much anymore), but I can't tell if that was more of my desire or that I just wanted to be accepted by those around me.

Anyway, I guess my question comes down to this: Am I genderfluid? Trans? Non-binary? Just like cross-dressing? What it is like to be gender neutral? Is this all a phase? Is it weird if I never felt this way as a child? And what can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

For the past year or so I've been questioning gender things. But I always keep jumping back and forth between thinking I might not be female, not entirely at least, and that I could never be anything else. 

Sometimes I feel like the ""I could never be"" means that I could never allow myself or that I could never pass if I was. I'm still a product of how I was raised, so I still have a lot of internalized phobias. But also knowing that even if I knew for sure, that it would be even worse for my family to find out than if they found out I'm bi/ace. And also knowing that my body would never pass.

I don't know anything for sure. Just that I feel like 'something' maybe 90% of time, neither or both female/male. Maybe 8% I get a strong feeling that I'm male, but it lasts maybe a few hours at a time. And the remaining 2% is female. There are some days I wish I were male, that I'd be happier that way. I even picked out names. On rare occasion, I feel very feminine. I don't like presenting feminine. 

I guess I just wish I'd been born male, that I'd be happier then. But I fear regret so much. I'm anxious and fearful of everything. It's like I want to be male, but I also don't want to have to go through so much to there. But also knowing that I might be stuck in the same place I am tonight, wishing I'd taken advantage of the acceptance in a college setting that isn't always given post-grad.

I think most of the time I feel okay how I am, it's just those random moments where I just feel wrong. So I'm led to the thought that maybe I'm just not on the binary. Maybe I'm meant to be more masculine than I am, just not entirely male. I'm pretty sure I'm not entirely female.
