2,2018-02-01 07:12:24,7uh1l8,4,10,"Hi! 

So I am 19 years old and amab and I have been dating my girlfriend for almost 2 years. For a little while now I have been thinking about my gender identity and realized I may be non binary. I have been holding this in and over FaceTime tonight I accidentally told her. She was pretty confused and shaken by it. Over the course of the night she fluctuated between saying that it will take time but she loves me and wants me to be comfortable, to begging me to just be a guy. 

To complicate this I don’t really have the vocabulary to describe how I feel yet so this only makes her confusion worse. I’m worried that as I go through this process of figuring myself out this will hang over our relationship and she will look at me differently. 

I was wondering if there was any advice people had to make this go as smoothly as possible and to help her understand, I am willing to give her that time to understand and ideally ending the relationship is not what I want. I’m more focused on helping her come to terms with it than leaving her immediately, although if she can never accept it that may have to happen.

I'm bi-gender - not androgyne - I am male OR female, depending on the day and context, and that in-between place drives me nuts. And my body is entirely mixed up/androgynous.

I'm AFAB, 5'9"", naturally no hips (too narrow to give birth, I had my kids by caesarian), square waist, large breasts, long but very well muscled legs, a wide, well-muscled back, and my face is, er, handsome rather than pretty (gamine is a term that was used recently) and I have a mild widow's peak hairline that becomes more pronounced when I'm on T. Even my fat distribution is masculine - when I was fat all my fat went to my belly - I still had NO hips. If I work out/become fit, I bulk up like a guy, even without taking T. When I was a four-sport athlete as a teen (swim, cheer, X country, track, and I tried football but my mom wouldn't sign the football waiver, so I put myself in the football PE class), my thighs were separately thicker than my waist.

I generally come off as a very masculine female, with the exception of my boobs, which is enhanced by my frequently male behavior and unconscious body language.

50,2018-02-06 22:38:08,7vrba2,3,5,"I'm super nervous, but I decided I'm finally going to allow myself to explore this. I'm not sure if I experience dysphoria or not. Here's a list of reasons I'm questioning. If anyone can relate or if I sound a certain way please let me know, I know my own subconscious tends to push back on my questioning and brush it aside so I don't know if I'm just blind to the obvious or if it's as ambiguous as I think. So here's a few things just off the top of my head.

* I have always hated my name, it's too girly for me
* Usually when I wear makeup I feel awkward, I honestly FEEL like I look like a man wearing makeup even though I know I don't. Same thing goes for wearing dresses and other ""girly"" clothes.
* I'm pretty short and thin but view myself as larger than I am. It catches me off guard when people make references to my size. Possibly because I work out a lot and even though I'm still small, only I can see the progress I've made compared to how I used to look.
* I work in a male-dominated field and sometimes when I speak at work my voice catches me off guard because I expect it to be deeper. Not sure if this is dysphoria or just me wanting to fit in, but it feels significantly weird emotionally
* I have downloaded apps trying to see how I would look with a buzz cut and facial hair... they all sucked for what it's worth
* Previously when I've let myself think about possibly being trans or GNC I've found myself thinking that if only I was taller it would be much easier to make a decision, I guess I'm hesitant about being such a little dude
* A while ago I was at a festival trying to find a bathroom, ended up in some restaurant using the men's room because whoever was in the women's was taking too long. The door didn't have a lock but I had to pee too bad to care. A guy ended up opening the door without knocking and retreated upon seeing me but I could hear him yell ""THERE'S A GIRL IN THERE""... it's really hard to explain but this freaked me out. Kinda feels like I forget I'm a girl and when others see me as one I am confused or just feel weird and somewhat bummed about it.
* My self-esteem regarding my attractiveness is strong enough to where I occasionally wonder if I'm actually narcissistic lol, but if someone calls me pretty I feel like I don't trust it... I have been called handsome a couple of times and though I was confused about why they chose that word, I felt pretty fly
* (nsfw) At least 9 out of 10 times when I jerk off I'm imagining myself with a penis.
* When I was younger I played a couple MMO's and on each one had two accounts, one was a female character and one was male 
* As a kid I remember praying that I would wake up the next day as a boy.
* Related to how I hate my name: I also remember thinking that I would be happy as a boy even with any name, even ones I didn't like, like ""Guy"" (lol?).
* Also, I remember feeling disappointed as a kid because in my opinion, men couldn't be ugly but women had to work hard to be pretty. For what it's worth, I'm bisexual and also no longer hold this opinion, lol. But my response to it back then was that I was so jealous that I'd prefer being a man to working hard to be pretty.
* Lastly, being bisexual I do date men and women and somehow I feel more gay when I'm with a man.

I realize that I'm probably not cis at least but something in me is so opposed to exploring beyond that, so this is me trying to get over that. I don't know how, or if I would ever want to, tell anyone else about being anything other than cis. I have long hair and aside from not wearing much makeup and avoiding blatantly feminine clothes I don't think anyone would ever think that I'm questioning this unless I've opened up to them about little things here and there and they thought too much about it. I'm not sure why but I'm nervous to talk to anyone in real life about it. I already posted this in the ""questioning"" subreddit but I wanted to put it here too in case anyone nonbinary can relate or if people think I just sound trans or what. If it's not cool to post in multiple subs please let me know, I don't use reddit aside from lurking on other subs until now so I apologize if that's considered spamming.

I wear an underworks binder daily, but it is very uncomfortable to wear during my workout. I’m pretty large chested, I’m a DD so I’m not totally flat in a binder but I feel much more confident and comfortable when I wear one. I’m super self conscious about boob bounce!

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

Hey all! First time posting on this site. Please pardon any missteps.


&amp;nbsp;


I'm looking for help finding a word for my gender.


&amp;nbsp;


Going through questioning gave me a much better understanding of my gender, but I'm still left looking for a way to get that understanding across without writing out paragraphs. XD I'd like to find a word for my gender identity that's more specific than 'nonbinary' alone (which is what I currently use) but not too obscure, and I'm running into trouble.


&amp;nbsp;


There may not be a non-obscure word, and that's okay! Nonbinary is better than nothing, and I don't want to end up with a term I'll just have to end up re-explaining anyway.


&amp;nbsp;


If I try to describe my gender, could anyone tell me if they know any terms off the top of their head that might fit? (Not looking for anyone to do research on my behalf!)


&amp;nbsp;


My gender is:

- a ""positive"" sense of gender (not as in ""good,"" more as in ""testing positive""; I'm not agender, and terms like ""void"" don't describe my sense of gender)

- a single, discrete gender (not bigender/multigender, not experienced as a mix of genders)

- static (neither fluid nor flux)

- neither binary male nor binary female (and not significantly aligned with either)

- unrelated to gender roles/expression/etc


&amp;nbsp;


I have physical dysphoria along transmasc lines (I'm AFAB), but I don't think I could be considered transmasculine because I don't feel like my gender is close enough to male. While I know that if I complete the transition steps I want, I might be read as male, that's more a side effect of the steps instead of a goal. (I'd rather be read as *neither* binary gender, but no one would automatically think ""neither"" rather than ""idk which,"" so I might as well try to relieve my physical dysphoria and take whatever comes.)


&amp;nbsp;


I also don't see my gender as ""neutral,"" particularly because whenever I see that word come up, it seems to overlap with being agender or otherwise lacking in gendered feeling. That's the opposite of my experience. I don't have ""nothing"" just because it's ""neither"".


&amp;nbsp;


If I had to put my gender on a line between ""man"" and ""woman,"" then I'd say it'd be in the middle, but I don't perceive it as half-and-half or anything like that. It exists in relation to binary genders but remains its own, discrete thing. My experience of gender is not a duality or a mix. Sort of like how, even though I developed from a combination of my parents' genes, my sense of self arising from that physical combination is not ""half-Mom, half-Dad."" I'm related to them, but a separate individual. Or like baking a cake: can't make it without the ingredients, but a piece of cake is not the same as having eggs and flour and such, and you wouldn't be able to get eggs back out of a baked cake.


&amp;nbsp;

74,2018-02-09 14:31:08,7wds76,14,13,"Dear stars in the sky, does this make me fucking embarrassed.

I'm nonbinary?

I'm posting this because I'm starting to dwell to much of it and thought that maybe voicing it for a change would help with that.

I'm tired of recurrent, cyclical questioning that only results in a negative identity: I'm not like this, I'm not like this either, Oh fuck I'm also not like this other thing.

People close to me are pretty fucking adamant that I am /not like the other guys/ and well, it isn't any secret that I've never really felt one of them, and if you throw me into a guys-only environment chances are I'm going to either have trouble or at least stick out

Yet I'm very obviously not a girl, and even if I have thought a lot of times that I'd like to be one, it's always been more of a ""wanting to be a girl _too_"", and I very seriously don't want to have *my* body cut up.

Because why do we have to mandatorily be one-or-the-other?

I mean, it's totally cool that there are manly men and womanly women, but enforcing it just misses out on so much human potential.

I'm AMAB and I don't think I've ever felt like a cis het guy more than fleetingly. But I'm not a gay man, because I do like women. I'm pretty sure I'm bisexual, but haven't had the chance to confirm (but I don't crave it either so that's okay).

I'm also pretty sure I'm not a transwoman because trying to become an actual woman to me just sounds like locking myself further into a different form, and if at all I'd want more freedom, not less, and not ""the same freedom in different options after great toil and irreversible procedures"".

I think I'm not a crossdresser because well, I've never felt an urge to crossdress. I'd like to be able to wear some girlier clothes as a normal thing; but I don't want to split myself and I'm not into wearing dresses, blouses or makeup - just as I'm not into wearing suits, ties, or having a beard. So yeah, doing strongly gendered stuff just puts me off. 

Seriously, it's like some dial in my head has always been misaligned by a notch, or got knocked off at some point, not by a huge amount but by a small-yet-noticeable-amount that shows itself almost everywhere sooner or later.

SAGE said that I ""socialize androginously"" and the combined whatever inventory for MtFs called me ""androgyne"" (and kinda shrugged to the point that a digital self-report test can shrug) - For what that kind of thing is worth.

Trying to look at myself as non-binary, or just as ""other"" gives me a drive to be more in control of my body and to do things that before I just didn't see the point of doing, BOTH boy-coded and girl-coded things.  It makes me look forward.

I'm started to feel convinced it just makes a whole lot more sense.

And now, for those that read the whole thing, here's a little joke translated from my mother tongue:

There are three babies awake in the neonatal unit of a hospital.
Looking at the immediate surroundings, one of the babies says: ""Hey, looks like I'm a boy, because they gave me blue socks!"", which prompted the next baby to say ""And they gave me pink socks, so I guess I'm a girl?"". After a while, the third baby chimes in with great consternation: ""Guys, I'm fucked. I don't know what I am - My balls are so big I can't see my fucking socks!!""

Hi r/nonbinary!

I am an AFAB, bisexual enby. Lived my whole life dysmorphic as all hell, finally found the identity and presentation that makes me feel at home in my own skin. My husband is SO supportive and honestly a huge blessing in the face of such a dichotomous society. Not really in a place to change my name/pronouns, but I buzzed my hair and bought my first binder! Yay!

I have a job working with college students on the Autism spectrum. Through some underhanded “queer competition” I ended up getting pressured into coming out in my office. It’s a pretty typical office setting but I’m definitely the youngest of the “professional” office staff, working with college students on the spectrum as well as student mentors. 

I thought in an office full of generally aware humans and social workers, it would be more effective to get ahead of everything. So I came out to my boss (approx 30ish) and an older coworker (probs 45?). I just plainly presented myself, acknowledging my physical presentation bc I tend to feel more comfortable in Masc business casual clothes. I stated what my gender identity and sexuality were and the fact that I’m pretty strongly rooted in the LGBTQ+ population. 

Fast forward to last week. My boss took an opportunity when we were alone to kinda confirm my sexuality since she was confused. It was humble and appropriate and I felt respected. No stress. 

Yesterday, my coworker told me that she and my supervisor had to google what “non binary is” and it resulted in an EXTREMELY uncomfortable and unexpected conversation with someone who is entirely disconnected from the LGBTQ community. She flip flopped between “my generation just doesn’t care about bedroom business” and “I’m just so curious, how do they do it?” (In reference to trans acquaintances.) Sparing some of the worst parts, it was probably the lowest I’ve been since coming to terms with my gender ID myself. I will always be willing to educate and converse. I don’t think any of the conversation was meant to be combative. I just didn’t anticipate having this conversation with an adult and not a student with ASD who would struggle to understand “grey” in their very black vs white world. Those conversations have been fine, probably because they weren’t blindsiding. 

So, friends, are there any good resources out there to help enbys who want to be themselves and educate others without reinventing the wheel? What helped you feel confident and out without this one portion of your identity overshadowing the other awesome parts of you?

I don't know how they would react if I were to come out but I'm fairly certain that it will not be a very positive reaction. This means that I probably won't come out to them until I've moved out and am in a financially stable place and as much as I would like to go on T, I probably won't be able to until then.\n\nAlso, I'm scared that the whole thing is something that I've made up and something in my head. You see, my closest friend is transmasculine and I watch multiple trans and non-binary Youtubers. I'm afraid that I'm just taking on their experiences and their insecurities and projecting them onto myself.\n\nTL;DR So yeah basically, should I introduce myself by my new name / pronouns at university despite having unsupportive parents and being somewhat uncertain of my gender identity?"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'Dilemna', 'created': 1518445369.0}"

115,2018-02-15 15:27:06,7xr294,1,10,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like “I support trans rights” already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

143,2018-02-19 06:18:58,7ykoyn,6,5,"So, most of my life I've had a complicated relationship with my gender. I tried transitioning from ftm when I was 20. I felt really uncomfortable with the pressure to be more masculine than I am, and ended up transitioning back to female. I spent a few more years ignoring the confusion and just trying to get by in life, and not really thinking about why I felt so deeply annoyed with being perceived as female all the time. Now, after returning to school and meeting a whole bunch of young adults who have all these wonderful new words to describe gender, I feel like I'm starting to be a lot more honest with myself and my own gender. With that comes a lot of that old dysphoria I'd learned to shove deep into the closet again. 

But I'm also not a guy. I learned that already. I'm a person who should have a beard, a deep voice, and a ballin makeup game, but doesn't. 

I still fluctuate between masc and femme. But I've been wanting more and more to go on T, I have a queer doctor now who would happily make that happen if I talked to her about it, and I'm very conflicted. While I know I'd feel happy if the entire world was a Queer Island and I could go anywhere being my sparkly, bearded self, I'm terrified of the reality of violence against trans women and feminine men, and I know from experience it is safer in some ways to be a masculine-presenting woman than it is to be a feminine-presenting man; it is somewhat safer to be a trans man than a trans woman; and I'm familiar with the territory of safety I have as the body I currently own. Going on T will mean that while my own identity has not shifted, the way the world sees me will shift and I do not know that territory. 

So. Perspectives? Does anyone who operates as a masculine-perceived person with noticeable feminine qualities have any insight, positive or negative experiences, advice, etc. you are willing and able to share? 

Much appreciated and much love,

I don't like how it looks, how it feels, or dealing with it.

I have unavoidable greyface, I can't help cutting myself every time I shave, it's so bristly it stings on the inside.

So I kind of want it gone off the face of this treacherous world, but I'm scared of potential consequences, whether people will freak out, or give me a lot of shit, or if I'll look horrible, etc.

I'm dearly convinced they love me both despite and for what I'm like, in a general sense, which is mostly the same I feel for them, and I guess that's the reason we're friends.

But there's still something hard to pin down that puzzles me to no end.

On one hand, they have pushed and prodded and pricked me into questioning, several times along my life, in various ways.

On the other hand, whenever I've tried to reach, talking with them, any conclusion about myself more solid than a fleeting ""I don't think I feel inside like most other people with dicks"", suddenly I'm not to be taken seriously - I'm probably just bored and need to conjure up problems when there are none.

That somehow I was ""less standard"" than the soft, sassy, beautiful fat kid of a gay man he has for spouse (yes, they're happily married) torn me up inside to no end.

And yet I'm discouraged from developing a substantive identity; and from acknowledging how deep it runs, that it's not _only_ a superficial thing.

All of this, together with the fact that I don't like neopronouns for myself, sum up the reasons why I won't socially transition or give any explanations unless I've got everything already well underway.

As we were catching up, I felt great vibes coming from the conversation, and I suddenly felt like sharing a little more than the usual 'guy' fluff. I started by saying, I'd decided to focus on self improvement this year, and that I'd decided to try therapy, since it was covered by insurance.

He was intrigued and excited; asked me how I liked it so far?  He'd had rough times in the past, and had thought seeing someone would have helped. 

I told him it was great! I was having fun, finding ways to improve my marriage and be more empathetic. I told him... I'd been feeling sort of confined by stereotypical masculinity.

...That's it.

* I didn't tell him I was questioning my gender.
* I didn't tell him I might be trans or non-binary.
* I didn't tell him I was curious about hormones.

-even though I am, to all of those things. Just a *sliver* of a hint: ""I'm feeling a little trapped by masculinity.""

He immediately agreed; ""yeah, man! They even have a name for it now: 'toxic masculinity,' right? It's all bullshit, trying to tell boys they can't have feelings. I know how you feel!""

And then we played some more video games. We spent the day hanging out, chatting and playing games. When it was time to head back to work life, we brought it in for a hug.

I realized I don't hug friends enough.

Write about your gender. 

... 

My gender is James. I have always been James, I think. Or maybe they grew up out of the fresh earth decayed from Lex or Wander or Deadname. I do not know, I can't find out. I do not care. 

James is now. James is this year. James is candor and pain and scary conversations about pronouns and how much 'James' I can be. 

James is a one-syllable word with the same first letter of my deadname. It is also the name of a (in my opinion) flamboyantly genderqueer character from the Pokémon anime. It is my name. I chose it in thirty seconds, tops. And now people call me that. I think I like it. 

James calls themself male, but really, they're not. Body dysphoria or whatever aside ('cause who cares honestly), deep down, James sexually identifies as a punk. Not a girl, not a boy, not a xeumel or the other X-words people have put a lot of thought into. Just a punk. 
Even though you don't need to be a punk to be a CripplePunk, I'm both. My gender is CripplePunk, is Queercrip, is identity politics no matter what. 

That's probably unhealthy, isn't it? 

I don't care. 

I am James. My skin is pallor-white and laced with starry scars from things I cannot talk about. My body is webbed and curved and bony, but as I wait I feel it getting softer. I am excited to feel myself growing layers of squish, of fat, of forgiveness. It makes me proud. 

My personality is quite shit. I've been told that many times by people who also have quite shit personalities, but also by people who are quite nice or in between. I don't really care. I'm an extrovert, but years of parental neglect has made other people's opinions on my character not really matter to me. I can get by with a few very little love kernels from people I like. 

I don't need many validation kernels for my gender either. Being called a girl doesn't even hurt anymore. It just feels numb. Maybe it carries a faint hot stinging that radiates up from my chest for half a second and then dissipates. Sometimes being called a boy does that too. I mean, I like ""male"" terms sometimes — boyfriend, husband, 'sir' maybe. Things that used to make me quake from happiness sometimes still feel quite nice. But it's all relative. 

Now I feel euphoric when I'm called ""Mx."" James has been writing this poem in a mixture of first and third person because they like when people use they/them pronouns, it feels sharp and clear and like something other than the numb 's/he's I have convinced myself I don't care about. 

I mean, if someone must err, I'd rather they erred on the side of ""he"" rather than ""she."" ""He"" is what I will one day settle for, when I am an adult who speaks a gendered language. I am sure one day it will feel acceptable. 

But back when I still felt euphoria, I felt it for my queerness, for my certainty and freedom granted within for all eternity by my enbyhood. For that one day, it glittered, it ached. It was— 

It was everything I knew and everything I wanted, stitched into my skin and plastered onto me, into me, crochet and braided lanyards and embroidered tapestry all at once, 
All over me, inescapable — 
Mx., They/them 

I'm such a loser 
(And I don't care! Or at least, I'm trying not to.) 



But the mocking internal voice of my ""true transsexual"" scum former self makes it feel ridiculous, impossible, illegitimate and pointless to desire 
So when it's not respected, should I care? 
Do I even have a right to? 
If I am one in a hundred, one in a thousand, one in a something and my feeling is unique and unnameable and psychotic and unreal (?¿?), does it count at all? 
Maybe so, maybe not 
I don't care 
I am too scared to talk about it still 

And yet, and yet, I hope every day that somebody will acknowledge it 
I hope day after day, like I did before, and it never happened, never happens 
That's okay 
It's time to leave it 
For another day.

8,2018-02-01 20:55:45,7ulxrv,5,12,"I'll try to keep it relatively short, I would just appreciate some advice.. One of my best friends is trans, he came out about four years ago. Since then, he goes by his new name and all of his friends are really supportive, which is great. Problem is, his parents are in full denial. They only call him by his birth name, won't look into the topic at all and avoid talking about it. We all try our best to support him as effectively as possible, but of course the situation with his parents weights him down a lot and lately his depression, anxiety and dismorphia have been getting worse and worse and it breaks my heart.

We've talked about how badly he wants to start HRT once but then never again because he hates that topic - he describes it as a dream that'll never come true anyway and is just too depressing to even think about. Like seeing that one bright thing that you want more than anything else in life but it's completely out of reach. 

And that's the thing, because I don't really see why it'd be impossible. He's of age and I've looked into it and here in Germany, health insurance would absorb the costs, the only thing he needs is an affirmation from his psychiatrist and a few general health checks and stuff. He wouldn't even have to discuss it with his parents and wouldn't need their approval either.

I think the point that keeps him from going through with HRT is that he doesn't want to ""disappoint"" his parents and family and he's scared of how a transition would affect their relationship. I completely understand that because their relationship has been really good up until his outing and he still loves them - while they love their ""daughter"" and he's scared of rejection.

One of my best friends is trans, he came out about four years ago. Since then, he goes by his new name and all of his friends are really supportive, which is great. Problem is, his parents are in full denial. They only call him by his birth name, won\'t look into the topic at all and avoid talking about it. We all try our best to support him as effectively as possible, but of course the situation with his parents weights him down a lot and lately his depression, anxiety and dismorphia have been getting worse and worse and it breaks my heart.\n\nWe\'ve talked about how badly he wants to start HRT once but then never again because he hates that topic - he describes it as a dream that\'ll never come true anyway and is just too depressing to even think about. Like seeing that one bright thing that you want more than anything else in life but it\'s completely out of reach. \n\nAnd that\'s the thing, because I don\'t really see why it\'d be impossible. He\'s of age and I\'ve looked into it and here in Germany, health insurance would absorb the costs, the only thing he needs is an affirmation from his psychiatrist and a few general health checks and stuff. He wouldn\'t even have to discuss it with his parents and wouldn\'t need their approval either.\n\nI think the point that keeps him from going through with HRT is that he doesn\'t want to ""disappoint"" his parents and family and he\'s scared of how a transition would affect their relationship. I completely understand that because their relationship has been really good up until his outing and he still loves them - while they love their ""daughter"" and he\'s scared of rejection. \n\nBut it\'s become more and more obvious that he can\'t keep going like this either and I\'m really worried about him.

A short while ago I was ready to be patient. I was willing to hold off on any surgeries while I let hormones do their work. I was going to wait until I was as close to fully passing as I felt I was going to get before going under the knife.


But now, I just want to move forward with things. I will soon begin the hunt for someone to do a tracheal shave and I am beginning electrolysis in mid-march.


I am still very masculine (being 6'2 with big shoulders will do that), but I am finally started noticing the changes I was promised. I see the more feminine aspects more clearly. I feel different on so many levels.


But as the days tick by, I find myself desperately wanting to get SRS more and more. It went from that thing that I eagerly awaited to something that I feel I need to help make my life worth living, and I don't know if that scares me or just makes me confident that when the time comes, I will be emotionally ready.


But everything feels like it's slowing down, like those future steps are never quite going to arrive. I have my money saved, a job that lets me work from home, and a great support group, but I just feel like I'm in this zone of not being able to do anything.

So this is my first real time talking to anyone about or even just voicing my thoughts about being trans. I think I've known for a long time but either haven't been able to piece things together or have just been lying to myself. I guess just the usual signs of gravitating towards feminine rolls in games as a child (and video games now), wanting to do girly stuff like makeup/nails, and some crossdressing.

So at the very least I'm not in denial anymore even though I still have a slew of doubts. However I'm slightly freaking out about what to do next.

My little sister is almost 10 years old. I'd say from the time she was about 5 my family and I had noticed that she was more tom-boy than anything. This didn't come as a surprise, as most of the women in my family (including my mother and myself) were very tom-boyish growing up.

She prefers ""boy"" toys, like cars and nerf guns rather than ""girl"" toys like dolls and makeup. She doesn't like princesses much but really loves spiderman and lots of ""boyish"" things. 

When she was around 7 years old she felt very uncomfortable wearing dresses and she refused to wear a one piece or two piece bathing suit. She asked my mother for swim shorts and a surf top to go swimming in. My family is very open and accepting and we've never questioned or cared and we happily let her wear whatever she wants (as long as it's appropriate for her age, of course).

She has said a few times in the past that she wishes she were a boy and she *only* shops in the boy section for clothes. 

She wouldn't sleep in her room, that was painted purple, for years and slept on the couch in the living room. She claimed she was afraid of the dark. Her room was recently painted blue, and she now sleeps in there every night. 

So.... What can I do? If she is in fact transgendered I want her to be comfortable and aware that's it's perfectly okay.

Any advice, incite, sharing comparable experiences, etc.. All would be of great appreciation. ', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'I feel stuck... Please give me incite', 'created': 1518690577.0}"

83,2018-02-15 17:36:55,7xs00p,2,26,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Please take 10 min to complete a positive response. You can find a guide and link to the consultation at

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like “I support trans rights” already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

I’m about 6 weeks into my trans journey and in some ways I’ve been rocketing down this life-road with the gas pedal glued firmly to the floor, I am not exaggerating to say that reading about trans things has consumed 90% of my free time in the last month and a half. Yet, so much I don’t know, and in other ways i’m still recently hatched. But my current conundrum or block to progress is this:

1) I know I want to be a woman.

2) I don’t think I am a woman.

3) I don’t know if I can become a woman.

I can still call myself trans because that first one is very strong. I want to be a woman badly. In my life I have very rarely cared deeply about anything or desired/wanted things, physical or otherwise. But even in my more despairing moments if I ask myself if I still want this, the answer is always a strong yes. This answer is also why I think i’m mtf and not nb

The second point is mostly where I want opinions. As strongly as I want to be a woman, I don’t feel like I am or have ever been a woman deep inside. To be fair, i don’t particularly feel like man either and I’m still kinda resentful of masculinity as a general concept.

So my main question is for those of you who have been on this path longer than I have, how much does #2 change over time? Do you start to feel more and more like you are your gender? It seems like most people started by saying “I am &lt;gender&gt;” (#2) and then had to struggle to accept “I want to be &lt;gender&gt;” (#1) for themselves, and i’m just backwards. But this might just be the standard narrative and it’s not actually how most people experience their gender transition. I don’t know.

And #3 is mostly that when I do fem things like lipstick or clothing, it doesn’t make me feel like more of a lady. It doesn’t help #2. I do sometimes get strong emotional reactions to a bra or a dress, so something’s certainly happening deep in the back of my skull, but it's mostly crying and frustration and not affirming feelings.

So, dear internet, on the scale of one cat to all the cats. Please tell me if this is reasonably typical.

113,2018-02-20 17:22:05,7yxmkb,5,1,"Hello,

Very soon I will finally be able to start my transition (MTF) but there is still a problem I still don't know how I will solve: hair.

Everyone talks about lazer hair removal and electrolysis but I absolutly can't afford this, not now and not anytime soon either.

So I was wondering how I could get rid of my hair with little money.

Everything I tried yet wasn't effective:

- Trimmer: Didn't cut much
- Depilatory cream: Caused hurtfull bloody red dots on my thighs (the friction of my pants against my thighs still hurt even several days later) and left some remaining hair
- Shaving (disposable razor): Chicken skin effect and bloody red dots on my thighs
- Hot wax hair removal at the esthetician: Many more bloody red dots on my thighs. The esthetician said it would go away in 2 days, it took 2 weeks. My hair grew back by the time my legs recovered. Moreover, I can't afford to pay the esthetician every 2 weeks.

These hair remains to me the most important obstacle between me and my feminity. If some of you had the same problems, I hope you can give me precise advice.

(Pleeeeease don't tell me off for mocking dementia - I live with hers. I know. Call it affection, a coping strategy, reclamation, I don't care which.)

Your granddaughter"", her response is usually something like, ""I didn't realise I had another granddaughter,"" or ""Aren't you tall for a girl?"" Which yes, sisters, I am. 

But secondly, this whole ""becoming a different person to her"", might not've even been necessary. Because in her oldies singing club today, a trans lady came in and sang a song on her guitar, etc. and my mum said that driving nan home in the car, she said ""We had someone in playing the guitar today, but you know, I wasn't sure if it was a man or a woman!""

Getting top surgery before going on hormones actually easier in my country. I visited a therapist for a referral letter but she denied it, she said i'm too young and confused for this. (I'm 20 and i wanted to start transitioning since i was 14 by the way.)

So i thought getting top surgery first would be a good start. So i can go on hormones later on  when i can &amp; want to. But don't know if it's a really good idea or not.. many people say you have to be on hormones to get the surgeries because of the body changes etc.

145,2018-02-26 16:47:10,80eec4,13,19,"When I was growing up, I had a really really deep voice (think somewhere between Garth Brooks and George Ezra). I've spent so much time on vocal training thst my voice is indistinguishable from that of a cis woman's, in fact I'm in the higher ranges. My partner has a naturally higher voice (she is cis), and we've had people tell us thst she and I sound a lot alike, almost indistinguishable. It just takes time and methodology and constant practice.

What you're aiming for is to change where your voice resonates from. Most men, and those of us who were assigned male at birth, have resonance points in our chest. Women, and those assigned female at birth, typically have higher resonance points, somewhere between the clavicle and nose. I currently sit somewhere around my lower jaw/upper neck. You can feel this if you put your hands on your chest and neck (2 fingers works just fine, you don't need to use your whole hand. No need to choke yourself here (leave that for the bedroom if that's what you're into 😉)

What I recommend is thst you sing along to higher pitched artists (I admit, I started off with Cher, who is very low in vocal range, but I moved up to Ruth B., Kate Voegle, Sarah Berelias, and even Jasmin Thompson).

I also recommend that you watch the videos on trans voice 101 by Stef Sanjati on youtube. ~~I don't have the links handy right this second~~, but her older one is the one I used to train my voice.

[old video](https://youtu.be/q6eTvS2wIUc)

[newer video](https://youtu.be/Ah5DGHXbKmk)

I also practiced every waking moment, and I work as the main cashier in a very busy retail bookstore in the south/eastern part of the US. It took time, and not everyone was so supportive of me doing so, but that just fueled my determination. Within 2-3 months I was within normal female range all the time. After 6 months I discovered it was difficult to drop back down at all and speaking with my feminine voice was incredibly natural to me. And now, at a year and a half of self taught vocal training, it's really really difficult to drop, and I can't even get all the way back down. 

It's also very important to remember to breath properly and not sound nasally, or overly valley-girl. Just talk like the cis women around you. Pay attention to how they speak.

I do think it's worth noting that if you use someone who has a different accent than you do as a model for your voice that you could develop some words that are within that verbal accent. Because of that I say Sorry like a Canadian, Water like I'm from the UK, and a few others. You can train yourself out of it, or just enjoy the little quirks  (like I do).

I will be putting the links up shortly. I've received several messages in the past asking how I got to wear I am, and I am always willing to video chat, or just talk on discord, with any of you.

The changes are slow, and you won't notice the changes immediately, but over time it will change. Record a short video of you speaking, and then every couple of months record another one. You will be surprised the differences when compared month to month rather than day to day. This also helps you identify what aspect of your voice you should work on. Feel free to discontinue whenever you feel comfortable. 

**Now for trans men**. I recommend all the steps above but in reverse. You want a lower resonance point, and I recommend singing a long to some deeper pitched artists (start with Ruth B and Cher, and work your way down to some of the deeper male artists like George Ezra or Garth Brooks.)

I admit, I have little experience with this, but it stands to reason (in my mind) that the same can be achieved by doing the exact opposite. You guys also have the added benifet that hormones WILL help with this. It takes time. The changes are slow, and you won't notice the changes immediately, but over time it will change.

So to make a long story short I've been looking up GQ/NB folks online to try and feel a bit less alone since I live in a conservative rural area and being out is like ""nope, not a chance"". I'm not really finding a lot of gender presentation that matches mine. There are a lot of AFAB enby folks who like short hair and makeup and that's awesome, you do you, but I'm not finding a lot of me out there and it's a bit lonely.

If I could point to my gender, I'd point to pretty boys from yaoi manga and video games. I have long hair and a feminine name (haven't changed it, not planning to for complex reasons), though I wear absolutely zero makeup (hate it!). Most people gender me as female though some seem to realize that's not quite right (including bullies back in my school days 20 years ago who used to like to call me 'manbeast'). I have a long list of 'stereotypically masculine' interests that involve playing video games and fixing things.

And I'm kind of like... OK where I'm at. I'm not considering HRT, in part due to a thyroid problem that needs continual monitoring, but also because my body's not been terrible to me... I don't have a huge chest, and on dysphoria days I can usually hide pretty well under a couple baggy layers. I even have a little bit of upper lip hair that I've grown to love.

Anyone else out there feel the same way? That they're fine with their birth name and presentation without social changes or medical intervention, but still strongly ID as GQ/NB?

I don't really want to look like a man or a woman, but androgynous.

I feel weird saying that, but I look at porn~ let's call it art, or characters like that, and I can't help but feel like that's what I should be.

I've been out as a queer person for a couple years now, but recently got my name and gender marker changed on my ID, which led to a ton of questions from my friends - so maybe I wasn't as out as I thought. I crafted this letter and posted it on my FB and it got a lot of positive response from my cis friends who asked to share it with their other cis friends to be educated as well. 

Thought I'd share it here too. 

PSA: 

I have gone through expensive legal channels to change my name to Snarfy and I would like you to please start calling me Snarfy instead of Oldname.

The X on my ID stands for ""Non-Binary"" which means, to me, that I don't identify as a woman or a man, but somewhere outside of those/mix of both. The honorific for this is ""Mx."" which is pronounced as ""mix"". I am Mx. Lastname. ""Excuse me , Mx, is this your coat?"" 

I use they/them pronouns, which means that instead of using she/her or he/him when you talk about me, I would like you to use they/them. 

""This is Snarfy! They do my hair!""
""Oh, Snarfy left their phone behind, I do hope they come and get it!"" 
""Snarfy sent me a message, I wonder what they want?"" 

The gender neutral term for ""sister/brother"" is ""Sibling""
The gender neutral term that I use for ""aunt/uncle"" is ""Auncle"" 
The gender neutral term for ""niece/nephew"" is ""Nibling"" 
The gender neutral term for ""wife/husband"" is ""Spouse"" 
The gender neutral term I use for ""gf/bf"" is ""sweetie"" or ""babefriend"" 
The gender neutral term for ""mother/father"" is ""parent"" - but I still use mom/mama/mother because it feels right. 

Changing the way we talk about eachother and the way we talk about loved ones can be difficult at first, and it can take a lot of practice to get it right. It can feel overwhelming and like you keep making mistakes, but it's okay to make mistakes! Just correct yourself and move on. No need to make a fuss. I believe in you. &lt;3

The honorific for this is ""Mx."" which is pronounced as ""mix"". I am Mx. Lastname. ""Excuse me , Mx, is this your coat?"" \n\nI use they/them pronouns, which means that instead of using she/her or he/him when you talk about me, I would like you to use they/them. \n\n""This is Snarfy! They do my hair!""\n""Oh, Snarfy left their phone behind, I do hope they come and get it!"" \n""Snarfy sent me a message, I wonder what they want?"" \n\nThe gender neutral term for ""sister/brother"" is ""Sibling""\nThe gender neutral term that I use for ""aunt/uncle"" is ""Auncle"" \nThe gender neutral term for ""niece/nephew"" is ""Nibling"" \nThe gender neutral term for ""wife/husband"" is ""Spouse"" \nThe gender neutral term I use for ""gf/bf"" is ""sweetie"" or ""babefriend"" \nThe gender neutral term for ""mother/father"" is ""parent"" - but I still use mom/mama/mother because it feels right. \n\nChanging the way we talk about eachother and the way we talk about loved ones can be difficult at first, and it can take a lot of practice to get it right. It can feel overwhelming and like you keep making mistakes, but it\'s okay to make mistakes! Just correct yourself and move on. No need to make a fuss. I believe in you. &lt;3 \n\nThank you for showing that you respect me by using my name and pronouns.', 'subreddit': 'genderqueer', 'title': 'My coming out post on FB', 'created': 1517732348.0}"

My sex is female (AFAB). My gender identity is something I’ve been having a hard time defining. Having breasts (even though they are tiny/B-cup) frustrates and upsets me and doesn’t make me feel good about myself. I have tried binding before and the way it made my chest look was very affirming. However, I also have chronic shoulder/upper back/ribcage pain and so a binder is not doable on a regular basis (I can’t even wear bras regularly either b/c of this.) I have contemplated top surgery, which I would want to include nipple removal (is that even a thing??)
As far as expression, the gender binary is not something I fully identify with and I find it hard to put my “style” into a box. 99% of the time I just wear what is comfortable, I don’t wear makeup or do my hair... or put any thought into what gender I might be perceived as. But for super special occasions I gravitate towards the more “feminine” style. Sometimes I’ll even get my hair and makeup done, and although the process is a huge pain, I feel good about myself. (Minus the breasts always ruining everything). 
My facial structure is very naturally androgynous, and without makeup (which I hate wearing - mostly the whole process of it) I have had a couple people ask me if I am MTF trans. Doesn’t help that I’m super hairy/fuzzy - got those genes from my dad. 
I would like to do something about the hair, because I don’t like my body hair in general, and I was thinking of doing laser hair removal. But I also feel really confused about how I feel about my facial structure. I’ve started googling things like “afab hrt more feminine”... “cis androgynous female hormones for more feminine facial structure” &amp; etc. (even though I don’t truly identify with “cis” but idk what to call myself.) I’m finding a lot of genderqueer folks looking into HRT to become more androgynous. I haven’t found anyone who feels like I do...and it makes me feel like I don’t belong here, either.

my other friend was a lot more supportive (i was actually expecting him to freak out), when i told him he said ""I respect what you want too do with your life,aslong as you stay my friend"" and he was actually apologizing if he messes up (on names/pronouns ect.) which is more then i could really ask for and i really appreciate it.

he just said ok and he called me it again (sarcasticly again but still i didnt like it)

29,2018-02-07 08:54:03,7vusz2,2,5,"Hey fellow queers and dears. Just some background - I've been out pretty much since I learned non-binary was a word. But I never properly came out and told everyone I knew exactly how I think about it.

I got into a bit of an argument today regarding how my dearest friend thought of trans women... She's a feminist of the Jermaine Greer fangirl variety. I was a little disgusted by the venom in her voice and when I questioned her she told me that a 'man' has no right to tell her how to be a feminist...
I have Autistic Syndrome Disorder and it's been playing havoc with my speech skills for years. I couldn't get the right words out. I couldn't get her to think about it from the perspective I was trying to look from... So I hung up the phone. Weeped a little and composed... Well this.

&gt; 💜💛💚💙❤  So... 

I've changed a lot and not at all in the last two years. June 2016 I discovered a new word that suddenly opened up a future for me. Instead of looking into the future and seeing a grey old man with a miserable smile I suddenly saw a bright, beaming silver-haired creature. I saw a vision of my future that had some genuine happiness in it. That was it. I wouldn't hold back.
I'm non-binary. A trans person. Born male and for twenty odd years trapped in a definition which stifled and corroded me.
Now personally I don't give a damn what most people think of me... Otherwise I'd never be able to rest - ""Blokes don't wear makeup!"" ""How can you be both?"" ""What the fuck is that?!"" I got past that kind of shit in high school, 'crime against nature' and whatnot.

Where this philosophy breaks down is with the people I love and adore. My family; for the most part willing to at least listen and accept it. My friends; no trouble there, misfits and reprobates the lot of them... But that's all directed at me.

I'm not worried about me. My personality might be gentle but it's unyielding. What makes me cry is the idea that the people I love, that the woman I admire the most might not accept those who come after me. The little boys who grow up and discover their body betraying them, bleeding against their will. The little girls who are barred from their peers because they can't experience being a woman without the 'right' parts. The adorable creatures who see the binary and know they don't belong there deep in their queer little hearts.

I don't know if you'll read this as you've voluntarily taken yourself away from this boring blue site but maybe it'll reach you. I hope it does, you know better than anyone I'm much better at writing this stuff down than trying to finagle it from my disobedient tongue.

I cry everytime I think I might not be able to make a difference for the kids that grow up from here on.
That someone my age or beyond might advocate hate or simply not accept these children for what they are.

I want this world, my world, my tiny little corner of Tasmania to be a safer place for them.

I'm queer, transgender and extraordinarily okay with it. 
Anyone who has a problem with that... Bring it on.
Anyone who accepts that without hesitation... Bring your love.
Anyone who wants to understand... Bring an open mind.

And anyone who can't see past a parroted line of rhetoric from an Elder constantly looking at the past... I hope you find your own voice deep down one day.

Thank you. ❤💙💚💛💜

Just some background - I\'ve been out pretty much since I learned non-binary was a word. But I never properly came out and told everyone I knew exactly how I think about it.\n\nI got into a bit of an argument today regarding how my dearest friend thought of trans women... She\'s a feminist of the Jermaine Greer fangirl variety. I was a little disgusted by the venom in her voice and when I questioned her she told me that a \'man\' has no right to tell her how to be a feminist...\nI have Autistic Syndrome Disorder and it\'s been playing havoc with my speech skills for years. I couldn\'t get the right words out. I couldn\'t get her to think about it from the perspective I was trying to look from... So I hung up the phone. Weeped a little and composed... Well this.\n\n&gt; 💜💛💚💙❤  So... \n\nI\'ve changed a lot and not at all in the last two years. June 2016 I discovered a new word that suddenly opened up a future for me. Instead of looking into the future and seeing a grey old man with a miserable smile I suddenly saw a bright, beaming silver-haired creature.

68,2018-02-15 15:25:10,7xr1tm,4,26,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Please take 10 min to complete a positive response. You can find a guide and link to the consultation at

**http://equalrecognition.scot/consultation/**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like “I support trans rights” already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

I\'ve also really been looking forward to a new job where I can just introduce myself as Kestrel and not have to ""come out."" Fast forward again to Wednesday:\n\n""Hey *deadname*, it\'s HR Lady from That Company! We got funding for the position back. Are you still interested? Why don\'t you come over and meet with the team lead?""\n\nI should have corrected her right then, but decided I would just roll with it. I can always correct them at the meeting.\n\nFriday morning, I arrive at the office and the team lead meets me at the front door. ""Hey *deadname*! Remember me?"" I did because he was one of the people I interviewed with. I didn\'t even think of correcting him about my name either. I\'d already put on my super-personable face and was in people-pleaser mode. The next thing I knew, I\'d been introduced to everyone I\'d be working with as my dead name.\n\nThe meeting went really well and I was told I\'d have a job offer in my email by Monday. I should be excited, but I\'m not. I hate the idea of coming out to strangers as NB. If I\'d just corrected HR Lady, I wouldn\'t have to.

I definitely don't feel like a woman (but don't really feel like a man either), but my current life doesn't allow me to present myself as anything other than a ""normal"" straight cisgender woman.  I live in the Bible Belt and I have very close-minded family members.  I'll try not to go into too many details, but in brief, my family responded with utter disgust and hatred way back in my early 20s when I first started dating women and presenting myself in a more masculine way.  Emotional abuse throughout my childhood had crippled me mentally, emotionally, and socially, and I wasn't able to find the strength or independence to be myself and ignore the haters.  I retreated back into the proverbial closet and turned to various forms of religious extremism to try to ""straighten"" myself out.  Now, here I am nearly 40.  I have two children from a miserable marriage to a man that I could barely stand to have sex with.  I love my children dearly, but trying to be ""motherly"" to them forces me to keep up this charade of femininity that is killing me.  Plus, I've done a lot of crazy things in my life, largely due to all the crap I've dealt with from my manipulative and hateful family members, and my parents have used this against me (plus a lot of exaggerations and flat-out lies) to get legal guardianship of my kids.  So the only way I can be with my children is for me and the kids to live with my parents.  I have to keep being the person my parents want me to be.

So I'm stuck pretending to be someone I'm not.  One of the biggest agonies for me is my breasts.  After two pregnancies and breast-feeding, they are these two big, saggy monstrosities that feel like mutations or tumors.  Don't get me wrong.  I LOVE breasts, when they belong to someone else!

My daughter is only 7 and has this obsession with me having long curly hair, and although I desperately want to shave my head, I have to keep my hair long to avoid breaking her heart.  She even loves to play with my hair, although I can barely stand to have anyone touch my hair (or any of me).  Sometimes it makes me twitch to be touched.  I'm very hairy for a woman, and I have to constantly remove the hair on my face to avoid having a beard.  I wish I could just let it grow.  But my family can barely even stomach the fact that I don't shave my legs or pits.  I work in retail and thus have to interact with co-workers and customers constantly, which throws me into excruciating existential agony, because this bubbly, feminine little gal with an annoyingly high-pitched voice is completely not who I really am.  The more I connect with people, the more I see and hear and feel that person I'm presenting myself as, and the more the cognitive dissonance rips me in half.  It's killing me to not recognize my own self.  The only ""me"" that feels real is that disembodied inner voice that becomes loud and clear when I'm in bed at night, my eyes closed to the outside world, as I lie still and can minimize the sensations of my bizarre and unfamiliar body.  And to top it all off, I'm horribly lonely and sex-starved.  I haven't been intimate with a woman in 17 years.

Disclaimer: I live in a very conservative town 

Ever since I've cut my hair (I'm a 'girl'), I've feel like people think I'm a weirdo or something. Every time I go out people stare(but not positives stares). I feel like every single person who passes by hates me because I'm gender non conforming. 

I've had people saying to me that they knew me, or they had seen me before, somewhere else. A person that I encountered for the first time ever, (friend of a friend) said she knew who I was. Isn't it creepy? this has happened a few times. I've had people of my school knowing my name without me knowing them. (probably because there's facebook, but, I mean...)

I can understand that there are people who like this kind of 'attention', but I don't. I never liked being an outsider or something, and I like when no one notices me. Which is the opposite of what happens. If it was positive attention, if people were genuinely interested in me because they liked me, I would be happy, no problem.

But I feel 'observed'. Every move I take, every time I go grocery shopping, the normal activities, etc. people stare and probably think: - oh is it a boy or a girl? what a shame. Is she like, trans? or a lesbian?-

What irritates me the most is not the fact that people might talk about me behind my back, but the fact that all they see is a girl who is 'trying' to be weird and eccentric. While I should be a boy, my name should be Kevin, but no one will ever see me as that for two years.

I was born female and up until recently I’ve identified that way, but lately I’ve been really wondering what my gender/gender identity truly is.
So, all my life I’ve been actively attempting to dress/look like a guy. I didn’t realize I was doing this until about a month ago. Even as a kid I’d do this. I love suits and ties and sneakers and vests. I hate dresses and pink and frilly stuff. I used to ask my mom if I looked handsome when I was very young, and she’d always correct me and say only boys can look handsome. Now I’m twenty and she routinely shouts at me for ‘trying to dress like a boy’, and I honestly had no clue what she was talking about until recently. 
I didn’t realize it. Every Halloween and at every comic con, I pick a male character just so I have an excuse to wear their clothes. And I have always felt more comfortable in men’s clothing in general, whether that’s T-shirt’s or polos or boxers or whatever. And last year, I chopped all my hair off at the salon and it’s been so nice having it short.
Yesterday, I binded for the first time (safely), and I felt so free. I was confident at work and felt way less anxious around people (I have bad social anxiety). 
But at the same time, I hate body hair and love to wear makeup, and I don’t like the idea of using male pronouns. I also hate it when people call me ‘young man’. It makes me feel ashamed.
So, basically, what I’m wondering is, wtf am I? 
I took a suuuuuper long gender test created by scientists a month ago and it told me I was androgynous (with the possibility of being trans) and I thought that was interesting &amp; I liked that term for a while as my identifier, but now I don’t know.

I wasn’t sure where else to go to ask this question, so hopefully it’s okay that I’m posting it here. \nI was born female and up until recently I’ve identified that way, but lately I’ve been really wondering what my gender/gender identity truly is.\nSo, all my life I’ve been actively attempting to dress/look like a guy. I didn’t realize I was doing this until about a month ago. Even as a kid I’d do this. I love suits and ties and sneakers and vests. I hate dresses and pink and frilly stuff. I used to ask my mom if I looked handsome when I was very young, and she’d always correct me and say only boys can look handsome. Now I’m twenty and she routinely shouts at me for ‘trying to dress like a boy’, and I honestly had no clue what she was talking about until recently. \nI didn’t realize it. Every Halloween and at every comic con, I pick a male character just so I have an excuse to wear their clothes. And I have always felt more comfortable in men’s clothing in general, whether that’s T-shirt’s or polos or boxers or whatever. And last year, I chopped all my hair off at the salon and it’s been so nice having it short.\nYesterday, I binded for the first time (safely), and I felt so free. I was confident at work and felt way less anxious around people (I have bad social anxiety). \nBut at the same time, I hate body hair and love to wear makeup, and I don’t like the idea of using male pronouns. I also hate it when people call me ‘young man’. It makes me feel ashamed.\nSo, basically, what I’m wondering is, wtf am I? \nI took a suuuuuper long gender test created by scientists a month ago and it told me I was androgynous (with the possibility of being trans) and I thought that was interesting &amp; I liked that term for a while as my identifier, but now I don’t know. \nI feel really uncomfortable and scared not knowing.

So for years now, it has been clear to me that I have a wish my genitals were different. It took a while to figure this out. Initially I had a fascination with transitioning which I couldn’t explain. Crossdressing or living as a member of the opposite sex though was not really of interest to me. By further exploring the whole thing and by finding out  that there are FTM guys and also „nullos“ out there,  I slowly realized that this is how I’d like to be.

I don’t really have dysphoria feelings for my body or genitals. I enjoy having a beard, body hair and living as a male person. I also don’t hate my cock but I would prefer I just had a hole/„pussy“ there instead.  And it’s almost essential to think that in order to achieve an orgasm. I have also wasted hours of „research“ about how this could become reality.

Sessions with therapists haven’t brought a lot because usually it ends up with them trying to persuade me I am a woman or that I have some form of body integrity disorder which doesn’t feel to be the case for me. I have also talked to my ex about this but he didn’t really seem to get it and ended up making fun of me.

Has any of you experienced similar feelings? Do you have any suggestions about how to deal with this?

130,2018-02-25 20:55:33,807dve,11,24,"I am female, but I have never fit with the word “girl”. I don’t feel like I belong to my own gender. I see girls showing such a pride of being women, then I have tried to seek that in myself, but it just isn’t there.

I have always felt like there aren’t actual differences (beyond biological ones) between men and women, not even psychologically, because I have always felt closer to a boy than a girl, then I thought: “If I looked like a boy, nobody would question my identity even for a moment, since my behaviour is so alike boys’ behaviour; then it’s probably an outdated thing thinking that men and women have differences other than pure biological ones”. Because of this, I have always defined myself just a person, not a boy or a girl. But people tell me that psychologically the two genders do have differences. So maybe it means something, that I feel so closer to a boy, and maybe the fact isn’t that men and women don’t have differences, but that deep down I am a boy.

When I was a child, I used to dislike those I was taught were “girls colours”, as I used to dislike skirts and anything “girls-related”, and I keep doing it: I am fifteen and a half, and I don’t feel attracted to makeup at all, nor to any other sort of “girls thing”. Obviously being a woman goes way further than wearing liptick and pretty dresses, I am totally aware of it, in facts the most important point is that I can’t find any sensation inside myself which tells me “o yeah, that’s feeling woman”. Even my friends often tell me the only thing that’s between me and being a boy is a penis, and I am pleased when they tell me so, I really like that. It makes me feel good with myself. My mother tells me that having me is like having a boy as well. I love this.

What really made me move from the “I just feel a person” to the “I could be a boy” is noticing that, whenever I am in a clothes shop, I feel the urge to go to the side where boy clothing is. I really feel the necessity to go there and buy boys t-shirts, boys trousers, boys shoes… The idea of doing this makes me incredibly happy, and imagining myself with short hair and boys clothes makes me feel good as well. Til now I used to tell myself: “Women can prefer short hair and boys clothes and call themselver women, and men can wear makeup and dresses and polish their nails and call themselves men; you are just being a person”. But since I feel that good with myself even just at the thought of looking like a boy, and since I feel strange, unconfortable, a bit empty, a bit disappointed wearing girly clothes, and I absolutely can’t stand wearing dresses, makeup, nail polish and stuff, maybe it’s not just a matter of style. I don’t really care about how I dress up too, I just want to feel comfortable, and I feel very comfortable when people recognize me as a boy, as I have already told you. Anything that could make me be seen as a girl makes me upset, and I keep myself afar from it. It’s been like this since when I was a child.

Last but not least important, I want to clarify that the matter isn’t the clothing itself, since I believe clothes shouldn’t even be labelled as “men’s” or “women’s”, but it’s about the feelings this makes me feel.

What do you think about it?

P.S. I don’t live this as a problem, I am not that worried. I strongly believe anything that’s human is natural and absolutely right and worth of respect. I am seeking your help and asking your opinion because I want to enrich myself getting to know me and, as a fifteen years older who lives with a pretty close minded and xenophobe environment, I need to get in touch with outsiders who have a less outdated mentality to grow.

As a teenager, I am seeking myself, and I am quite confused. I could even discover I fit more in the word “girl” than expected, and this is what I fear most. I can’t really explain why.

I think that’s the perk of being alive: you never know.

We could be so many things that we never know who we truly are until we agree to jump into the dark well of uncertainity, questioning the whole nature of our reality.

Still, I am a bit scared of not knowing something everyone takes for granted: penis = man, vagina = woman.

131,2018-02-25 22:42:46,8084of,16,4,"First off, I totally made this account as a throwaway and got excited when the username was available. Victory.

I've had a period for 15 years and have never liked it. I was on the birth control pill from age 16 to 21 and loved the light or nearly non-existent periods I had. Everything felt more physically natural about my body at this time in my life before I started exploring my gender, that is until I ragequit taking the pill after realizing it was supporting my depression and I hated remembering to take it and freaking out when I may have forgotten.

Fast forward to today, I am sitting here dreading the monthly mess after getting a reminder from my tracking app that my period is about to come. My periods are what I would consider normal right now for a vegan, relatively active body with a copper IUD in place in my uterus. But I keep thinking, did I jump on my bike and spin enough times this month to keep it light? Will my period ruin an exciting week of hanging out with my mom and my partner's birthday weekend? Am I packing enough tampons?

*Side story - I'm in my late 20s and just discovered how awesome tampons are for my period-centric gender dysphoria. It hides everything I don't want to see during the day.*

**So here's where I'm at:**

I don't want to go on a hormonal birth control or any form of hormone or drug that would change my body. I'm really cool with my body besides having a period.

As far as I know based on what I've done in the past, regular exercise, a diet that includes lots of whole foods and lacks alcohol, plenty of daily water, yoga during my period, has all worked together to keep my period light. I'm totally ok with doing all these things. I love feeling how these decisions change my body naturally.

**What I want to ask:**

**Does anyone else have an experience like this?** I just need to be exposed to other experiences similar to mine. I'm having trouble finding anything like what I've been going through. Most stories end up with people deciding on physical changes to ease or eliminate dysphoria, and while that's great for them I am not interested in those changes. But if that's your story and a part of your story is similar, please share!

**Are there any holistic recommendations to ease menstruation symptoms that have worked for you?** I suppose this could include manifestation or tricking my mind, but I haven't yet tried to see how powerful my mind really is over my body.

I've been really hurting over this for a few years, and now that I've gotten rid of my depression and have a pretty darn good life going for myself, I want to focus on some of the things I have been barely coping with. Thank you for reading and sharing if you do!

Victory.\n\nI've had a period for 15 years and have never liked it. I was on the birth control pill from age 16 to 21 and loved the light or nearly non-existent periods I had. Everything felt more physically natural about my body at this time in my life before I started exploring my gender, that is until I ragequit taking the pill after realizing it was supporting my depression and I hated remembering to take it and freaking out when I may have forgotten.\n\nFast forward to today, I am sitting here dreading the monthly mess after getting a reminder from my tracking app that my period is about to come. My periods are what I would consider normal right now for a vegan, relatively active body with a copper IUD in place in my uterus. But I keep thinking, did I jump on my bike and spin enough times this month to keep it light? Will my period ruin an exciting week of hanging out with my mom and my partner's birthday weekend?

Specifically I mean to bring up my eating disorder: Anorexia Athletica. This disorder is categorized as the lack of caloric intake for the amount of energy one expends on a hourly to daily basis. I feel like I need to hone in my eating disorder and would like to touch more on my practice of Tibetan Buddhism, as well as feel comfortable in my body through healthy exercise routines and hone in my diet which should not consist what I currently put into it, due to allergies and a desire to be a vegetarian.

That being said, I can't differentiate between body dysmorphia and body dysphoria sometimes and I was wondering what you guys do to deal with it, if you have it, and what holistically you may have done to achieve clarity between the two.

i think i wanna be a really femme boy but i'm AFAB! i spend way too much time trying to present as male which is getting both more easy and more difficult as i lose all of that weight i gained in the past 4 years  (60 down and out of the 200 club y'all!) cuz i lost the hips and whatnot but i'm on these weirdass pills that made me gain like two cup sizes and that's when i finally realized that IT'S DYSPHORIA!! 

so i've been spending all of my time trying to either dress male or hyper feminine. swinging between baggy jeans and hoodies to dresses and nail polish and makeup which i never wear. 

i was a tomboy as a kid. and now im wearing dresses but thinking that i am crossdressing. 

and what sucks the most is that all of my efforts to dress male still read feminine, and me in a dress is just what girls do. it's impossible for me to read as male. one of my good friends is transfeminine and she worries about passing which i know is hard but i cant even begin to pass because the goddam patriarchy made male clothes default and being a femme male is impossible. ]

and i think that might be the stem of my frustration. i know that gender is a social construct while dysphoria is real (oh good lord get rid of my nips and hips i don't need money /alwaysunnyreference)

but being read as a tomboy girl is killing me

2,2018-02-01 08:50:14,7uhgcj,14,1,"So! Long story short-- I've been struggling with my gender identity for as long as I can remember and I only recently (last year) starting ID'ing as Genderfluid.

I've always thought maybe I was a transman (I'm AFAB) but stepping into any of those spaces always had me very spooked. I think the idea of fully being ONE gender-- in body and mind-- has always scared me a lot? 

But I think the idea of ""wanting a penis sometimes"" had me convinced that I HAD to be a transman to have those thoughts? Which I know now is NOT the case-- tho ideally I think I would be equipped with both parts? (Hope I'm not the only one...;;)

So talking to other Genderfluid people last year really helped a lot...(cosplay helps too!)
Even just now, roaming thru this sub I bit-- I feel such relief.

My gender has always given me such bad anxieties and I've struggled so much with worse and worse dysphoria as I've gotten older-- I feel so afraid so much of the time like somehow I'm not...gender-fluid-y? enough to ID.

I don't know-- this post got really rambly really fast so I guess I just wanted to express how happy I am to have found this sub!

I also wanted to ask if anyone had any tips for dysphoria? Specifically dysphoria while masturbating/having sex? 

(I struggle feeling incomplete sometimes because it feels like I NEED A PENIS to feel completely whole in my body. Like I'm a puzzle and that's the last piece.)

Does a packer help on particularly boy-ish days? Has anyone used a Feeldoe for a type of simulation?

Hope none of this is TMI. I appreciate everyone's patience with me! Thank you!

24,2018-02-12 19:52:56,7x3gue,3,9,"Hi there everybody! This is my first post on Reddit so I thank you in advance for your time and insight! 

I am long time illustrator, designer, husband and father of three kids in rural Arkansas. I recently made the jump to full time freelance illustration and design. 

A year or two ago, my family and I decided to start a series of books for kids. I am working on the first book now and have some questions for this subreddit's subscribers. (But because I'm nervous about being accused that I'm trying to sell something, I am going to share what will help now and soon I will share the name and where to find out more). One of primary inspirations for the books was to create something for kids that was not gender driven while at the same time, not pandering to non-conforming or questioning kids. Some of that inspiration came from personal experience. I am basically straight with a few exceptions of little consequence, mostly having to do with fingernail polish. But most of it came from wanting to contribute to a world where children like my sons (twins, both under ten and gender non-conforming, one much more so than the other) had something to read that depicted gender fluid characters who were living their good life, was not heavy-handed or lesson driven, was clean, and wasn't even always about them. 

In my limited research I've found stuff out there for questioning kids/teens, transgender kids/teens, et al. But most of what I found was either overly sexualized or pandered and focused too much on *tolerating* differences, avoiding all nuance and story telling craft. All of them missed the opportunity to simply show characters who aren't add odds with themselves and supporting characters who aren't just *mystified* by the gear-head, skirt-wearing self-identified girl. 

So long story short, we got started on the first book. Gender doesn't even come up in it. Readers who are familiar with it's history will know one of the main characters identifies as a girl but ""was born a Larry"". But it does not figure into the story, which has about six other characters, one of which could be assumed by readers to be a lesbian, but again, it doesn't come up. 

Other important subtexts within the overall series is:
* It is set in rural Arkansas and will hopefully resonate quite a bit with anybody who, even begrudgingly, has a connection to southern, ""uneducated"", rural upbringing or lineage.

* It incorporates the natural and unnatural landscape and regional history deeply, but subtly, into the story

* We have an ambitiously wide audience in mind. From 3 to 25 years old. For that reason, and others, sexual expression never comes into the story. I know there is global discussion as to what sexual expression can look like from the youngest and agree that some simple outward expressions of gender can be conceived of as Freudian sexual communications. But that is missing the forrest for the trees. Our stories will not be about dissecting what it *means* to be kid/adult who is exploring gender. They will be about what it could look like to be someone who is exploring gender among peers who affirm by utilizing the same wide range of enthusiasms they'd bestow upon other kids. 

All this is to (finally) get to my request for advice. As a freelancer in great hideout of Arkansas, I don't make a ton of money so most of my free time is spent trying to drum up freelance work. Which cuts deeply into my time to illustrate this project. So, we've started seeking Patreon supporters to help make ends meet. The end goal ideally being that I switch over to full time story telling and illustrating of this project. But I am not a particularly charismatic sales person, nor do I have the time to spend seeking support in any substantial way. Soooo…

**Based on your current limited knowledge of the project, what would inspire *you* personally to consider supporting? I especially want to hear your thoughts if you live in or have close ties to rural southern communities where being a non-binary person of any age can be especially hard. And gender driven media is just about the only option.** 

I'm super excited about working on this project for years to come, so let me know what questions you have! Because this is the internet and people are always being conniving, I'm will share links to images, articles, websites, etc. related to the project once people are engaged or by request. *But rest assured, this is a real and good thing!*

I grew up in a house with a very homophobic father who constantly pushed me to be more ""girly"" and it took me until pretty recently to realize that I've always liked women (as well as men) but closed myself off to that idea because I lived at home. Even now that I live on my own I'm only out and open with select friends and my partner (male) about that. I'm also attracted to nonbinary folks and really anyone? So I don't even know what to label that but since I'm outwardly in a ""hetero"" relationship I don't feel the pressure to be out about anything.

My problem is that as more time has progressed I find that I really like being referred to as a boy. It started a few years ago. When I still lived at home I couldn't dress as masculine as I wanted but I still would manage to encorporate some male clothing into my wardrobe. So much so that when I would go out with female friends that they would refer to me as their ""little boyfriend"". And being called that felt really good. At work, being a small girl and being surrounded by guys, a few of them started referring to me as their brother, or affectionately, ""little brother"". And it felt really really good to hear that and be called that and on days when I dress masculine I love referring to myself as a boy or man. Or being called handsome. I still like to wear feminine clothes sometimes and don't have major problems with my body (some days I do). And I don't mind when anyone uses she/her pronouns-- but I can't tell if it's because I think it would be silly for someone to call me he/him.

Some days I can't describe it, but I just want to be in this body that feels strong and sturdy and dressing it up that way makes me feel so good. Like I'm me, but a different kind of me..??

29,2018-02-15 15:22:52,7xr18v,3,5,"The Scottish Government is currently consulting on proposed changes to Gender Recognition.

The main points are:

* **Self declaration**  
Let trans people get official recognition of their gender without the current requirement of a psychiatric report.
* **16-17 year olds**  
Let trans people apply for gender recognition from 16, the age at which young people in Scotland are deemed to have full legal capacity.
* **Non-binary**  
Let non-binary people have their gender fully legally recognised through self-declaration.

This consultation is **vital** and closes on the 1 March at 17:00 (GMT). If the Scottish Gov gets more negative responses than positive ones it will be extremely difficult for them to justify updating legal gender recognition. If the number of negative responses is large then the rights of trans people are at risk of being rolled back, not only in Scotland but also in the whole of the UK.

**Most unfortunately, the media has been particularly hostile about trans equality in recent weeks and so there is a REAL RISK that this negative media coverage will encourage a larger number of negative responses. So now more than ever we need people to respond to the consultation!**

Not all the questions need to be answered. Even saying something simple like “I support trans rights” already helps. They do ask for a name and e-mail address but these can be kept confidential.

**Background:** Hi, masculine cis male throwaway here. Been hanging out with a trans friend of mine lately, figuring out my sexuality (I've identified as hetero for most of my life, but have come to find I'm A-OK with anyone who is feminine).

Through this friend, I've been introduced to an absolutely lovely, very feminine AMAB genderfluid individual who I'd learned, to my surprise, thought I was cute. We've been texting each other for two days now and we're both down for hanging out more.

I haven't been in a *romantic* relationship before. We cuddled last night and it felt great.

As I understand from what they've told me/my friend told me, their identity/behavior changes depending on social context rather than over time, ie: feeling more feminine in a room of men. AFAIK their preferred appearance doesn't change, but their behavior does.

**Questions so far:**

1. I really like this person so far and want to take their interest and run with it. What can I do/should I keep in mind to avoid fucking this up?

2. Does their fluidity mean that they'd generally be feminine with me? I don't think being masculine sometimes would be a dealbreaker, but I'm unsure of what their masculine state entails.

Please feel free to ask me questions that you think would help.",genderfluid,"Cis(het?)
