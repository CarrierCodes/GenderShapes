3,2018-06-01 15:21:30,8nsou0,0,27,"Random thing I want to share.

It was the Catfish episode of Ari and Jamey that made me accept I was trans/NB.

I'd discovered/been reading about agender and other nonbinary identities. I initially stumbled across it because of the LGBT positive artists I followed on tumblr, from there I actively sought out information.

It was like I was split in 2, or maybe more like a Russian doll inside me. Part of me knew that I felt a personal connection to this. I even had the cringey/ignorant moment of maybe I'm intersex (sorry!) but remembered I'd done one of those online spit-DNA tests so knew I had XX chromosomes.

Then the aforementioned episode of Catfish. I saw it for a second time while a bunch of friends where over. One of them said something along the lines of trapping/tricking him and I *went off* I was *livid.*

Cue me storming off and everyone leaving. My spouse literally found me in the closet freaking out. This had clearly hit a personal note and he wanted to know why. He was very concerned and understanding. I freaked out and long story short told him it was because I was like her, but I'm an ""it"" and no one will be okay with that (internalized transphobia). I had not truly acknowledged it to myself before. I came out to him at the same time I came out to myself.

He was accepting but also at times struggled with it. He seems to have gotten past that though and I think it's been over a year since its been remotely an issue. He uses my proper pronouns and defends me. He went to support group with me. He for a time also considered they/them but ultimately is just gender divergent and went back to he/him. We are stronger for it and I hope one day I can be completely instead of partially out. Lately I've been exploring and accepting that I might need to actually transition more than I'd originally anticipated, baby-steps!

Thanks Ari for being brave enough to share your story on TV and to all the people online who pioneered getting this info out there. Visibility is so important! I didn't even know you could be anything other than a boy or girl! Learning this (and getting over my fear of being NB) has made me happier and more comfortable in my skin.

I had discovered my queerness (non binary) close to a year ago and I've been sitting on it, thinking about whether or not I was going to come out. As time has passed, I've begun to realize how much I'm bothered by wrong pronouns (I prefer they/them), and how I really just want to be proud of who I am, and not hide it and feel ashamed of it. I thought maybe I could hear some coming out stories from all of you to help give me some inspiration/bravery. I have a trans brother and if I know anything, I know its going to be hard to come out to our family. I immediately assume they will all say I'm riding on his coat tails and wanting to be like him (because were twins and I just want to feel closer to him, I have gotten this reaction before from one person Ive come out to) Or that I'm just making shit up. Basically all the usual fears one might face in the coming out process. I've got a wonderful support network in my partner and a few great friends, but I just havent mustered up the courage yet.

The well\-known image that people seem to have of a nonbinary person is an afab teenager with buzzed hair and a jean jacket. This is, for about a year or two, what I thought I needed to be. I spent a lot of time and effort trying to push a look that was androgynous and punk without being actually *out*.

The first time I saw an amab nonbinary person, I thought they looked like sunshine through my computer screen. Their hair was shoulder\-length and their eyeliner was fantastic. I'm an afab person, but I saw this enby and realized suddenly, there's no right way to *be* nonbinary. While this is glorious and made me feel immediately more welcome, I realized that I couldn't do the regular nonbinary look. I had the short hair with shaved sides and the jean jackets for a year, but when I grew my hair out to my shoulders, I found that it was the look that* reall*y validated me. I call it my skater boy haircut.

We have gender roles, even as nonbinary people. Boys are expected to have short hair and sports, girls are expected to have long hair and makeup, and nonbinary people are expected to serve up our most extra and most androgynous looks. Thing is, we don't have a gender to pass as. We're a concept that isn't accepted or really recognized a lot of the time. This realization changed my life. I don't have to pass as anything. I can wear a dress or a suit and it doesn't matter what my body looks like, it doesn't define me. Your body doesn't define you, and you can wear anything that makes you happy.

Clothes and looks have no gender, and they don't define us. Wear makeup if you want, wear bowties if you want, wear anything you want. You are who you are, and nobody and nothing can change that.

I'm a nonbinary person, I get dysphoria, so I want a binder, but I also like the feeling of skirts on my legs, so I'll wear my binder and a skirt. Maybe the next day I'll need a break from binding, and I'll wear a bra and a t\-shirt and jeans, and just go on my way, and I'm still me, I'm still an enby. I wore a dress and heels to Prom, and it was still a nonbinary\-ass person in all the photos. Clothes and gender have become separate to me.

This isn't to say that you shouldn't be trying to look androgynous or have the ""nonbinary look"", if that's what makes you feel good, get it and hold onto that.

My AFAB partner has recently began identifying as non-binary it was something I (also AFAB) wasn't really aware of before. Since they started doing research and watching non-binary and trans videos on YouTube I'm now starting to wonder if I'm not cis. 

I have never been very gender-conforming and was pressured to be feminine growing up. Recently I've begun presenting more masculine in my look  (men's clothes, short hair) and feeling more confident in myself. Occasionally I get gendered as male and it totally makes my day.

The thing that worries me is my partner has a lot of gender dysphoria compared to the minimal amount that I feel.

I'm in a relationship that I've invested a lot in and now believe is becoming fully healthy (and very valuable even if not 100% balanced yet), but it started with two months of my partner lying to me about believing NB exists as a gender instead of admitting she was transmedicalist and was seeing me as a woman.  I asked her Day 1 if she was bisexual because I can only date someone who will like me as bigender.  I said I was going on T soon on the second date.  She ignored all that because it only mattered what she wanted from me and saw me as.  No one should be doubted about their stated gender, and it's ridiculous because I have been out basically my whole life, with family who finds it obvious, and a documented history of my years of being dually male and female.  She mentally edited me into a woman, minimally pretended to care/believe when I explained it to her over and over and over, shamed and guilted me if I said I was uncomfortable/having trouble trusting her/unable to be myself around her, shamed me anytime I acted male, said something maximally dysphoric (you're all curves, no edges, calling me a woman when I kept telling her not to, calling me her girlfriend when I said I wasn't).  She reinforced every female quality and behavior and pointedly ignored anything male, like when you're training an animal.  It was painfully slow to change, like when it was clear I'd leave she tried to say ""handsome"" but said it so inauthentically and jokingly it was worse.  She kept touching my breasts when I asked her not to, said I could fight her off if I'd wanted.  She kept ignoring my stated discomfort with PiV sex, pressured/manipulated me into what I know can tell was sexual behaviors that made me more attractively female in her eyes, no contraception (she's AMAB), made fun of me for being worried about a condom breaking and being distressed by taking Plan B.  I kept making excuses for her (because I'm dysfunctional about deserving mistreatment after narcissistic abuse/codependency from childhood).  Then she tried to persuade me not to start T because she'd worry I wouldn't look as cute, so I knew we had to stop doing this.  I made boundaries and set ultimatums and she came to realize how horrible she had been, fell apart. Over many months she slowly became accountable and improved and started affirming me. 

Now she's been very authentically affirming for months (claiming it was because she got over internalized homophobia that made her resist peace with her androphilic side of bisexuality), has said she knows she was abusive and wants to change, we mostly have sex w me topping now, and she does really seem to see me as bigender/masc of center and is authentically attracted to me for that.

I was born with feminine genitalia, but I am not sure what I am because I feel like nothing. I am okay with she/her/hers pronouns because that is how society sees me.

2015 U.S. Transgender Survey](https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf), and I thought some of the statistics where very interesting and unexpected. Sorry if this has been discussed before.

Chapter 4 (page 47-67) contains the results of one of the largest transgender surveys conducted at the time in the US (27k+ respondents). The survey is very thorough. For the most part the respondents where split into 4 groups: trans woman, trans men, non-binary people and cross dressers. Here are some of the statistics:

&gt;Gender identity: 35% Non-binary, 33% Transwoman, 29% Transmen, 3% Crossdressers

&gt;Pronouns respondents ask people to use: 37% he/his, 37% she/her, 29% they/their, 20% do not ask people to use specific pronouns, 4% no pronouns (only name), 4% other pronouns than the ones listed, 2% ze/hir.

&gt;Sexual orientation non-binary people: 34% queer, 21% pansexual, 17% asexual, 10% bisexual, 8% homosexual, 8% sexual orentation not listed, 2% heterosexual.

&gt;Gender that people who do not know they are non-binary usually assume they are: 58% Non-trans woman, 19% Assumptions vary, 17% Non-trans man, 2% Trans man, 2% Others cannot tell their genders, 1% Trans woman, 1% Non-binary.

&gt;53% Sometimes tell others they are non-binary, 44% usually let others assume they are man or woman, 3% always tell others they are non-binary.

&gt;Main reasons for not telling people they are non-binary: 86% most people do not understand so they don't try to explain it, 82% it is easier not to say anything, 63% most people dismiss it as not being a real identity or a ""phase"", 43% they might face violence, 35% they are not ready to tell people they identify as non-binary, 35% the might lose their job or not able to get a job, 24% they might not get the medical care they need.

I was very surprised at how many people identified as non-binary, seeing how little representation there is here on Reddit (both r/ftm and r/mtf are over 3 times the size, and they also seem to be the majority on subs like /asktransgender). 

In a way I shouldn't really be surprised that 58% of non-binary people are seen as a woman vs 17% men, since its socially acceptable for woman to dress as man but not for man to dress as woman, so when most people see a trace of femininity, they'll automatically think woman. But I was really surprised only 5% thought they where trans and/or non-binary. Personally, this is also the reason I don't like to go outside looking more 'feminine' because I don't like how different people treat me when they think I'm a woman.

The amount of non-binary people that never disclose that they are non-binary and the reasons why weren't very surprising to me, seeing how socially unacceptable it still is, but still made me kind of sad.

Here are some of the statistics:\n\n&gt;Gender identity: 35% Non-binary, 33% Transwoman, 29% Transmen, 3% Crossdressers\n\n&gt;Pronouns respondents ask people to use: 37% he/his, 37% she/her, 29% they/their, 20% do not ask people to use specific pronouns, 4% no pronouns (only name), 4% other pronouns than the ones listed, 2% ze/hir.\n\n&gt;Sexual orientation non-binary people: 34% queer, 21% pansexual, 17% asexual, 10% bisexual, 8% homosexual, 8% sexual orentation not listed, 2% heterosexual.\n\n&gt;Gender that people who do not know they are non-binary usually assume they are: 58% Non-trans woman, 19% Assumptions vary, 17% Non-trans man, 2% Trans man, 2% Others cannot tell their genders, 1% Trans woman, 1% Non-binary.\n\n&gt;53% Sometimes tell others they are non-binary, 44% usually let others assume they are man or woman, 3% always tell others they are non-binary.\n\n&gt;Main reasons for not telling people they are non-binary: 86% most people do not understand so they don\'t try to explain it, 82% it is easier not to say anything, 63% most people dismiss it as not being a real identity or a ""phase"", 43% they might face violence, 35% they are not ready to tell people they identify as non-binary, 35% the might lose their job or not able to get a job, 24% they might not get the medical care they need.\n\nI was very surprised at how many people identified as non-binary, seeing how little representation there is here on Reddit (both r/ftm and r/mtf are over 3 times the size, and they also seem to be the majority on subs like /asktransgender). \n\nIn a way I shouldn\'t really be surprised that 58% of non-binary people are seen as a woman vs 17% men, since its socially acceptable for woman to dress as man but not for man to dress as woman, so when most people see a trace of femininity, they\'ll automatically think woman. But I was really surprised only 5% thought they where trans and/or non-binary. Personally, this is also the reason I don\'t like to go outside looking more \'feminine\' because I don\'t like how different people treat me when they think I\'m a woman.\n\nThe amount of non-binary people that never disclose that they are non-binary and the reasons why weren\'t very surprising to me, seeing how socially unacceptable it still is, but still made me kind of sad.\n\nThoughts?', 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'More non-binary people than I thought', 'created': 1528750310.0}"

110,2018-06-12 17:54:55,8ql2dz,3,12,"Hi all,

After going through this process, I wanted to share my experience and what I learned after getting my top surgery approved through my insurance.

Step 1:
Call your insurance company to see if you have coverage for gender-related procedures, if so - ask to see if you have out-of-network benefits.  If you do, this is great.  This means you have more options when it comes to looking for a therapist (you'll most likely need a letter from them in support of your surgery) as well as locating a surgeon (Dr. Garramone will bill insurance for patients who have out-of-network benefits).  Make sure you understand the fine print of the out-of-network benefits.
Step 1A: If your insurance does not cover gender-related surgeries, you can appeal this!  There are some great resources out on the internet to help you do this, use Google!  

Step 2: Once you know that your insurance will cover such procedures (as they should!) the next thing you want to do is to ask about your deductible and how much it is.  A deductible is something that you need to pay first BEFORE insurance will pay anything.  For example, sometimes it's $500, meaning you need to pay out of pocket $500 before insurance kicks in.  Sometimes people have really high deductibles and in my case it's $2,000.  I'm lucky enough that my employer will cover 90% of that deductible only requiring me to pay $200.  So things like that could happen and you'll want to find out either from parents (if you're using their insurance or your own employer on how that works).  If you're using a government funded plan, you'll want to clarify that information when speaking with the benefits representative. 

Step 3: Find the procedure policy that indicates what documentation you need to get this surgery covered.  Google top surgery and then the name of your insurance.  This should pull up the policy which will tell you how many letters you need, sometimes it's 2, usually it's just 1.  What the letter should say, for example my letter needed to state how long I was living as my preferred gender and needed specific examples of how my gender dysphoria impacts my daily functions.  You can print out this procedure policy and give it your therapist or doctor, whoever is writing your letter.  This will ensure they include this information in your letter. 

Insurance has 30 days to make a decision on whether or not they will approve a surgery or not, however it typically takes them 5-7 business days.  You'll be notified via snail mail of the approval or denial and from there, you'll either be able to schedule your surgery or file an appeal. There are also great resources out there for a constructing an appeal for an insurance denial.

It still doesn't feel real and I was happy that I was able to navigate this crazy system.  I worked as an office manager in a Physical Therapy office for 3 years, so I became very familiar with CPT codes, insurance and benefits.

I pass 100%. I have facial hair and a deep voice - which I want. I use he/him pronouns - which I don't really like, but tolerate. It's my dream to look as male as possible, but still have the world know that I'm not a guy. But I can't seem to take the next step and make this dream a reality.

I feel like, like I've spent all this time trying to be seen as a valid person, to not have my
(perceived) identity questioned, and if I come out as NB/use different pronouns, that'll all be taken away and I'll have to start over. To be completely honest with you all, I don't think I can handle it.

138,2018-06-14 19:46:47,8r4rsb,1,16,"**Hi everyone! Sorry in advance for the long post...i'll try to sum it up with a tl;dr at the end but no promises :)**

I wanted to share what I hope will be a confidence booster for anyone (like myself) who often struggles with not only self\-acceptance but anxiety over shopping in the ladies department dressed as a guy/in guy mode/anything that doesn't scream feminine.

Over the past month or so I've kind of forced myself to take some big steps in this journey of self\-exploration and self\-acceptance. It all kind of started back in early May when I took a big step of faith and made a bridal appointment at David's Bridal ([read about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/genderqueer/comments/8hoqw0/davids_bridal_experience/)). That alone was a huge confidence booster and if you read my linked post, you'll understand why. Since then I've been so much more comfortable in walking into women's stores or the women's department and browsing and trying on clothes, and even being less ""secretive"" that I'm shopping for myself. Most people I've run into don't seem to give me a second glance or even notice there's a guy browsing the racks.

I am still figuring out my identity/expression, but I'm obviously non\-binary, somewhere between genderfluid, genderqueer or gender nonconforming. I know many people will tell me these terms are quite similar but I'm having trouble settling on one. That said, I'm really unable to present feminine in public at all at the moment. I am married, and my wife is not exactly comfortable with the idea of having a husband who is bending the societal gender boundaries, since this was a revelation I made after we were already married.

So, being an obvious guy (6'2"", beard, deep voice), I have always found it quite intimidating wander the ladies sections on my own. After my experience at David's Bridal, I've found it easier and easier to shop for myself by myself. Earlier this week I stopped into my local Lane Bryant shop (having heard they were very LGBT friendly), and quietly asked an employee if I could be fitted for a bra (I thought it would help fill out some of my more feminine tops even though I don't really \*need\* one), and she said ""oh absolutely!"" and took me back to the dressing room and measured me and asked if I was looking for something in particular. She brought me a few options and left me to try them on, checking on me once or twice and once I settled on one she cashed me out and we got talking and I told her I was going out to a party in public in a dress for the first time with friends and she seemed legitimately happy for me, and it was wonderful!! Having bought my bra, I could resist trying on a few dresses and tops while I was there so I picked out a few and after trying them on (to no avail, unfortunately, wrong sizes and I was running late to a work event at this point) she asked me ""how did those dresses work out?"" which was simply thrilling, openly talking to someone about the dresses I tried on and what I liked about them and what not.

Next day I decided to take this boost of confidence and stop in to Torrid (also very LGBT friendly) at my local mall. I browsed for a bit and one of the salesladies asked me if I needed anything so I asked her about some shoes I was looking for and she brought me out a couple pairs in different sizes and let me tell you \- in guy mode, in a ladies store, walking around in four\-inch block heels was an experience, let me tell you!! I had already picked out a few dresses to try on, but being in guy mode I didn't have a bra on, so I marched my confident self over to the bra racks, found one in my size, and confidently asked for a dressing room. Again, tried on several outfits and on the way out the very friendly saleslady asked how it went, not seeming to bat an eyelash that this 6'2"" guy just came out of a dressing room after trying on dresses and heels. It was SO AFFIRMING to not feel like a freak! 

I will be in San Diego in July for a few days and have more or less decided I'm going get myself all dolled up and head to one (or several) of the hopping gay bars in Hillcrest and have a few drinks and hopefully dance the night away!! PS if any of you lovlies happen to be in town mid\-July hit me up and if we can get together I'd love to meet some Reddit friends in SoCal!!

**tl:dr \- if you're worried or anxious about shopping in the women's department in guy mode, don't be! In my experience, (most) salespeople don't care who buys their clothes, and most other customers won't even give you a second glance. Granted some areas of the country are safer for this than others, and please don't risk your safety for a dress or pair of shoes, no matter how cute they are it's not worth it!**

Please, call me Jay.

I'm a college student, a psychology major. I transferred to my university after 2 long ass years at community college. The community I grew up in, and spent near 21 years in, is very much conservative and religious. I'd never met anyone who wasn't straight or not strictly born male or female. Sure, they were and are there, but I only saw them from a distance, and they never stuck around for long. After coming out, they never returned the following school year. They were all demonized by the church or ostracized by the school. Anyway, after I transferred I made some friends my first semester, all of them in the marching band. We never really hung out after season was over though. So I decided to rush a sorority that's associated with the school of music. 

That second semester is what I like to call both the self discovery semester and the beginning of my depression year. Long story short, my Big is gay af, and one of the most amazing humans I've ever met. In fact, a good 3/4 of the sorority is either not straight, not binary, or both. My little homophobic/transphobic ass went for a spin. I learned and I grew. I got really overwhelmed with social things and subsequently came out of some of my social anxiety. I also got overwhelmed with school work and learned the hard way that my major at the time, education, wasn't for me. Start the depression year. It was also the semester I said 'fuck it', and changed my major to psychology. I told no one. Literally walked into the psych building, filled out the papers, and took them straight to the dean's office. I told no one until a couple weeks later when I got a tentative acceptance to the major, dependent on me passing a summer class.

The beginning of my 2nd year at university, it was a time. I finally got to see the inner workings of my sorority, and all of the drama within it. I still love them anyway. I was bullied in marching band for having panic attacks during auditions. I finished the pre-reqs for my major. 

In August I discovered that I am asexual. I came out to my best friend in September. 

In November I discovered my attraction to women, in addition to men. So I came out as biromantic. 

Biromantic asexual.

It wasn't until this past semester, maybe around February, that I started feeling something different. I wasn't quite sure what it was. Due to the environment of where I grew up, I was never allowed to explore anything regarding myself. Basically a carbon copy of my parents. But after almost 2 years of living in a college town, I felt something. Something that I needed to explore. At first I thought I might be a trans male, but it didn't fit. 

The feeling comes and goes, and it varies in strength. Sometimes I feel a little feminine, though rarely. Sometimes I feel masculine, though not entirely. I often feel in between, kind of neither. I think I lean more toward masculine and that somewhere in between, rarely going to feminine. I don't know if it's really something I feel within me, or if it's a part of me rejecting how and where I was raised, forced into the feminine role and stereotype. 

There are some aspects of femininity I'm not sure I want to give up. But there are so many things I don't want to be a part of. I feel more comfortable in more masculine things. Today especially, being in a clothing store and longing to buy 'men's' jeans, boxers, and suits. I know that clothing doesn't have gender, but it's like a longing to look like them. To be lean and fit with boyish long hair. To be able to pull off a suit like that. Something my really af female body can't do, at least it the way I want it too.

I don't like my female body or my female name. I want a masculine or androgynous body with a masculine name. But I'm afraid. Sometimes I feel like I desperately want to transition to male. Sometimes I feel comfortable enough just downplaying my more feminine features. Sometimes I want to cut my long ass hair into that boyish cut, but I'm terrified I'll instantly regret it and have to live with it. I'm afraid to tell my friends, even though I know they'd be totally accepting. The only time I can admit it to myself is when I've had at least half a bottle of wine. So take this as my testament. 

I don't know wtf I am. I want to explore, but I'm terrafrickingfied. I've just gained acceptance into my friend group, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I have no idea who I am or who I want to be. Sometimes I want to be the person I've grown to be, even with the name and baggage that comes with what I was assigned. Sometimes I want to go for it, be Jason, be him, a part of me.

155,2018-06-16 11:47:29,8riv0l,17,15,"Hello, I’m posting on here for the first time (apart from my introduction post) as I’m interested in finding out if anyone is, or was, in a similar situation to me or might have any advice.

I’ve had gender dysphoria to varying degrees since I was a teenager, dealing with it in various ways such as choosing a male name, wearing  men’s clothes (or masculine clothes designed for women), having short hair, etc. I’ve had other mental problems such as OCD, anxiety and depression, which I’ve treated with anti-depressants (I’ve been off them for 10 years now though), CBT and psychoanalytical therapy. A couple of years ago I registered with a gender clinic and have now been prescribed a low dose of testosterone gel, after about a year of counselling with them. 

I don't have such intense body dysphoria as I used to, because I've come to terms with my anatomy as being just ""my body"" rather than a ""woman's body"". But I’d love to not be seen as a woman in society. I would prefer to be read as male more frequently by the general public. When I look at myself, I think I look fairly masculine, but it seems others don’t always read me that way and that gets me down sometimes. So that’s why I’m considering HRT. 

However I am also a bit worried about starting HRT. I think my tendency towards anxiety and obsessive thoughts are making the situation worse. I would really love to be able to pass as male, or at least look more ambiguous so people don’t instantly gender me as female, without having to risk the side effects of T. I don’t want all of them and I know you can’t tell which ones will happen unless you try it. So it feels like a bit of a gamble to me. The clinic haven't been that helpful in terms of guidance, pretty much just saying it's up to me! It's also hard to get frequent appointments with them due to severe short-staffing, so I don't feel very supported.

The main things I want are to have a more masculine face and body shape, and a lower voice. I can already grow a fair bit of facial hair naturally - not as much as a cis male but I have to shave every day to look clean-cut! But I don’t especially want a beard. I’d like to feel better in myself too, less anxious, and I've heard some people online and in real life say that T has done that for them. Although I guess that’s very subjective and personal.

Possible side effects I’m worried about: acne (I am prone to it even pre-T), head hair loss, possibly gaining fat, and maybe not liking genital changes that might happen. 

I have connected with a voice coach, who at our first meeting said I should be able to get into an androgynous or even male range without T! And I’m getting that on the NHS (I’m in the UK) so it’ll be free. So that’s one glimmer of hope for me at the moment. 

So as things stand now, I have the gel, I’ve tried a bit of it to see how it feels to apply it, and that’s about as far as I’ve got! For me, the question is not “am I transgender?” but rather, “what should I do about it?” I know some people socially transition before starting hormones, but I don’t really know where to start with that, beyond what I’ve already done in terms of my presentation. I’m quite a reserved person IRL, so to announce to people that they should see me as a man now feels difficult for me.

Greygender is a thing I very recently discovered and I'm trying to figure out if it fits me or not.

I've always been more of a ""tomboy"" girl growing up right? Like I've always been comfortable with she/her pronouns but I don't feel particularly feminine most of the time.

I don't really understand the concept of certain things or activities being tied to one gender or the other.

Some days I enjoy being more feminine, some days more masculine. I often feel uncomfortable in public dressing more masculine but I come from a small town and I'm afraid of the judgement.

Overall though, I just don't think I feel that my gender is something I have strong feelings towards but it's kind of hard to tell. Since I've never felt any other way maybe it's just the norm for everyone? 

I'm afraid to call myself greygender and end up changing my mind later or something. But I would love to have a word to use to describe myself other than ""tomboy"" because that's outdated and childish.

So I had a question about haircuts. I'm AFAB and I wish to look more androgynous but I also wish to save out for a bob or longer.

So far I felt that I looked the most androgynous was when I had a bit longer hair on top but an undercut. So I'm kinda worried I'll look too feminine with a bob. Any suggestions how to balance it? 

I tend to vary the way I dress from very masculine, neutral and very feminine. I just want a look where I truly feel like myself with the hair and face.

Thanks for reading! 💕

I am also bi/pan and when I was younger assumed that this less-masculine leaning nature was connected to my sexuality (now totally aware that is not true).

But of late I've been doing a lot more soul-searching on this topic and have begun to realize that I in fact belong in the androgynous/non-binary category.   Although I was already leaning towards this assumption, I decided to see if the internet, in all it's infinite and terrifying glory, had any sorts of ""tests"" available that could shed light on my gender identity in a relatively objective manner.   I found several, ranging from silly, buzz-feed style ""What Hogwarts House do you belong in?"" to what appear to be more serious psychological evaluations.  

So my question is:  At least for the more ""serious"" gender identity evaluations out there, do you think there is merit to such tests?   Has anyone else taken these and were you surprised/skeptical/offended by the results or questions?   I found some of the questions to be a bit odd, many seemed to suggest that one binary gender or the other was better at different intellectual subjects (i.e language arts versus math), and several just pertained to stereotypical gender-role interests (power tools and cars for men, clothing and sewing for women).   I was identified as androgynous or non-binary in all that I took, though many of the questions were very similar across tests, and I wonder if it wasn't just my pre-existing assumptions that influenced these results.  As someone trained in a ""hard"" science I tend to take psychology with a grain of salt.   I'm not saying it isn't a valid and useful line of research, just that every field of study has it's limitations and potential biases.   Anyway, thoughts, opinions on these tests?

So many kids are still being raised with no idea that there's anything beyond the binary. And there's parents out there who really want to support their kids without pushing gender on them, but they need help and resources. So really, everyone needs non-binary stories!

So, here's what I need help with!

I'm looking for books, videos, and other media that helps kids and care givers learn about non-binary identities, experiences, and stories. And I'm looking for other lists and online libraries that others have already assembled!

Here's some more specifics:

🌼 I'm mostly looking for media about being non-binary, genderqueer, trans, and gender non-conforming. I'm also interested in media that helps explore issues related to non-binary experience, like women's liberation, queer liberation, patriarchy, etc. I'm definitely especially interested in media that centers non-binary experiences and perspective tho. 
🌼 I'm also looking for media that features non-binary characters w/o necessarily being about being non-binary, especially picture books for younger kids. More media that simply used they/them pronouns would be amaaaazzzzing.
🌼 I want both fiction and non-fiction!
🌼 K thru 5 is my age focus right now, but I'll probably expand that soon so send me resources for older kids too!

I have a very small collection of printed zines and comics, plus 20ish videos I've bookmarked on youtube. I'll assemble them all soon and share!

I'm also interested in media that helps explore issues related to non-binary experience, like women's liberation, queer liberation, patriarchy, etc. I'm definitely especially interested in media that centers non-binary experiences and perspective tho. \n🌼 I'm also looking for media that features non-binary characters w/o necessarily being about being non-binary, especially picture books for younger kids. More media that simply used they/them pronouns would be amaaaazzzzing.\n🌼 I want both fiction and non-fiction!\n🌼 K thru 5 is my age focus right now, but I'll probably expand that soon so send me resources for older kids too!\n\nI have a very small collection of printed zines and comics, plus 20ish videos I've bookmarked on youtube. I'll assemble them all soon and share!\n\nthank you all!!"", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'kids need non-binary stories!', 'created': 1529386305.0}"

Although I am in a heterosexual marriage, my first sexual experience was with a woman, and I consider myself bisexual. My husband knows this and supports my desire for a relationship with a female at some point. 

So when we stop taking in terms of binary gender, things get more complicated. I have wished, all my life, that I was a “boy”. I can’t say I FEEL like a male, but I don’t really feel female either. I don’t like female clothing, I don’t participate in traditionally female activities, and my husband and I have very much reversed roles: I work and support him, he stays home. 

I love sports and business, I’m highly educated, I love male/androgynous clothing (although my body is very feminine, which makes this difficult), and I wish I didn’t “have to” wear makeup and jewelry and typical girly stuff. On any given day, I will choose the more “masculine” activity or thing over the “feminine” activity or thing. 

My husband has listened to COUNTLESS rants about “if I weren’t a woman, I could...” or “if only I was a dude...” or “just because I don’t have a penis?!” 

As a kid I was a “tomboy”. As a teenager, I was “one of the guys”. Now, I just feel misplaced. I want to smoke cigars and drink whiskey and talk about interesting important things, but the women I am exposed to expect me to want to drink rosé and talk about raising kids (or rather what is wrong with me for not wanting to raise kids). 

I feel that this is more than “being like a guy”-I don’t want to change my physicality, but I do want people to stop boxing me in and assuming I can’t/won’t/shouldn’t do things because of my genitalia.

The plan was to start transitioning (MTF) and once HRT had started doing it's thing, follow up socially.

I thought after I started HRT I would lean into the transition and the compulsion to present female would grow. I was prepared to have my follow up doctor's appointment and ask to crank up the hormones because I had decided that was my path after years of deliberation. I was going to do this.

Since starting though, it went away. I don't experience dysphoria. It's not important to me to transition to female socially anymore and frankly I would rather not deal with breast growth if I can avoid it. The other body changes I'm perfectly fine with.

I don't want to stop HRT, because for the first time I'm content. I'm not distracted from feelings of, I don't know how to describe it. I wouldn't say dysphoria, but I wasn't happy being a guy. It never really felt right.

I present fairly male with some effeminate touches, which didn't feel like enough before. I wanted to present completely female. Now I'm perfectly happy embracing an androgynous look. Less frustrated wearing masculine clothing, less scared to have feminine things that would make someone stop and look.

I don't know anyone that's non-binary and has identified as that for an extended period of time. I'm known people who have at one time thought they were but it was during a time they were still figuring themselves out and have since landed on being fully MTF.

Has anyone else had that reaction to HRT? Is there anyone that's non-binary that came to the conclusion through HRT? I've just spent so many years trying to find where I fit in the world, and after so much time settled on transgender, and to find I'm actually content without going all the way.

TL:DR; I thought I was transgender, but since starting HRT I think I may be non-binary but don't have much reference. Is this normal? What flag should I be hanging in my window?

I'm living in Los Angeles this summer, but I was born and raised in Ohio. I attended the Saturday night of Los Angeles Pride, the night it reached capacity. Immediately I was gendered and assumed to be a lesbian by my lyft driver who was a lesbian. She assumed all the girls I was in the car with were also gay women. Two of the girls are bi and the other was an ally. None of them know I am non-binary, but all were very polite about not pushing me to answer any questions. I don't know them that well as we are just all here on the same summer program and hadn't met until a month ago. Our lyft driver then said some transphobic things and it made me and everyone else so uncomfortable. It was a weird car ride. 

When we arrived we met up with a man from our program. His face was painted rainbow and he was so excited for pride. After telling the story about our lyft driver to him, I explained I lied to her about being gay so it'd be less uncomfortable and easier to get through. He then asked ""well what are you then?"" Even after explaining I wasn't up to discussing it he pressed me 3 different times the rest of the night. I didn't understand why it was so important. 

I'm extremely femme presenting (AFAB ) and I wish I could appear more androgynous just for other people's sake of understanding but I am comfortable in my femininity. My physicality is extremely feminine and I love it, but I shaved my head recently and I'm just always assumed to be a shaved head lesbian girl. 

At pride I just felt so dominated by gay men. I don't want to take anything away from them, but I just was disappointed with the space. I didn't feel free there. I thought it may have been because I was there with acquaintances but I felt all the MCs only ever hyped up gay men. Gay women were talked about even less and I think I only heard something about gender nonconforming people once, and it seemed like an after thought. 

I guess I should've learned more about the festival itself before attending. I thought the booths would have more community driven stations, which were there but not in the way i thought. Everyone just wanted to get drunk it seemed. I don't drink much and hate being high in public spaces... it was a huge party I felt like I shouldn't have been invited to. I looked enough like I should be there but still felt people were making the wrong assumptions.

I'm not 'out' as NB at work but I've been wearing my nails painted to work for several months now. I started painting them maybe a month after I started when I realized that no one knew anything about me and I had an opportunity to pretend I did it all the time. At first, I got a few glances, but no one really said anything (except for one amazing woman) until the office Christmas party, where everyone had been drinking. That's when all of the women were finding excuses to come tell me how much they loved my nails. It was a really great experience because I learned that just because no one is saying anything doesn't mean they disapprove. Since then I've started adding jewelry to my outfits and often get swept up in conversations with women where we talk about each others jewelry and maintenance etc.

A couple of weeks ago I started seeing a therapist to help me navigate the external transition I hope to make, and they mentioned something about the rules we make for ourselves that make it difficult to be ourselves. It's nothing I haven't heard, but in that moment it really struck a chord. I realized I don't want to live a life controlled by fear of rejection or retribution. I also realized that I'm doing exactly that. It's not actual retribution that's stopping me. It's fear. Just fear.

I went to grab a couple of drinks with that amazing woman I mentioned earlier and opened up to her about my identity and we connected and everything was great. This morning when I woke up, I was struggling to decide what top to wear. I grabbed a tight-ish shirt. I grabbed a pink shirt. I looked at some more of my  masculine cut t-shirts and felt frustrated. Suddenly, I realized I was struggling because I really wanted to wear something more feminine, and none of the masculine clothes I typically lean on to achieve that were working for me today. So I grabbed the blouse I bought a few weeks ago, ironed it, drew on some really simple cat eyes and left. No pre-meditation. Today was just the fucking day. I hope the day I walk out the door in a dress is right around the corner :)

Before I started seeing this  therapist, I was really concerned about how to go about telling my coworkers that I'm non-binary and how to tell them to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I figured after I told them, I could start presenting myself however I see fit. I still intend to tell them, but I realized I don't need to tell them, or anyone about my identity to start expressing myself in a non-binary way.

Just fear.\n\nI went to grab a couple of drinks with that amazing woman I mentioned earlier and opened up to her about my identity and we connected and everything was great. This morning when I woke up, I was struggling to decide what top to wear. I grabbed a tight-ish shirt. I grabbed a pink shirt. I looked at some more of my  masculine cut t-shirts and felt frustrated. Suddenly, I realized I was struggling because I really wanted to wear something more feminine, and none of the masculine clothes I typically lean on to achieve that were working for me today. So I grabbed the blouse I bought a few weeks ago, ironed it, drew on some really simple cat eyes and left. No pre-meditation. Today was just the fucking day. I hope the day I walk out the door in a dress is right around the corner :)\n\nBefore I started seeing this  therapist, I was really concerned about how to go about telling my coworkers that I'm non-binary and how to tell them to use they/them pronouns when referring to me. I figured after I told them, I could start presenting myself however I see fit. I still intend to tell them, but I realized I don't need to tell them, or anyone about my identity to start expressing myself in a non-binary way.\n\nIt doesn't matter what they call me today.\n\nI am my fucking self."", 'subreddit': 'NonBinary', 'title': 'I dressed a little more non-binary to work today!', 'created': 1529569688.0}"

Problems is, she (and my dad, and most my other family members too ) are a *lot* more bigoted than she seems to think. my mum is especially bad since she’s often talking about it and saying a lot of transphobic things that stem from the nature of her field of study.

My parents know that I’m some sort of queer, but they seem to think I’m a cis lesbian. I’ve been aware about my sexuality for around 10+ years now, and my gender for almost 6 years, so it’s not like I’m a baby gay/baby trans. I’ve had lots of time to think it over and I’m confident about it. I’m a pretty reserved/closed-off person by nature, but I have no actual problems with people knowing I’m queer. I just tend to keep to myself more often than not, which is why I haven’t actually told them yet.

I’ve been really considering coming out to them the last few years, but I’m nervous that they’ll think that I’m just riding the new “trend” of being queer, when I’ve actually identified as such since before it became a big thing. I’m nervous that they’ll dismiss me for one reason or another. They’ve been saying so many things that make me sure that they would disagree with me, or treat me weirdly somehow.

Also, does anyone know of any good articles, interviews, essays, books, art, or music from nonbinary femme amab people, or similar? Thank you so much. &lt;3

I figured I'd share more details of my experience below if anyone is interested. Many times I've been soothed by just reading what someone else is going through.

\---

Most times I feel like I don't exist and my life isn't real.

I'm constantly trying to stay afloat in this liminal space and have created and adapted so many coping mechanisms to validate my experience. Every day is terrifying, it feels like there's no way in or out of my gender experience, so I float around trying to accept whatever arises. I am so happy for cis men and women who wake up and go about their day not giving the validity of their gender much thought. It is all-consuming for me at this point in my life. I know my happiest days are when I don't give what I do or who I am a second thought - I just be me. Usually that is only possible alone, inside, away from projections, scrutiny, and physical danger. 

I feel *so* damn femme, and I am not trying to / can't afford to pass as a woman, which mostly means when I am brave enough to express my gender in public I'm read as an effeminate gay guy or a straight guy ""very confident in his masculinity"" (the lengths patriarchy will go to keep people corralled in the man-zone -\_\_\_\_- ) ...

I crave permission to simply be myself. Well meaning people say ""just"" be yourself and suggest I forget labels. Wow. It sounds heavenly.

When I try that, I open myself up to critique, judgement, and emotional and physical violence. It has happened.  I have endured traumatic punishments for being myself. I have had enough conversations with ""devil's advocates"" to navigate hell as if it were my hometown. When I just be me, English falls short. My being is not compatible with cis or trans gender templates. I'm elsewhere, and it's scary, to me and to people who see me. We grapple with understanding. Do I deserve to be me? Deserve to be treated like a human? Or am I an ""it""? An other?  By being me, I am always explaining myself to myself and people who see me.

Being conscious of how I feel, how I act on those feelings, and how I'm perceived is so, so exhausting. I look like a man no matter what I do, and I don't pledge allegiance or feel in harmony with anything man-related, whatever that means. I'm an easy target for violence and exploitation because it appears I can't even ""play my role"". I am seen as weak, disposable, laughable...But what courage it takes to accept myself as nature made me despite all of this bullshit? How integral and important am I simply because I'm here - especially because I'm Trying? To live my life honestly, completely. And how serious this is when every day is a grand effort to convince myself I belong on Earth? I'm here, damn it!

Sōtō Zen Buddhism and my daily sitting practice has helped enormously. Sometimes my breath is my only refuge. When I sit, I feel included in all that is. Sometimes, I even feel deep peace, experiencing life beyond illusory gender and other markers of identity. Off the cushion, though, I have a hard time reconciling the development of my authentic, ordinary self that balances my spiritual, extraordinary no-self. I have only recently given myself permission to explore this.

Not passing as a man or a woman is so challenging. I could give a shit about passing insofar as it means safety to me. I am lucky and grateful to have a few friends who accept me as I am. Though, none of my friends are nonbinary, and I only hear about nonbinary femme amab people who have moved on to try to pass as a woman because this is all so heavy. I know of a few nonbinary afab people and my heart is rooting for all of them. I am so thankful for the nonbinary afab people who have recognized that there are not many nonbinary amab people speaking about their experiences, because they inspired me to share this. 

Perhaps I have been looking in the wrong places, which brings me here. 

Where are we? Please, I need to know. 

Thanks so much for reading.

This means I don’t identify within the binary male/female definitions of gender, but something outside that. Along with that, I don’t feel comfortable using male pronouns for myself (he/him/his/himself), but prefer to use they/them/their/themself. I know this may seem confusing and unfamiliar, but I have some resources to help you understand. Please read through all of this letter and look at the articles and resources I’ve provided for you before talking to me about this.

     As I said, I identify as nonbinary. Although this might seem new or unusual, it is an established and valid gender identity. There is a long history, across many different cultures, of more than two distinct gender identities. The term nonbinary falls under the umbrella of Transgender, as I do not identify with the gender assigned to me at birth. Nonbinary is itself an umbrella term that encompasses many distinct gender identities, but all are outside or between the male/female binary. I understand that using they/them pronouns for me may be confusing at first, but it is commonly used for individual people and has a history of prominent usage dating through centuries of English language and literature. A frequent response to asking for use of they/them pronouns is that it is exclusively for groups of people and not individuals, but they/them is used regularly in everyday language for people whose gender identity is unknown. If someone lets you know you missed a phone call you might respond “What did they say?”, if you found a coat on your bed after a party you might ask “Did someone forget their jacket?” and so on. Along with these pronouns, I would appreciate if you would use gender neutral terms for me whenever applicable, such as “child” or “our oldest” instead of “son”, “parent” instead of “father”, “spouse” or “partner” instead of “husband”, “sibling” instead of “brother” and so on. If you’re unsure about what terms to use, you can ask me and I am happy to help.

    I know this all may sound scary and uncertain and that’s completely normal. I have my own fears and anxieties surrounding being open about my gender identity, but I ultimately feel it’s a positive and necessary step and would appreciate your utmost support in this. Adjusting to talking to and about me in gender neutral terms may take some time and effort, but it would make me much more comfortable if you could try to do so. I know this is a lot to take in and there can be many strong emotions involved, which is why I have included some resources to give you more information, as well as to direct you to support groups in your area for parents and family of gender variant people. All of which I think could be helpful to you. If after exploring these you still have questions for me or need more resources, I can help with that. I have already discussed all of this with \[spouse\] and she has told me she’s willing and available to discuss it with you as well. 

     I hope you understand that I still love you both and this doesn’t change our relationship. I still love \[spouse\], \[child 1\] and \[child 2\]. Our marriage and family are intact and she is giving me her full understanding and support. My gender identity does not change anything about who I am, apart from the pronouns and terms used to describe me and talk about me. In being honest and open about my gender identity, I’m not changing anything about who I am, but only trying to be myself more authentically in all my relationships. I will try to be as patient and calm as possible when answering any questions you may have, but there are some things that don’t need to be asked. What clothes I choose to wear or how I present my body is an expression of fashion and personal taste and not an indication of my gender. When exploring resources about nonbinary people and identities, you may find a lot of personal accounts of individuals pursuing many different types of gender expression and physical/medical transitions, all of which are valid, but may not apply to me personally. There are many people who identify as Transgender and nonbinary, not all of which fit in the “born in the wrong body” narrative. Personally, I don’t know at this time what transitioning will look like for me and it might change over time. While I would love and appreciate your support, I also ask that you please respect my privacy in this regard. You are free to disclose and discuss my gender identity with others, but I ask that you would do so with the same respect and sense of personal privacy you always have, as your child and an individual and not in terms of my body parts.

    Thank you for reading all of this. I’ve included links to several articles and resources for you. As I said before, please read through all of this letter and the provided resources, before talking to me about this. 

Love,

I thought I would post it, get some feedback and it might be useful to other people. I used a form letter I found on a nb tumblr as a starting reference. I'm 39, live across the country from my parents and have not lived with them for 20 years. I did however work with them and my brother for more than a decade and saw them regularly (if not daily), until about 18 months ago when my wife and I moved our family. My relationship with them is complicated and I'm not sure I'd even have one, if not for my wife and kids. I still feel like I need to come out to them before I really come out openly in public. I plan on mailing them a letter with a flash drive full of articles and local support group info for them.

And today it just popped up \- a name i haven't seen or heard a lot, nothing comes to my mind when saying it, and also it's unisex and starting with the first letter of my choice.

One thing we ask when picking up any device is that you have a photo ID that is government issued with you in order for us to identify that the phone is yours. I was slightly worried that the ID she would provide may not match her name and identity, if it didn’t then we couldn’t release the phone to her. So, I’d asked if the name she’d given us matched the name on her ID which I usually do for customers that have not given us a name or are under an alias. She unfortunately was upset that I’d asked this and told me she was trans, which I knew, I explained to her that I didn’t want her to feel as if we were asking her to use an old name and therefore an old identity so I wanted to put the name on her ID in the footnotes of her authorisation form so that whilst the whole repair would be under her name, there would be a conformation that the name on the ID is an old name that is now incorrect.
After the appointment she still seemed disappointed and therefore I wanted to ask if there’s any other better way I could’ve approached this, our policies are incredibility strict due to privacy so we can’t bend rules, and I wanted to do the best I can with the limitations in place to make everyone feel accepted and valid, especially in a place like Apple.
I also wanted to put together some training for my team for customers that have IDs that no longer represent their identity, this isn’t necessarily for just transgendered people but also for name changes, marriages ect.

She unfortunately was upset that I’d asked this and told me she was trans, which I knew, I explained to her that I didn’t want her to feel as if we were asking her to use an old name and therefore an old identity so I wanted to put the name on her ID in the footnotes of her authorisation form so that whilst the whole repair would be under her name, there would be a conformation that the name on the ID is an old name that is now incorrect.\nAfter the appointment she still seemed disappointed and therefore I wanted to ask if there’s any other better way I could’ve approached this, our policies are incredibility strict due to privacy so we can’t bend rules, and I wanted to do the best I can with the limitations in place to make everyone feel accepted and valid, especially in a place like Apple.\nI also wanted to put together some training for my team for customers that have IDs that no longer represent their identity, this isn’t necessarily for just transgendered people but also for name changes, marriages ect. So I’d really love to hear any ideas anyone has and any feedback for me, even if it’s constructive, it would really help ☺️', 'subreddit': 'trans', 'title': 'Training help?', 'created': 1528077397.0}"

I am Daric.  
I am male.  
I am your son.  
I am your brother.  
I am your nephew.  
I am your friend.  
I am Transgender.  


I was born Thursday, April 16, 1987. A happy, healthy baby with a head full of black hair.   
The doctor handed me to my mother and said “It's a Girl.” But he was wrong.  
I grew up being told “You are a girl.” But they were wrong.  
I grew up trying to fit into the box I was told I belonged in. I new something was wrong. I didn't feel right doing “girl” things, wearing “girl” cloths.  
I conformed to what was wanted of me, what was expected of me.  
I did my school work, made friends, lived my life... all a lie.  
Years later I finally “woke” up! I knew what was “wrong”. I am a boy! Everything felt “right”. I started going by male pronouns and wearing what I had always liked wearing but was told it wasn't “lady like” and now I could wear because I was a boy. I changed my name... a few times, till I found the one that was right. I felt happier than I ever had.   
I talked to Dr.s and told them what I felt, I went and talked to them for years. Finally I was able to start hormones to change my body to the appearance I felt inside. I started growing body hair and my voice started to deepen. I started passing as male without a second look. The moment you walk up to a stranger at a fast food place and they say “How may I help you, Sir?” Sir! It felt amazing being seen for who I am.  
It's not been easy at all. Life is a struggle every day being who I am. But I wouldn't change a thing! Being miss gendered at birth made me the strong man I am today. My parents raised me the way they felt that they should and I love them for that. I do not hate my parents for calling me their “Daughter”. I was their daughter but now I am their Son. It's a hard change for them to make.   
My parents taught me to respect others. I have a great respect for woman and men. We all have struggles, everyone is different and unique! We are all human! We all love and hate. But let's Love more than we hate! Let's love our Fathers, Mothers, Brothers, Sisters and Friends! Accept them for who they are, humans.

23,2018-06-04 01:30:15,8odgmi,7,6,"My views on gender have become a little muddled in my brain, so I’d like to pick yours to try and sort everything out. 

I believe that gender is a social construct and doesn’t actually exist. Like, it’s all fake and there’s no such thing as “feminine” or “masculine.” Objects and behaviors only hold those labels because we ascribe them to them. 

But I also believe that transgender and gender non-conforming/non-binary people’s experiences are incredibly valid and true. There is no laundry list of things that make you trans, like you are if you say you are! And our gender identity has nothing to do with our “masculine” or “feminine” traits.

So with all of that in mind, how can I believe that gender is fake while also believing that transgender people are real and that I myself am trans? I don’t identify as male whatsoever, but when I say that gender is fake then why does it matter what I identify as as long as I present myself in the way that reflects my true self?

I’ve got myself all in a tizzy over this and have no idea what to think. Honestly it’s making my coming out that much harder because I don’t even know what to say to people.

33/masculine male/just out of a dead end relationship

At 24 I met a girl just in a regular bar, extremely attractive, petite, well spoken etc. We hit it off and on the third real date she disclosed she was mtf...I had no idea what that meant, and not even the slightest clue that she was. I asked questions she explained, told her I was still onboard and really had no idea until she said so. In our time together she met friends, family, and no one suspected or questioned otherwise. Didn't have to adjust or hide anything other than her turning down swim/beach invites with my friends.

We went back and forth on what I guess you would call the dominant role in the bedroom, if you know what I mean. She wasn't shy with it either and expected anything she did to me I would do to her, and although hesitant at first something about being dominated in that fashion by a beautiful girl was extremely erotic, as well as the obvious what I know now is p-spot stimulation. But I enjoyed being the dominant one just as much.

We were together for about 8 months and then one day she broke the news that she had been going through alot personally and job wise and decided she wanted to move to a more ""tolerant"" area. Being in the conservative south - Louisiana, I understood but finishing school and a good job of my own I could not leave.

I often think about her, the things we did. It was just a happenstance meeting that led to it and every relationship since has been typical male female. The experience stuck with me and over the years brought up strap on use with partners, not sure if it's the being dominated aspect, or if subconsciously trying to recreate. But lately I think about it more and more, I have tried to look on dating sites etc, but no such luck other than ""professionals"" that really aren't exactly what I'm looking for. I have accompanied a female friend to a local LGBT bar to scope out and not really anything in the realm of what I'm looking for.

So I guess to get to it, where in Louisiana, specifically Baton Rouge would one find a passable trans for a relationship? Maybe its the way the internet narrows the pool, but I have looked through the subs here and see so many attractive goddesses here but in real life its like finding a needle in a needle stack. Is the issue that I am desiring something so passable that I am just assuming they are when I see them, or is it what I really think, that in Baton Rouge/Louisiana there just aren't really any here.

I did see a girl on POF and wanted to message so bad but there's a severe age difference as she is 20. Other than that I'm lost. And I also severely apologize if any terms or phrases I used were insensitive or incorrect, there's a lot of terminology that goes with this and I really don't understand most of it.

66,2018-06-08 12:30:59,8pjhwa,1,5,"I think I have always been trans at one point and I do not know what to do.

This could be long and messy as I express myself.

When I was young, I always hated masculine activities.  I always wanted to play dolls and do girly things.  I had a phase where I would secretly put on dresses and have had secretly wished that I was born a girl.

My parents caught me and shamed me hard, eventually I became repulsed by these thoughts.

I slowly got a group of male friends and stated to be normal.  But never really connected well with them.

I was normal til about the age 16, where I became sick and became diagnosed with scizoaffective disorder after asking a girl out...and I do not why.  I only had a small crush on her and didn't care if she would reject me or not, but talking to her made something snap in me.  

I was a mess for about eight years

Then I stopped taking the medication by mistaking and was miraculously cured.  Later told I never had scizoaffective disorder in the first place.

In two years, I recovered and started being ""functional"" again.  I didn't really enjoy any of the activities I liked before, I only did them to fit in.  (Although I still cannot hold any job, it is incredibly difficult for me to give or trust anymore even for small things.)

But then I got a girlfriend.  And I felt different then I expected.  I felt envious, I think?  

We go to the mall and I litterally throw clothes for her to try on, but is that because I want her to wear them?

I visit her relatives and I would rather spend time with the women and children there, I never connect with the men at all.

I eventually got married to her, and I was more excited about it then she was.  People were weirded out by the way I acted.

And after the wedding I felt empty, really empty.

I feel like I became what everyone else wanted me to be and gave everything to please everyone else. And when I tried to be what I wanted to be, I was considered sick and drugged up to numb he feelings.

I honestly do not know what to do.  Would it even be worth it to try?  I am way to unstable to make enough money to pay to live as is now and will probably be a monster if I try to change anyway.

Hi, my name is Kia. I'm afab and am unfortunately prone to bouts of depression and frequent psychosis. I wasn't really aware of other gender identities for most of my life, partially because I come from a pretty conservative family. For a long time, I've wanted to be a boy. No dysphoria or anything at the time, I just thought it'd fit me better and I liked the pockets.

Around summer when I was 13, I was invited to cosplay with some friends at a convention. I chose a male character and, even though my friends said it wasn't necessary to act like the character, I did all sorts of research into how boys typically walk and act and talk so I could 'play the part right'. I practiced the walk and tried to lower my voice and all that, even though on some level I think I knew it wasn't for the cosplay. When the day finally came, someone I didn't know used he/him pronouns for me. I didn't get why, but it had an immediate impact on me. I almost started crying because of the sheer amount of emotion I felt, it was like something unlocked. Loosely, it felt like a punch you know you deserved. Painful, but right. At the time, I excused it as having a sudden, unrelated wave of emotion. Even though I thought it might have been a result of being called he, I excused it because it didn't make any sense. I had never even heard of the concept of being trans.

The same year, I got my first phone. One of the first things I did was record my voicemail, and I recorded it trying to sound lower. I just knew it was the impression I wanted to give off and didn't know why.

When my childhood best friend came out as a trans man, it was the first time I'd ever heard of anybody not actually being the gender they were born as. I didn't fully get it, but I stood by him and did my best to support him. After a lot of research and mistakes, I've come to understand him a lot better. We're still inseparable four years later, and he's recently started HRT! As proud as I am of him for coming this far, I'll admit I've found myself slightly jealous. I'd never begrudge him his happiness of course, but I just wish I could find mine too. 

The thing is, I've had other experiences besides these three which have made me question my gender, most recently extreme discomfort with my body that's lasted for months and won't go away. It's led to a major decline in my mental state and talking about it is causing friction with a really close friend (not the one mentioned above).

Idk what to do at this point. If I do turn out to be trans, my ultra conservative family will freak out. If I'm not, how do I fix the discomfort? I don't even want to be a boy that badly, I just want this incongruous feeling to stop and I'm pretty sure being a boy would fix it even if I can't put my finger on why.

Ever since I was little, I've always liked boys things more than the girl things my parents bought me. I always hated dresses and girly things like make up and stuff.

I can't even officially come out as a trans guy because I'm 99% sure, that if I do then I'll be kicked out. I'm so sure because just the way she talks. She says things like ""they[lgbtq+ people] are confused people possed by demons who are controlling their lives""(actual word for word quote) and has said similar directly towards me. She even tries to indoctrinate her kids to have that same hate. I'm glad I met people at school who showed that she was wrong. It's also frustrating because she's always going on and on about how black people and women don't have equal rights but then is opposed to lgbtq+ having the same rights. And is like she's directing that towards me because I've tried changing her mind, or at least seeing it from any point of view other than hers. She knows I've always worn tomboy type clothes but now I've been buying and wearing strictly male stuff. And I think she's catching on. I was buying some mens body wash and cologne.

I'm almost 18 so ill finally be free to be me without her.
It's been hard since the only people I know are all strict church people, so I don't have anyone that can know I'd rather have he/him pronouns and hate being called pretty, and when people pressure me into wearing a dress or make up. It's like for now, I'll I have is the internet,  but then that can't always work out. Like because no one is face to face with you, they'll say whatever hurtful comments that they want,  because they don't have any consequences. 

Why can't people just try to listen to what others have to say. If they could then the human race as a while would be some much more unified. That's why I love Detroit: Become Human so much. Not only is there a lesbian couple in the game, but they also have a strong equality message. Of course it's the android race trying to be equal with humans but, I think people should be able to apply those messages to real world things. Also The Greatest Showman,  that had a similar message. I have no idea where the fuck this is going, I i started ranting and now I'm reviewing media. In a nutshell, I'm a trans guy who has to stay passable as a girl until I have enough money to financially support myself. Once I do I'll tell my parents.

It tells me everyone is just being nice to me because there's no way anyone looks at what I've seen in my mirror and thinks woman... Sometimes I don't feel that way or see it at all... but lately I have more then usual.

I try to remind myself that I have nothing to worry about but it's so hard from me. I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder years before transitioning.

My friend thinks it's just because I haven't been full\-time very long and she's probably right. I just moved to a new town and I'm trying to be more confident now that I'm away from those who treated me badly in my hometown and I am doing a bit better but I still want to be more confident.

I'm wondering if anyone else has felt this way. If so, how did you cope with it and what can I do to make myself realize that I'm able to just be a woman now??? Is this something that just goes away over time? Any advice would be appreciated.

Sorry if this is not the appropriate place to post this but I figured this was the best way to get an answer from people who can hopefully answer without judgement. I’m sorry if I’m using the wrong pronouns anywhere...Im still learning. 

I was watching Glee recently and saw an episode with Charice (identified as female, at the time). I found out that he had recently transitioned to a male named Jake. I was curious to know if the transition had affected his singing voice and I realized it had. I was trying to discuss this with someone and didn’t know how to delicately state that his voice pre transition was drastically different than present day. 

If I said “she was so talented”, I’m assuming that’s offensive as I’m using the wrong pronoun, right? 

But if I said “he was so talented, pre transition”, I feel like that could be insensitive.

Hi, I'm Jamie, a 28 year old woman from Georgia (in the US, to avoid confusion). I can now say I've officially introduced myself as a woman! So, how did I get here? Well, if I told you my full story it would take way too long, so let's just limit it to my gender self discovery, okay?

In the summer of '89 in Atlanta, I was born. My genitalia is an outie so they put an M down on my birth certificate, gave me a guy name, and treated me like a boy. My whole life I've been expected to fulfill this mythical calling of a man. I always felt so disconnected from that role though I never had a way to place my finger on it, didn't have the words yet to say that I didn't feel like other boys and liked being around girls better.

Well, in a moment that now was totally like a second birth but at the moment should have been the death of me (actually, it was, a start of a slow death of the boy me and the birth of the girl me) I had to wear my sister's underwear one day. I actually discovered that they were nice. I wanted her underwear, though I couldn't tell anyone, boys don't want girl underwear.

It was middle school that girl me started to come out a little more. I would experiment with my sister's clothes and spend what felt like hours in front of the mirror looking like a weird boy. What boy would stuff a bra? What boy would know to hide his penis in a pair of panties? What boy would even want to look that much like a girl? Well, it turns out that boy wasn't a boy after all. She just didn't know.

When I finally got access to the internet in the house in high school, I discovered this whole world of people born like me. I still fought it for several years later. I have slowly ""adapted"" into the ways of being a man but it feels so much like an act and is finally coming to a head. I am not a man, this role is not for me. I can't fathom growing old as a man, a husband, any of the male titles.

When I am with friends, I feel so disconnected. When I am, in rare moments, able to feel comfortable enough to express myself closer to my true identity, I feel so much more...alive. It's like all the parts of me that are forced to stay hidden are able to just flow out. When I am able to think of myself as a woman, I feel like I can visualize, to an extent, being with someone as their SO, having a home that we share, hanging with the girls on the weekend, that type of stuff.

Overall, being a man kills me, being a woman brings me to life. Being a man feels like a chore despite being easy. Being a woman, despite being hard, feels so much more of what I want. I can't see forcing my body into a more masculine path. I would love so much to just, when I'm hanging with girls, be seen as one of them.",trans,Hello world!

I’m a 25 year old male who has recently began having thoughts of being the opposite sex. These feelings have come as a bit of a shock because I believed the narrative that transgender individuals always knew they were transgender to some extent. I’ve always been a fairly feminine male growing up and I don’t conform to male gender roles. I’ve always disliked my body, I’m not what you would define as masculine. I always felt that the dislike I had for my body was due to not fitting into societies expectations of what males should look like physically, but now I don’t know. I’m struggling to understand if these feelings are just my general dislike for my body or something more. 

The thoughts of wanting to be female have been increasing and I feel like I may not be coming to terms with a lot of this. I’m thinking about being seeing a professional to help me make sense of some of my feelings. This may sound silly but I’ve spent the last hour uploading different photos of myself into a an app to see what I would look like as the opposite sex. The results definitely produce a feeling inside me that more than just curiosity, but I can’t define it. One of my friends put makeup on me once and it felt right. I knew something was there afterwards, but I kind of suppressed it. when I start looking into the whole process of transitioning it scares me. I know these thoughts aren’t healthy to bottle up.

I'm a medical student working at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Our team, led by Dr. Nicole Simone, is fighting to reduce barriers to quality health care outcomes in the LGBTQ+ community.

At the moment, we're interested in investigating how barriers such as cost and stigmatization may cause patients to forgo or delay vital health care treatments or cancer screening guidelines. In short, we want to better understand how equitable, fair healthcare results can be best obtained for those in the LGBTQ+ community.

If you have a bit of time, we'd love for you to fill out the attached short survey (2 - 3 minutes)!

260,2018-06-26 18:59:01,8u2o08,1,3,"Hi, I’d say that I’m pretty new to all this, so forgive me if this seems long winded, or rambly. I just need to vent a little. If you've heard it all before, go ahead and skip down to the last few paragraphs. 

Ok...I have Gender Dysphoria... I’ve never admitted that to anyone but myself, so why not anonymously announce it to the internet. As a little background, I'm 25 and biologically male.

Ever since I was little I was envious of girls. Not for any concrete reason that I can identify, I just knew that I wanted to be one. I would stay awake late at night thinking about what it would be like if I just woke up tomorrow as a girl. The intensity of those desires has come and gone throughout my entire life, and at times I’ve gone for stretches where those feelings seemed to go away entirely… But looking back logically they never really went anywhere, they just weren’t causing me distress at those particular moments.

My feelings really came to a head these past two weeks. My dysphoria was pretty bad, but not directly disruptive so I didnt attribute how Ive been feeling to it. I felt anxious, lethargic, moody, and depressed, but I couldn’t really put a finger on where any of that was coming from exactly. Everything came crashing down when I was with my girlfriend and, looking at her I felt the attraction I always had but it was completely washed over by envy. I felt guilty having those thoughts about her, and the resulting anxiety has actually put a strain on our relationship since then. Those feelings were definitely conflicting, and I thought doing some soul searching and introspection would help me feel better but it only sent me spiralling down a crashing wave of dysphoric emotions that are more painful than I have ever felt. I feel lost, angry, and confused at why I have to feel this way and I know that my situation is not unique. I’ve been reading up on various threads on a number of trans subreddits and I know there are many out there who feel exactly the same as me,  but despite the overwhelming support that this community shows, it only further conflicted me. 

I’m at a point where I’m not quite sure what to do with myself anymore. While part of me feels that transitioning may be the right path for me, and is open to that, another feels that I just need to be more in tune with what specifically is causing my dysphoria, and accept it as a part of myself rather than resist it. I’m also completely terrified of the thought of transitioning because:

A) I’m a pretty wide built guy, so I know I would always look masculine and 

B) It has always seemed like a very extreme solution to dysphoria which from my lurking on various threads I found may never go away. So much effort put in, so much stress, only to feel the same way out the other side just isn’t something that I feel comfortable going through. Especially if there are less invasive ways to address how I feel. 

Another part just wants it to go away and embrace my assigned gender, because all things considered I do enjoy being a man. Ok... so I may not be an expert here but I’m pretty sure that last one isn’t really an option at this point, and that itself causes significant distress. I don’t hate how I look, or any specific feature about myself. There is always just that nagging urge that tells me its not right. I’m not sure how I can better describe it at this time. I also know that I am not equipped to handle those kinds of questions on my own, and I think that therapy is likely the best bet for figuring any of this out, but I don’t really know where to start with that either… or how to explain that to my girlfriend if I start going haha.

The real reason I’m writing this today, despite that massively overwritten opener, wasn’t just to vent. I promise there is a question buried in here. Probably several! 

I want to tell my parents. I know they will be supportive, even though I know initially they may not fully understand or believe me… But I’m just not sure how to start up that conversation, or what I am looking to get out of it. “Hey mom and dad, I’ve always wanted to be a girl, surprise!”

Where am I supposed to take the conversation from there, when I’m not even sure of what I want? Is it even worth talking to them about it yet? Or is there anything I can do to keep looking inward to help alleviate these feelings for the time being? I know those kinds of solutions are temporary but I think temporary relief is all I can hope for at this particular point in my life.

275,2018-06-27 20:26:27,8ud1ph,4,6,"**""Free Speech"" online now mainly protects and enables harassers, bullies and copyright trolls.**

My creative genre is science fiction. You've probably heard of [Star Wars actresses](http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/star-wars-has-a-white-male-fandom-problem) Kelly Marie Tran and Daisy Ridley being bullied off of Instagram.

And then there's the [homophobic mess surrounding Millie Bobby Brown](https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/millie-bobby-brown-acceptance-speech-bullying-mtv-awards-twitter-exit-1202850220/), when she is explicitly anti-homophobia and actively working to end that kind of behaviour. She was bullied so badly that she decided to delete her Twitter.

Always notable is the case of [Leslie Jones](https://www.etonline.com/news/193824_leslie_jones_makes_triumphant_twitter_return_after_racist_attacks), bullied off of Twitter by racists and misogynists after starring in the all-female Ghostbusters reboot.

These are famous, influential people. The average person can't even get media attention for the harassment they endure, much less call for change. So what happens? Most people stay quiet, disengage, or never contribute at all.

""Free speech"" online has been perverted to mean ""free to bully"".

**""Free"" means ""No one really cares -- and we're selling your identity.""**

There is no such thing as free.

On the internet, the computers that run your favourite websites need electricity. That costs money. They need technicians to keep networks running. That's expensive, too.


Who pays for all that technology? One way or another, you do. Either you pay upfront, or companies like Facebook (which owns Instagram and Whatsapp) [¹](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/19/technology/business/facebook-data-breach/index.html) [²](http://money.cnn.com/2018/03/19/technology/business/facebook-data-privacy-crisis/index.html?iid=EL) [³](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/business/Facebook-Fact-Check-Doesnt-Sell-But-Profits-Off-Data-479327543.html), Reddit, and Twitter collect your personal data behind your back and sell it to anyone willing to pay. Your information is sold to data brokers -- and that data is often used to bully people, [even to the point of suicide](https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2018/06/woman_who_set_self_on_fire_in.html). As in the case of Chloe Segal, a transgender artist suffering from severe mental health issues, [Facebook was part of the online harassment campaign that led to her death](https://www.dailydot.com/irl/chloe-sagal-suicide-cyberbullying-harassment/).

For vulnerable populations like minorities, women, neurodiverse and LGBT people, that can translate into real-life harassment, [blackmail](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/blackmail-online-sextortion-suicides-videos-photos-sexual-police-advice-a8337016.html), and even sophisticated campaigns to [manipulate the way you vote](https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2018/3/19/1750191/-Facebook-and-Cambridge-Analytica-gave-Steve-Bannon-a-psychological-warfare-tool-to-attack-America).

Another way that ""free"" costs is in moderated communities like Reddit. When an idiot accuses you of being an ""alt-right libertarian nazi"", moderators have no incentive to ban them. Why? Because if one person gets digusted at being harassed, it's actually better for the moderators. Helping one less person is just one less hassle to deal with. Who cares if one person leaves, as long as the subscriber count still shows that your subreddit is popular? By contrast, if you're paying five dollars per month, you can tell your friends and they can tell their friends; creators of a paid service have a real incentive (i.e. money) to keep you happy.

**Creating an alternative**

The problem isn't a lack of anti-harassment tools. The problem is culture. If the culture is rotten, the burden is unfairly placed on the wrong people to constantly fix a broken system.

""Free speech"" online now means ""rules are non-existent or inconsistently enforced; harassers and bullies are free"". ""Free"" means ""no one cares and no one will help you"". When bullies brag that their victims need to ""grow a thicker skin"", their victims just leave instead. It's not because they're too ""soft""; it's because most people have better things to do than be harassed by bigoted idiots online. Think of how many worthwhile ideas are silenced by accommodating the worst and not helping anyone else.

So there needs to be an alternative.

A new project has been underway for the past few months. We have have a set of fundamental guidelines in place.

This post has already become a lengthy blog entry, so for now, here's the main question:

293,2018-06-29 08:11:35,8urgtz,10,9,"Hello. I’m 17 years old and was born a girl. As a child my father touched me inappropriately and would physically abuse me. I barely remember it, but in 2015 I got flashbacks to it. In 2016 I started really noticing things about myself. I don’t like my body. I know I’m attractive. I don’t like having a vagina. I don’t like having boobs. I’m pretty flat, but god, it sucks! As a kid I’d wear boy clothes. I’d also wear pink sparkly stuff because sparkly stuff is pretty dang cool. However, I stopped loving sparkly things and the color pink as puberty hit me. In 2016 around the same time I started questioning my gender I began to like glitter and pink again. This time I only like pale pink. I saw lots of boys wearing that color and I just wished I could pull it off like them. 

I wish I had a penis. I wish I had abs. I wish I had facial hair. I wish I was taller. I wish I was a man. Anytime I see a male celebrity or any man I feel attracted to them. It’s an attraction that’s like “I want that” and “let me be you”. I only like girls and have only ever been attracted to girls. I’ve had the same girlfriend since 2015 and we’re long distance. She knows about this and is very accepting and warm about it. She does everything she can to make me feel comfortable and so do my friends. 

I’m too small for men’s clothes, sadly. I want to wear them so bad but my grandma doesn’t want me to do this. I feel like I’m in a costume when I wear girl clothes. I would feel natural in men’s clothes. Thinking about wearing a suit or an outfit designed for a male almost feels like a relief. 

As a kid I assumed puberty wouldn’t apply to me. I wouldn’t get a period. Why would I? And when I was younger than that I thought I’d just grow a penis. I loved cars. I still do. God, I love cars. 

I’m sorry if this is messy or silly. I’m just confused. I know only I can tell myself who I am. I just need some guidance. Did anyone else haha a similar experience? Do you think I could be trans?

As a child my father touched me inappropriately and would physically abuse me. I barely remember it, but in 2015 I got flashbacks to it. In 2016 I started really noticing things about myself. I don’t like my body. I know I’m attractive. I don’t like having a vagina. I don’t like having boobs. I’m pretty flat, but god, it sucks! As a kid I’d wear boy clothes. I’d also wear pink sparkly stuff because sparkly stuff is pretty dang cool. However, I stopped loving sparkly things and the color pink as puberty hit me. In 2016 around the same time I started questioning my gender I began to like glitter and pink again. This time I only like pale pink. I saw lots of boys wearing that color and I just wished I could pull it off like them. \n\nI wish I had a penis. I wish I had abs. I wish I had facial hair. I wish I was taller. I wish I was a man. Anytime I see a male celebrity or any man I feel attracted to them. It’s an attraction that’s like “I want that” and “let me be you”. I only like girls and have only ever been attracted to girls. I’ve had the same girlfriend since 2015 and we’re long distance. She knows about this and is very accepting and warm about it. She does everything she can to make me feel comfortable and so do my friends. \n\nI’m too small for men’s clothes, sadly. I want to wear them so bad but my grandma doesn’t want me to do this. I feel like I’m in a costume when I wear girl clothes. I would feel natural in men’s clothes. Thinking about wearing a suit or an outfit designed for a male almost feels like a relief. \n\nAs a kid I assumed puberty wouldn’t apply to me. I wouldn’t get a period. Why would I? And when I was younger than that I thought I’d just grow a penis. I loved cars. I still do. God, I love cars. \n\nI’m sorry if this is messy or silly. I’m just confused. I know only I can tell myself who I am. I just need some guidance. Did anyone else haha a similar experience? Do you think I could be trans? My friends think so and so does my brother who is also trans. He’s older than me and recently started T and I’m so happy for him but also felt strangely jealous. \n\nAny advice is welcome.

I've been on full HRT for 6 months (4 mg beta estradiol in the morning, 200 mg teva spironolactone in the morning, 200 mg teva spironolactone at night) and I was one just spiro for a month or two before I started full HRT. Despite being on HRT for 6 months, and seeing multiple images of trans folks pre-hrt or on hrt for only a couple months with beautiful results and who pass wonderfully, all I have to show for it are barely-A cup breasts (expected by this time), and almost nothing else. I don't notice any differences in my face, or in my skin, or anything else really. I begin uni (B. maths hon.) in sep. and start a job in a couple days, and both of those stacked on top of eachother, knowing full well that I don't pass in the slightest, just terrifies me. 

Over the past couple months, I've just been mentally feeling worse and worse. I've been crying for almost a half hour each day (a big jump from even a month ago), and I had a breakdown a couple days ago, locked myself in a car while crying uncontrollably for 2 hours, begged my father to drive me to a crisis center (none of them were open :/ ), and cried myself to sleep with a plastic bag, duct tape, and sleeping pills beside me (you can probably guess what I was planning to do with those). I fell asleep from the sleeping pills before I could do anything with the other 2. 

I genuinely believe I won't ever pass.

FFS isn't covered by any insurance, and I don't have the money to drop on it, and probably never will. I probably won't be able to take the recovery time off work either.

Every time I see someone who I think looks pretty, whether or not they're trans, I almost always start sobbing uncontrollably. 

I'm 99% sure that the only person I've genuinely loved isn't interested in me (and there's nothing wrong with that, all power to them, but it just piles on top of everything else that makes me miserable)

I'm going to be on a residence floor for girls only (since men terrify me) and I'm very very worried that I'll be harassed or given looks or not accepted.

Among a plethora of other things, I honestly have no reason that I would want to continue living.

305,2018-06-30 13:08:51,8v1qik,4,1,"Hi everyone!

I’ve been scrolling through this subreddit for a while and decided to make a account as I’ve recently started questioning my gender identity and I wanted to talk about my experience - I’m a 22 year old female.

So far I’ve been doing most of my research through the trans community on youtube and a few blog posts here and there that I’ve found through late night googling

I’ve been aware of the trans community since I was around 16/17 but I hadn’t really thought it applied to me up until a few weeks ago.

I’ve always had issues with self confidence which I know is something many people struggle with. In terms of my body, I don’t feel like I hate it but when I look in the mirror it just feels like it’s ‘there’ and that’s it. I’ve never felt a sense of pride when looking at my features. I don’t mind my chest but I know I’d prefer if it wasn’t there, it just feels like it gets in the way at the moment.

Deep down I feel like I’ve never really been able to relate to girls. I was always a tom-boy, would always gravitated towards the boys clothes section or toy sections of shops when I was little, and have always picked boy avatars/characters in video games.

I’ve never felt comfortable in clothes that are ‘girly’ - dresses and skirts always seemed strange to me, and whenever I’m in a clothes shop with friends I never see the appeal of the women’s section. I’ve been shopping in men’s sections for shirts and t-shirts since I was old enough to go out and buy my own clothes. When I’m wearing a masculine outfit I’m proud of is when I feel most confident.

I’ve never worried much about shaving, whenever I’ve shaved my legs (which is usually only when it gets hot in summer) I’ve always found it quite a hassle and just thought ‘can I not just leave them like this and wear shorts anyway?”

Another factor that I’ve been thinking about is I don’t think I’ve ever had a female role-model. (I’m going to use musicians as the example for this as I’m a musician and in a band and I find it the easiest example to explain.) Whenever I would watch videos of bands with female members in I’d always think ‘oh she’s really cool, you go girl!’ But I would often look at the male members of the bands (mostly the bass players as I play bass) and think ‘wow he’s awesome I’d love to be like him!.’ I can certainly look at women and admire them for who they are and what they do but I’ve never felt like I could really relate to them

In terms of my name, I don’t dislike it but I don’t think it feels right, at least not in more recent years. I was speaking to a close friend about all of this earlier today and trying to explain my feelings towards my name and she summed it up quite well by saying ‘Is it almost just a word people use to get your attention?” and that’s exactly how it feels.

I’m sure there’s more points I could write down but these are the main ones that are coming to mind now. This is all extremely new for me to talk about so sorry if a lot of it has just been me rambling on!

I’d love to get opinions from you guys and possibly some advice too as I’m still trying to wrap my head around everything

1. The way I define gender is as a means of identifying people based on social constructs \(as opposed to biological ones\). If this differs to your definition, why? If it doesn't, how are there sets of social constructs for all the new genders that haven't fully been introduced into our society?
2. This is only really directed towards the term 'transgender', although I've seen similar terms used. If transgender means that you have transitioned from one gender to another, does that not make your gender the gender you have transitioned to, rather than your gender being 'transgender'? For example, if you transitioned from female to male, wouldn't your gender be 'male' and 'transgender' would simply be a description?
3. I'm always open to changing my opinion, but I currently strongly reject the idea of identifying as non\-human. If you believe that it is genetic or has any other scientific backing, what's your reasoning for this? If you believe that it is a religious/spiritual concept then I think that just falls into the larger debate on the existence of spirits/deities.

So here is the thing, throughout my life starting at childhood, my dad would scold me about things men were supposed to do, and shouldn't do. One day this discussion was brought up while talking about denin colors. Back then it was very difficult to find any jeans that were not gray,blue,dark blue or black for boys/guys. I snapped and said to him ""I wish I was a girl so I don't have to worry about all these restrictions."" That was when he smacked me and said never to say that again.


Fast forward nearly 18 years later, those remarks that he made to me still haunt me everyday that I wake up. They make me feel like shit, and up until I met my current girlfriend I suppressed my desires. It turns out that I actually enjoy wearing women's clothing to an extent. I would love to wear a skirt on a hot summer day because Jeans or shorts are too hot. I would love to wear dresses or night gowns in my house at night, i would even enjoy wearing leggings if given the chance. I've opened up to my girlfriend about it, but she is very reluctant to think its acceptable to do so. I told her how my father made me feel and how I still feel today, but she feels as though she has to act more masculine since I want to wear more feminine clothing. 

I basically broke it down to her and said ""If we were single, and I was trying to ""bag"" another woman, it would make it harder on myself  if I approached them in a dress. However if i got to meet them and we fell in love with eachother and then I showcased my interest in wearing women clothing, I would feel like the social stigmas dont apply anymore because who cares what others think if youre not trying to pursue them. You still love me for me at this point so it doesnt matter how I dress because I'm not trying to impress society. The ""game"" is over, now we can be ourselves and our masks can come off.

Yesterday we went shopping and I found a croptop, the first croptoo I ever purchased in my life. I THOUGHT this is my moment, I gotta get it and its only $8, whats to lose? I tried it on and wore it out to dinner and didnt give two fucks about anyone's opinion. Today, she told me she didnt like what I did and would not like me to wear women's cloths outside again.

This is a very frustrating point in my life. I'm a straight male that just likes getting in touch with my feminine side. It has nothing to do with my orientation so I don't see why she is getting so upset over it. Every discussion we have always lead to her basically trying to say I don't want to be male. I can't change what I am at birth but the one thing I did learn about being a guy is that once you're an adult you shouldn't have to adhere to any rules as long as its not harming anyone.

I am a binary trans guy who is dating an AFAB non binary partner. I am seeking help because as of late, my partner's feelings of dysphoria and frustration with the binary has been getting worse and worse. 

Obviously, I am trans and can relate to their general feelings of dysphoria, but I feel like because I am binary, I cannot fully relate to their frustrations.

To make things worse, their upbringing was highly religious (ofc lol) and when they were very young, told their parents that they were a boy... Which then led to their parents questioning them at a very young age about it. Which of course, went terribly.

I feel so bad and helpless.. I share my experiences with them and reassure them that there's nothing wrong with being trans and that they're totally fine the way they are, but they are still doubting themselves.

To make things worse, we've been trying to get them a therapist for MONTHS now. Ugh. No fucking luck. It has been a struggle.

I love them very much and want them to know that I support them and care about them, but I feel like I'm not doing enough/could be doing more?

Ugh, I don't know. I just wish they could work on accepting themselves and loving them for who they are: an amazing nonbinary person.

They also work 50-60 hour weeks, so things like support groups could be very hard to find based on the time/day that they meet. Sighhh.

Last night and this morning, I stayed up trying to configure a DIY gaffe, figuring out how to use it, and researching basically everything related to AMAB binding after a fellow nonbinary pal discussed their experiences with it. After a few tries, I made a competent gaffe from an old black tube sock and a pajama waistband; I was determined to try this out, after weeks of intensified \(fluctuating\) genital dysphoria. 

I realized that a lot of stuff out there related to AMAB binding talked a lot about ""tucking"", or sliding the testicles up into the inguinal hole. This scares the living shit out of me, as I've always had an antsy relationship with my balls, and messing with them seems....eh.

So what I did \(for about half of the day\) was placed my gaffe over my underwear, essentially flattening the look of the pelvic area; but I could never tuck, it was just too ech for me. 

Throughout the day, I re\-adjusted when the compression was either causing discomfort \(ie too tight/weird\), or was too camel\-toey \(ie not firm enough\). When noon came around, I decided to call that friend I referenced earlier, due to uncertainty about all this. They seemed to think that compression could actually be more physically dangerous than tucking, and when I talked about being uncomfortable with tucking, they seemed to be unsure about it all. 

There is so little research about the harms of these techniques, and I can't seem to get anyone to speak \(anecdotally or medically\) to the affects of occasional compression without tucking, the one that I kinda liked a lot.

I am AFAB and I am currently identifying as genderqueer/fluid. 

I wouldn't say I am *unhappy* as a girl, but I feel restricted by the assumption that I am a certain way cos I have tits.

It's not even about ""people expect me to act a certain way because I am a girl"" it's that people expect me to act a certain way because I have the SEXUAL characteristics of a woman,
so they assume that is what I am, or like, at least, that's the EXTENT of my identity?
If that makes sense?

I feel like people see tits and go ""That is a woman. Gonna treat this person like a woman. They must act like the woman I view them as or they are weird and not a good woman!"" 

Is the way I feel, as a trans/NB person, based on the description above, social dysphoria, or just me being a cis woman trying to break the barriers of gender roles?

I have this feeling of ""wanting to be trans"" because I am scared to be cis now that I have opened this can of worms, and I feel a lot of anxiety around the whole ""am I cis?"" question.  

I am really struggling with depressed and suicidal moods since I began questioning my gender and am honestly just reaching out for validation.

I'm AFAB, and the main thing that got me wondering about gender was that I really wanted a flat chest. This made me wonder a bit since I *also* have anorexia, and the way in which I view my body is undoubtedly affected by it, so I'm not sure if it's just a product of my ED and shouldn't have anything to do with gender identity. However, I do remember feeling disappointed when I got breast development, or something, and that was before my eating disorder.

I don't have any discomfort about the other parts of my body, I guess, if only partially due to the fact that I lost weight due to an eating disorder and that it's ""easier"" to look androgynous at a thinner weight. I don't care about my periods since for me it is more of a medical thing to me. I never really understood it as ""it's part of being a woman"" or something and always thought the statement to be rather comical—like, why should I care about being a ""woman"" or something.

I'm actually quite feminine in terms of personality. I don't like sports, and I like cute things. I like feminine clothing like dresses and leggings. Clearly, these things don't determine my gender identity since they're just personality. However, they're probably the main things that keep me using she/her and identifying as female/a girl—the fact that I am AFAB and it'd be useful in a medical sense and the fact that the places specific to my interests such as r/femalefashionadvice are mainly populated by women and girls.

To be honest, I'm not even sure what the difference is between being nonbinary/genderqueer and being cis since I don't think that most people really think about their gender identities—clearly, not everyone's genderqueer/NB. I guess for me, I don't feel comfortable being included in ""the girls"" or ""the guys""—but it might just be because of sexism, like the fact that I don't want to be part of any gendered group due to the stereotypes.

To be honest, I (and I hesitate to link these articles since they're controversial) don't know how to resolve certain mental conflicts. I think I've read this argument that nonbinary can't exist innately, like it's just a political label since all NB people tend to be leftist, or something. Or that it's just a fad. I'm definitely not saying that I'm agreeing, but I'm just not sure how to mentally process this. -_-;;

65,2018-06-09 15:47:11,8ptnax,34,43,"So like, there are obvious reasons why I like hanging out in trans and nonbinary communities. I am trans and nonbinary! I have gotten huge amounts of support, insight, and guidance from fellow trans and nonbinary people, including from binary trans people. I also like banding together with people to work on common goals.

I feel a tension though sometimes in that if I interact too much with highly dysphoric trans people, my own dysphoria gets worse.

I think I am a very empathetic person and I am very affected by others feelings, and that may play a role. I also feel some degree of social pressure, especially in binary trans communities, in the form of people being more likely to see me as ""legitimately trans"" if I have dysphoria (or have greater dysphoria). In extreme cases this plays out in terms of negativity or exclusion directed at me, but more often it's more subtle -- people seeming to focus on the topic of dysphoria.

For me, my dysphoria sometimes gets worse from talking about it. It usually gets better when I'm thinking more abstractly and more rationally.

Also, sometimes I feel like certain trans and nonbinary people are propagating ideas or ways of thinking that I consider to be characteristic of mental disorder, including depression, anxiety, and sometimes other disorders. As someone who has struggled intensely with depression in the past, and to some degree with anxiety, it is very hard for me to be exposed to these perspectives. I find this a problem in left-wing subcultures in general, that there is a tendency for certain ideas to circulate which I feel vulnerable to. And this interacts with dysphoria, because for me, the worse my mental illness is, the more likely I am to experince dysphoria more strongly.

I have found that bringing these topics up often doesn't go well. People often get defensive and often attack me. Mental illness and mental health can be a very touchy subject, and I feel like I'm often put in the impossible position of (a) feeling negatively affected by certain ideas and wanting to challenge them (b) having other people be personally vested in those ideas and take offense personally and often attack me if I do challenge them.

An idea would be when people advance the idea that hormonal transition is the only or best way to treat certain types of dysphoria. For me, believing this idea makes me feel worse, because there are certain reasons I do not want to pursue hormonal transition, so this makes me feel hopeless if I start buying into this. But when I argue with this idea, people sometimes take it personally. I don't like dealing with this sort of conflict and negativity, and it often makes me just want to leave the trans communities where this sort of dialogue is taking place.

I am curious if these struggles or experiences resonate with anyone, and also, if people have any tips or advice for how to navigate this stuff more gracefully. I tend to have a very thin skin emotionally, I am very sensitive and I often don't know how to insulate myself from the emotional effects of some of this stuff.",genderqueer,Dysphoria Made Worse by Trans and Some Nonbinary Communities,1528584431.0,"{'created_utc': 1528559231, 'id': '8ptnax', 'num_comments': 34, 'score': 43, 'selftext': 'So like, there are obvious reasons why I like hanging out in trans and nonbinary communities.

**Taking Action**

I took a good month to really think about what I wanted and find out what other people have done to lessen period symptoms. 10 years ago, when I first went on the pill, I was a hormonal teenager going through a lot of life lessons. After I rage quit the pill, I upheld the belief that the hormonal birth control pill was a negative influence on my life.

I changed my belief because I realized that hormonal birth control was the best short-term fix to the gender dysphoria I was experiencing and decided to give myself a year on the pill to see what happened.

**Month 1 of pill**

I started Altavera (0.15mg Levonorgestrel and 0.03mg Ethinyl Estrodiol) a few weeks after I got the prescription at Planned Parenthood right after my next period ended.

On the first day of the pill, I was still spotting a little from my period. Then I had 4 glorious normal days. Unfortunately, I had spotting on the 6th to 21st day on the pill. I knew this was a part of the challenge because my body was getting used to a new substance. I had a bad cold and a few other health issues during the first month so I can't say much for symptoms other than the spotting.

The period was hilarious, day 1 off the pill I had spotting, then 1.5 days of a light period, 1.5 days of spotting, and 2 days normal. It was weird, but I accepted it and let my mind dive head first into the belief that I would not have any more spotting like I did the first month.

**Month 2 of pill**

I am now on day 10 of my second pill pack and have not had any spotting! It feels great, I feel normal and I intend to attract good energy to keep this lack-of-a-streak going. I'm really optimistic about the next few months on the 21-day on pill 7-day off cycle while my body adjusts.

Some of the symptoms other than spotting that I have noticed and attribute only to the new hormones in my body include noticeably larger breasts, occasional nausea, and increased sex drive.

My breasts are now a little under a half size bigger than they were before because of the hormones. This isn't a big deal to me, but I wanted to list this off for anyone else who might not want that.

The nausea is unlike anything I've felt before. I've sure had nausea before but this feeling isn't like the other types. I get a little dizzy, a bit more tired, and very sensitive to moving my body. It lasts a few minutes up to a few hours. When it's short, like it was just a little bit ago, it feels like I'm hungry but I'm not hungry and usually has a bigger wave of dizziness. When it lasts longer than 30 minutes, it's constant but with less dizziness and I need to stay in the same spot until it passes. These episodes, short and long, happen around 4 times a week and I don't think they're triggered by anything. But they are getting better with time.

The increased sex drive is a little bit annoying. I don't have any sexual issues right now but it kinda sucks to get really horny in the middle of the workday. Nobody else is complaining about this symptom :)

**Future Plans**

I understand that the pill is going to mess with my body for at least another month or two. Once I feel my body is used to the hormones, probably 4-6 months into the prescription, I intend to start combining pill packs to have a period every 6 weeks and see how my body responds.

I feel very strongly that my body needs to go through periods every once in a while, and my aim with the pill and my dysphoria is to reduce period symptoms, flow, length, and feel like I have more control over a part of my life I've hated since it started.

Long-term I am looking into getting a hysterectomy or pursuing other medical treatment so that I am not on the pill for too many years. This is a temporary fix to a larger problem that I need time to work through, and I'm glad this option is starting to work out well for me.

I've known I'm agender since I was probably 6 or 7, but didn't know the word until I was around 12, and I've identified that way ever since.
Anyway enough about that

My bottom dysphoria didn't used to be too bad. As of late, honestly, it's almost as bad as my chest dysphoria (which is overwhelming most days). I pack a lot of the time, and I know I'd much rather have a penis than what I currently have, but even the idea of that makes me dysphoric. It's just
An improvement.
Really, what I want (and what ive wanted for years) is to have no genitals (also cw for genital terminology coming up)
whatsoever, and I know that's the only way to erase any bottom dysphoria I have.
Problem is, again, the afab thing.
I've seen minimal information on things like this for amab people, and I've seen absolutely none regarding afab people.
I know I could look into a vaginectomy and clitorectomy (not sure what the procedure is to deal with the labia).
To my knowledge though, this is considered FGM in western countries, so I'm not sure how I would even find a surgeon to do it.

Even if I successfully found a surgeon, I don't want to imagine the cost (im poor and i grew up poor. I literally cannot afford something like this if insurance wont cover it), and I cant even ensure that it would be aesthetically pleasing (or even possible) given that all results ive seen are from amab people.

112,2018-06-19 21:19:22,8sclbq,2,10,"one day in 2014, a friend asked me “are you sure you want to be with her, or maybe do you want to be her?”

i thought about it for a few minutes and i realised the second thing was as true as the first. the moment i admitted/realized this, the past reconfigured itself like in the movies, and i recalled a lot of things i stopped thinking about.

as a child, i liked girls a lot. meaning i wanted to be like them. i looked at them and it felt like they had many more possibilities than boys. in dresses, in games, in feelings. i was comfortable with my delicacy, my fragility, i liked to be like that. my parents never tried to “correct” me. i didn’t feel wrong, weird, i was simply me. and happy.

i looked like a girl. “what a lovely girl you have”, people told my mother. i loved it.

as a teen i retained an androgynous beauty. i kept feeling tightly confined in the boy role. i remember one time when i was 13. there was a team game and my team decided to make it a music show: i was to be the valletta (italian term to describe the girl usually \*helping\* the male host in tv shows… i know).

i jumped at the opportunity. i put on heels, a short dress, make up. everyone started to compliment me, telling me what a beautiful girl and stuff like that. i felt great, i loved this kind of unusual attention, and i loved looking in the mirror. the show was about to start when the boy playing the male host wanted to dance with me. i just said “no” i did not like boys, i liked girls. and i also liked to be one, that night.

it felt so incredibly special, and right.

then puberty hit.  
suddenly i looked in the mirror and i saw someone different.  
my body, and especially my face, had changed.  
i could not see a girl anymore, i would not ever be like that night again.   
I felt a little sad, but being pragmatic i just said to myself “ok, i’m a male. stop”

and i really stopped looking inside, for a long time.

and then boom. that question in 2014.  
suddenly i saw things take new shape and meaning.  
my eternal struggle with “typical male behaviour”. trying to avoid at all costs to go out in all males groups.  
the eternal annoyance about what is considered male and what female.  
the very strong discomfort towards my body, but also towards the concrete possibilities to change it (i swear, if one day i wake up with a six-pack i will immediately go to drink some drain cleaner).

now i’m like this, confused. alien inside myself. but an alien i’m used to.

there are so many choices, i could say i’m agender, trans, genderfluid, i could… i’m not really interested in labels, but i would really like to understand myself better.

i thought about it, i don’t think transition is for me, or trying to pass and such things. of course if i could snap my fingers and become anna karina, i would do that right now. but operations… no.   
and with my appeareance, i don’t think that would work at all. i look good enough as a man, i would not look like i feel as a woman. maybe i’m shallow.

but i’m finding more and more frustrating to let people see me as a man “stop”.

i’m thinking about nail polish, about eyliner, about… i don’t know, i’m also shy so thinking to attract attention it’s another problem in this loving and accepting society (yes, it’s sarcasm).

but if i stay like this what am i? a fake? i don’t really know. i’m afraid to feel or be made to feel like an impostor in queer spaces. do i worry too much?

i would like to hear some thought about it. of course i don’t want you to decide what’s my identity.  
but i’m just so damn confused that reading something not generated in my head maybe could help.

i know this was long af, so if no one will have the patience to get to the end, i will understand. i think in part i just needed to vent. i can take it.

But I wanted to just post about a couple of things pertaining to today. So here they are, probably scrambled and messy.

First up is that today is a special day for me. Two years ago to this day (ie last Wednesday of June) was the day I discovered what non-binary meant...

Well I mean I knew what non-binary meant. It's a pretty simple word. ""Not associated or connected to a binary system."" It's more that this day was the day I realised what it meant in context to gender. Now I can't say that I immediately dropped all pretense and leapt into the NB pool. It took me another month of digging, researching and self-reflecting before I got there but today was the day the fireworks were lit. The day my brain was introduced to the thing I'd been missing all these years. A way to explain all my quirks regarding my own gender growing up. It was the light that let me explore myself. So I'd like to thank whoever wrote that awful trash of a fanfic for just dumping the concept there in the first two paragraphs. (also don't ask for the name of it, it was tripe - bad grammar, no concern for story structure and thin characters)

Next I'd like to say thanks.

To all of you.

To everyone who's brave enough to post pictures of themselves here (yes it's a safe space for us but it still takes some courage) in all your queer glory.

To everyone who gifts us with a new story to read, to relate to and to discuss.

To everyone who comes here seeking comfort for the woes and aches they feel in the outside world... and for all of those who do their utmost to reassure them that they *are not alone*.

To those who come seeking information, about themselves, their children or their loved ones. Or even just to understand our plights and joys.

To all of you.

Thanks so much for making these last (almost) two years of my life full of hope and joy.


Last thing. Going through my phone to find a gif of an exploding head (makes sense in context shut up) I was pleasantly surprised.

I got my new phone early last year and I am so glad that there isn't a single picture or representation of me on it that doesn't scream ""Trans!"" It's nice to see that despite the doubts of those surrounding me sometimes that I haven't wavered in my commitment to myself these last two years.

Again Thank You All and here's hoping for many more  great years spent exploring ourselves.

I came across a TERF on twitter who was against gender diversity and basically said I was coopting the female gender and making it unsafe for women.

Instead, she went through the typical radfem gymnastics of talking about society as a whole:  
&gt; how nonbinary expression threw the ""poor normal people"" as normies under the bus. How it makes them look bad for not drinking the cool aid?? How they get forced to conform to the minority?

&gt;(gaslighting lies about transsexual allies, appeal to historical cishet stories, sufragettes surely must be nonbinary, gender is definition wordsalad, etc etc)

I am a 30 year old, married AFAB. I have been questioning my gender for a few years now. More recently the questioning has been more insistent and in the front of my mind. 

A few months ago, I could have sworn to you I was definitely a transman. The urge and need to have a flat chest, body and facial hair, and penis were intense. Then slowly the intensity faded. I no longer had the intense need to have these things. 

The thought is always there though. My husband is the only person who knows that I'm even questioning, and he has actually been super supportive and told me he'd love me regardless. He, however, is the only one I trust to even come out to as questioning. 

There are times when I feel feminine. I dont mind wearing makeup, doing my hair and wearing dresses.

No matter what though, I only feel comfortable sexually if I am a man. I do not feel comfortable with my chest ever. I always wear a shirt and I do not like my husband playing with them. I hate that they flop around! 

I'm just so confused with who I am.

Reasons I dont believe I am for sure a man are that I do enjoy being my husbands wife, I enjoy my girl time with the few girl friends I have, and I love being a mom to my kids. Being female isnt something I hate.

Reasons I think I am a man are I hate my chest and always have, the thought of being a man excites me. I would love to have a beard and Male genitals. I can only get turned on believing I am a man and my husband calling me by my chosen male name and pronouns.

The reason I keep going back and forth are because the intensity of these feelings change. I am absolutely terrified to come out as trans or even genderfluid pr bigender because my family and friends would not be okay with this. What if I come out and realize I'm not??? What if I chose to stay female and am not as happy as I could be because I am male?

Wow! Figuring out who you are is not easy and my mind wont shut off with all these thoughts! The need to at the very least have a beard on some days and flat chest is always present. I'm terrified and I am inspired and in awe of all the people who can transition regardless of there fears!

26,2018-06-06 18:12:06,8p2xvu,2,4,"Hi, all, long time lurker, but finally felt the need to post something.

I've recently started thinking I might be genderfluid. Ever since I can remember, even though I'm AMAB, I've never fully felt like a boy or man. It's hard to determine if it's just because I like a lot of feminine-coded things, and generally pretty non-masculine, or if I actually have times when I'm not a man and something else. 

I've started thinking that I really do have times when I ""switch"" from guy mode to something else, probably demi-girl mode. (In part because Eddie Izzard has recently said that genderfluid most accurately describes his identity, and I've always felt like the way I feel about my own gender is how Izzard talks about his.) I try not to think about it too much: because of professional and family reasons I think it'll be a long time before I can really start experimenting with androgynous gender performance or presenting demi when feeling that way.

Now, the source of the tension: despite my growing thought that I'm probably genderfluid, the start of Pride Month has made me kind of realize that I don't really identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community or feel like this month is for me. I guess it's a version of the kind of concern, ""What if I'm not really queer?"" But I don't know if it's just because I'm just now starting to figure myself out—so, up to this point, I *really haven't* been a member of the community—that I don't identify with this group.


Anyone experience something like this?

There are some things that kind of confuse me, so I figured out, why not ask you people.

Based on what things do you change if you never were an actual male? Does a haircut and specific clothes really cut it?

I'm not sure if not liking it is due to something deep down, or just because my parents happened to be the ones who gave it to me. Of names that I have come across, Timothy and Jason are my favorites. I can't really make myself go by Timothy, or any form of though, because my father's name is too similar. So Jason it is. Please, call me Jay.

I'm a college student, a psychology major. I transferred to my university after 2 long ass years at community college. The community I grew up in, and spent near 21 years in, is very much conservative and religious. I'd never met anyone who wasn't straight or not strictly born male or female. Sure, they were and are there, but I only saw them from a distance, and they never stuck around for long. After coming out, they never returned the following school year. They were all demonized by the church or ostracized by the school. Anyway, after I transferred I made some friends my first semester, all of them in the marching band. We never really hung out after season was over though. So I decided to rush a sorority that's associated with the school of music.

That second semester is what I like to call both the self discovery semester and the beginning of my depression year. Long story short, my Big is gay af, and one of the most amazing humans I've ever met. In fact, a good 3/4 of the sorority is either not straight, not binary, or both. My little homophobic/transphobic ass went for a spin. I learned and I grew. I got really overwhelmed with social things and subsequently came out of some of my social anxiety. I also got overwhelmed with school work and learned the hard way that my major at the time, education, wasn't for me. Start the depression year. It was also the semester I said 'fuck it', and changed my major to psychology. I told no one. Literally walked into the psych building, filled out the papers, and took them straight to the dean's office. I told no one until a couple weeks later when I got a tentative acceptance to the major, dependent on me passing a summer class.

The beginning of my 2nd year at university, it was a time. I finally got to see the inner workings of my sorority, and all of the drama within it. I still love them anyway. I was bullied in marching band for having panic attacks during auditions. I finished the pre-reqs for my major.

In August I discovered that I am asexual. I came out to my best friend in September.

In November I discovered my attraction to women, in addition to men. So I came out as biromantic.

Biromantic asexual.

It wasn't until this past semester, maybe around February, that I started feeling something different. I wasn't quite sure what it was. Due to the environment of where I grew up, I was never allowed to explore anything regarding myself. Basically a carbon copy of my parents. But after almost 2 years of living in a college town, I felt something. Something that I needed to explore. At first I thought I might be a trans male, but it didn't fit.

The feeling comes and goes, and it varies in strength. Sometimes I feel a little feminine, though rarely. Sometimes I feel masculine, though not entirely. I often feel in between, kind of neither. I think I lean more toward masculine and that somewhere in between, rarely going to feminine. I don't know if it's really something I feel within me, or if it's a part of me rejecting how and where I was raised, forced into the feminine role and stereotype.

There are some aspects of femininity I'm not sure I want to give up. But there are so many things I don't want to be a part of. I feel more comfortable in more masculine things. Today especially, being in a clothing store and longing to buy 'men's' jeans, boxers, and suits. I know that clothing doesn't have gender, but it's like a longing to look like them. To be lean and fit with boyish long hair. To be able to pull off a suit like that. Something my really af female body can't do, at least it the way I want it too.

I don't like my female body or my female name. I want a masculine or androgynous body with a masculine name. But I'm afraid. Sometimes I feel like I desperately want to transition to male. Sometimes I feel comfortable enough just downplaying my more feminine features. Sometimes I want to cut my long ass hair into that boyish cut, but I'm terrified I'll instantly regret it and have to live with it. I'm afraid to tell my friends, even though I know they'd be totally accepting. The only time I can admit it to myself is when I've had at least half a bottle of wine. So take this as my testament.

I don't know wtf I am. I want to explore, but I'm terrafrickingfied. I've just gained acceptance into my friend group, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I have no idea who I am or who I want to be. Sometimes I want to be the person I've grown to be, even with the name and baggage that comes with what I was assigned. Sometimes I want to go for it, be Jason, be him, a part of me. Some part of me desperately wants out, and I have no idea if it's a suppressed part of me, or if it's the Jason I've suppressed all my life.

I am Jason when I can admit it to myself, which is most often when I've been drinking. Other times I just settle for some version of what I was assigned.",genderfluid,feel free to ignore this,1529056342.0,"{'created_utc': 1529031142, 'id': '8r7op7', 'num_comments': 2, 'score': 6, 'selftext': ""So I'm not going to share my real/given name because of privacy, and I kind of don't really like it.

Literally walked into the psych building, filled out the papers, and took them straight to the dean's office. I told no one until a couple weeks later when I got a tentative acceptance to the major, dependent on me passing a summer class.\n\nThe beginning of my 2nd year at university, it was a time. I finally got to see the inner workings of my sorority, and all of the drama within it. I still love them anyway. I was bullied in marching band for having panic attacks during auditions. I finished the pre-reqs for my major.\n\nIn August I discovered that I am asexual. I came out to my best friend in September.\n\nIn November I discovered my attraction to women, in addition to men. So I came out as biromantic.\n\nBiromantic asexual.\n\nIt wasn't until this past semester, maybe around February, that I started feeling something different. I wasn't quite sure what it was. Due to the environment of where I grew up, I was never allowed to explore anything regarding myself. Basically a carbon copy of my parents. But after almost 2 years of living in a college town, I felt something. Something that I needed to explore. At first I thought I might be a trans male, but it didn't fit.\n\nThe feeling comes and goes, and it varies in strength. Sometimes I feel a little feminine, though rarely. Sometimes I feel masculine, though not entirely. I often feel in between, kind of neither. I think I lean more toward masculine and that somewhere in between, rarely going to feminine. I don't know if it's really something I feel within me, or if it's a part of me rejecting how and where I was raised, forced into the feminine role and stereotype.\n\nThere are some aspects of femininity I'm not sure I want to give up. But there are so many things I don't want to be a part of. I feel more comfortable in more masculine things. Today especially, being in a clothing store and longing to buy 'men's' jeans, boxers, and suits. I know that clothing doesn't have gender, but it's like a longing to look like them. To be lean and fit with boyish long hair. To be able to pull off a suit like that. Something my really af female body can't do, at least it the way I want it too.\n\nI don't like my female body or my female name. I want a masculine or androgynous body with a masculine name. But I'm afraid. Sometimes I feel like I desperately want to transition to male. Sometimes I feel comfortable enough just downplaying my more feminine features. Sometimes I want to cut my long ass hair into that boyish cut, but I'm terrified I'll instantly regret it and have to live with it. I'm afraid to tell my friends, even though I know they'd be totally accepting. The only time I can admit it to myself is when I've had at least half a bottle of wine. So take this as my testament.\n\nI don't know wtf I am. I want to explore, but I'm terrafrickingfied. I've just gained acceptance into my friend group, and I don't want to jeopardize that. I have no idea who I am or who I want to be. Sometimes I want to be the person I've grown to be, even with the name and baggage that comes with what I was assigned. Sometimes I want to go for it, be Jason, be him, a part of me. Some part of me desperately wants out, and I have no idea if it's a suppressed part of me, or if it's the Jason I've suppressed all my life.\n\nI am Jason when I can admit it to myself, which is most often when I've been drinking. Other times I just settle for some version of what I was assigned."", 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'feel free to ignore this', 'created': 1529056342.0}"

(Might be slightly NSFW at parts, by the way)

For background: As a child, I never really experienced any dysphoria. I was happy being a girly girl, and sometimes a tomboy, not really thinking anything of my gender. I can recall a few hints, but only once I started middle school. I clearly recall envying characters like Haruhi from OHSHC (yes, very cliche) for being able to pass as both a girl and boy. I always wished I could be them. And I remember distinctly this one time my dad was driving me to school, and I thought how cool would be if I could just crossdress as a boy to school for a week and have no one know. I would fantasize what it would be like to be a boy for a day more than once throughout my teen years. Plus, I was kinda into yaoi back then (another cliche, huh?). I've also struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 10 or younger, but towards the end of my teens, I felt like my medication wasn't helping me much anymore inexplicably. What confuses me most is that I learned about being trans and non-binary about when I was 14-15 years old on tumblr, definitions and all, yet it never clicked back then? I thought maybe I could be agender for a moment but I quickly abandoned that idea... I never understood genderfluid tho, until... well, now. The fact that none of it ever clicked and I don't think I ever felt blatant dysphoria is kinda messing with me. The only time I can recall having something close to dysphoria, is was when my boobs grew into size B and the first thing that came to mind is, ""Fuck, it's going to be harder to bind -- for crossplay of course!!"". I felt weirdly upset, despite wanting a bigger chest when I was younger... that confused me at the time.

I guess I always blew it off for one big reason. I've always have been into girly things, mostly in fashion. I LOVE being cute and wearing pastel colors. I love sweet lolita, fairy kei and other super feminine styles and aesthetics. For reasons like that I've always felt reasonably secure in my womanhood and took pride in it even. 

But thanks to one too many gay shitposts on here, I think I've opened Pandora's box on myself. A lot of the doubts so I'm having are the typical ones; ""it's just a fetish"" (since these feelings first manifested themselves as sexual fantasies), ""I could just be a crossdresser"" (and explanation that doesn't really satisfy me), and ""but you're so feminine"" (yeah sure, but man do I want to specifically be a cute BOY as opposed to a cute girl a lot sometimes). But the one that makes me the most scared is that I've somehow convinced myself that I'm trans/non-binary to fit in better with the queer or """"""s j w"""""" community. That I'm just a cis girl invading trans spaces and ""pretending"" to be one of them. I know it sounds a lot like the typical (and toxic as all hell) ""transtrenders"" argument, but I can't stop thinking about it. Especially since whenever I imagine what I would ideally like to look like when I present as a boy fits perfectly into the ""uwu soft boy"" stereotype, pastel colors and all. But I don't want to be butch. I don't want facial hair or muscles. I just what to be seen as a cute boy sometimes. I can't deny that ever since I've admitted to myself that I might be genderfluid, I started to pay more attention to my chest... Now I think about how I wish my chest was flatter, and that I was born with male genitalia instead of female. Heck, I've been wishing I was born with both mostly tbh. I don't hate being a girl, I enjoy it even but... not all the time. I don't want to completely abandon that part of me tho. If I had to guess, I think I'm in very much of a boy swing right now, if that makes any sense? (But I have no idea what pronouns to settle on) I think about this stuff daily by now, and I have no irl friends to talk to and I've been afk on and off with my buddies (who I'm not out to) on discord for so long now it's hard for me to bring myself to talk to them regularly again. I'm closeted mostly (this is an alt account I made specifically for lgbtqa+ things/anything I wouldn't want my mom to see), with super conservative parents who would never believe me. And all this is just eating away at me... At this point I'm not sure if I'm just a confused cis person, genderfluid/bi-gender, or even a feminine trans man. I'm just sure I'm hurting pretty bad right now... 

So, what do you all think? What advice, if any, do you have for me? Anything that would help me confirm my identity would help, since I have trouble dealing with uncertainty like this. Sorry in advance if anything here is hurtful or triggering! Let me if anything in here it's a bit insensitive or if I should add a content warning!

**TL;DR** : I've been questioning my gender for over six months, not having ever experienced such obvious dysphoria until now. I had a few moments in my teen years that could be hints, but never something this serious. I think I might be genderfluid/bi-gender, but I'm unsure.

I really just need to spill my guts to someone.\n\n(Might be slightly NSFW at parts, by the way)\n\nFor background: As a child, I never really experienced any dysphoria. I was happy being a girly girl, and sometimes a tomboy, not really thinking anything of my gender. I can recall a few hints, but only once I started middle school. I clearly recall envying characters like Haruhi from OHSHC (yes, very cliche) for being able to pass as both a girl and boy. I always wished I could be them. And I remember distinctly this one time my dad was driving me to school, and I thought how cool would be if I could just crossdress as a boy to school for a week and have no one know. I would fantasize what it would be like to be a boy for a day more than once throughout my teen years. Plus, I was kinda into yaoi back then (another cliche, huh?). I\'ve also struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 10 or younger, but towards the end of my teens, I felt like my medication wasn\'t helping me much anymore inexplicably. What confuses me most is that I learned about being trans and non-binary about when I was 14-15 years old on tumblr, definitions and all, yet it never clicked back then? I thought maybe I could be agender for a moment but I quickly abandoned that idea... I never understood genderfluid tho, until... well, now. The fact that none of it ever clicked and I don\'t think I ever felt blatant dysphoria is kinda messing with me. The only time I can recall having something close to dysphoria, is was when my boobs grew into size B and the first thing that came to mind is, ""Fuck, it\'s going to be harder to bind -- for crossplay of course!!"". I felt weirdly upset, despite wanting a bigger chest when I was younger... that confused me at the time.\n\nI guess I always blew it off for one big reason. I\'ve always have been into girly things, mostly in fashion. I LOVE being cute and wearing pastel colors. I love sweet lolita, fairy kei and other super feminine styles and aesthetics. For reasons like that I\'ve always felt reasonably secure in my womanhood and took pride in it even. \n\nBut thanks to one too many gay shitposts on here, I think I\'ve opened Pandora\'s box on myself. A lot of the doubts so I\'m having are the typical ones; ""it\'s just a fetish"" (since these feelings first manifested themselves as sexual fantasies), ""I could just be a crossdresser"" (and explanation that doesn\'t really satisfy me), and ""but you\'re so feminine"" (yeah sure, but man do I want to specifically be a cute BOY as opposed to a cute girl a lot sometimes). But the one that makes me the most scared is that I\'ve somehow convinced myself that I\'m trans/non-binary to fit in better with the queer or """"""s j w"""""" community. That I\'m just a cis girl invading trans spaces and ""pretending"" to be one of them. I know it sounds a lot like the typical (and toxic as all hell) ""transtrenders"" argument, but I can\'t stop thinking about it. Especially since whenever I imagine what I would ideally like to look like when I present as a boy fits perfectly into the ""uwu soft boy"" stereotype, pastel colors and all. But I don\'t want to be butch. I don\'t want facial hair or muscles. I just what to be seen as a cute boy sometimes. I can\'t deny that ever since I\'ve admitted to myself that I might be genderfluid, I started to pay more attention to my chest... Now I think about how I wish my chest was flatter, and that I was born with male genitalia instead of female. Heck, I\'ve been wishing I was born with both mostly tbh. I don\'t hate being a girl, I enjoy it even but... not all the time. I don\'t want to completely abandon that part of me tho. If I had to guess, I think I\'m in very much of a boy swing right now, if that makes any sense? (But I have no idea what pronouns to settle on) I think about this stuff daily by now, and I have no irl friends to talk to and I\'ve been afk on and off with my buddies (who I\'m not out to) on discord for so long now it\'s hard for me to bring myself to talk to them regularly again. I\'m closeted mostly (this is an alt account I made specifically for lgbtqa+ things/anything I wouldn\'t want my mom to see), with super conservative parents who would never believe me. And all this is just eating away at me... At this point I\'m not sure if I\'m just a confused cis person, genderfluid/bi-gender, or even a feminine trans man. I\'m just sure I\'m hurting pretty bad right now... \n\nSo, what do you all think? What advice, if any, do you have for me? Anything that would help me confirm my identity would help, since I have trouble dealing with uncertainty like this. Sorry in advance if anything here is hurtful or triggering! Let me if anything in here it\'s a bit insensitive or if I should add a content warning!\n\n**TL;DR** : I\'ve been questioning my gender for over six months, not having ever experienced such obvious dysphoria until now. I had a few moments in my teen years that could be hints, but never something this serious. I think I might be genderfluid/bi-gender, but I\'m unsure. But the fact that my ideal boy self is so feminine is causing me some doubts. I might need some help...', 'subreddit': 'genderfluid', 'title': 'Am I genderfluid?', 'created': 1529400217.0}"

Dysphoria is strong today. AFAB and generally present as a woman, but some days it's really difficult. I just want to bind and cut my hair short, to see the male version of myself in person instead of in my mind's eye. I can't ever fully transition because this only happens once in a while and I know the second I feel ""female"" again I'll miss my hair and curves.

Way before I knew gender-fluidity was a thing: When I was little, I wished I was Mystique from X-Men. I used to fantasize about having the ability to switch between being male or female at will.  Hell, I still fantasize about it. I can feel the switch in my mind, how it changes my attitude, my gait, the way I sit and talk. 

I almost walked into the men's restroom once because a guy walked in just before me. I said once, ""Oh hey, there's an even amount of guys and girls going to this thing, that's funny."" as a date joke, and realized I counted myself as one of the guys. In church camp I cross-dressed and ""infiltrated"" the boys side as joke, it was cringey obvious I wasn't passing, but we all had a good laugh. In high-school, people who knew me would joke that I had a male alter ego (theater was a great place to get away with cross-dressing) and I responded to both names without hesitation. I didn't mind either pronoun. Halloween, I was an ""emo guy"". Basically any opportunity I had to be male, I took. Looking back, I was very fortunately part of the theater group that was very accepting and no one ever made fun of me to my face.

I was hesitant to identify as trans, as there were times I liked being a girl and I wasn't willing to take hormones or get surgery. I was attracted to men, too. It took a long time to find someone who was interested in dating the girl-bro. I used to think, Geez, am I so boy-crazy that I want to be one of them?

I used to think I was like this because I was raised in a mostly male household. Bunch of brothers and a distant mother. My dad was very close to me, close enough to make my brothers jealous and family question if something weird went on. Nothing serious happened, but he heavily relied on me emotionally as my mom was depressed (they divorced when I was in my teens). If you want to learn more look up ""covert abuse"" or ""emotional incest"". If you feel like you are your parent's partner in the household or someone you know is, I'd suggest looking up. However mild it's good to know how it affects you in your other relationships. [Here's a good article.](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/emotional-covert-incest-when-parents-make-their-kids-partners-0914165) 

My Dad was a good person and did his best, but no one's perfect and new studies come out every year showing how certain parenting behaviors are actually bad. He didn't know what he was doing was harmful, and if he was malicious or narcissistic it could have been so much worse. He needed emotional intimacy and I was the only girl around. It made setting up emotional boundaries difficult which led to certain events in adulthood. 

So I went to therapy to deal with those events. My therapist mentioned that my gender dysphoria could be because I felt like if I was a boy, then I'd be the same as my brothers and the bad or uncomfortable and sometimes physical attention would stop. I feel like that's a possibility to my own personal journey in this. I'd like to point out that I knew that my relationship to my father was problematic before I saw my therapist, who confirmed it, but I didn't consider it could have affected my gender identity until then. Just in case someone misreads this, I'm not saying all gender identity can be due to childhood problems, just that I think mine has a strong possibility. I don't know if I would be the same if my childhood was healthier. My mom was a tomboy, and still does masculine things even if she won't admit it. She's homophobic, but when I explained gender-fluidity to her once, she said she wished there was a term like that when she was a kid. So that was interesting for me to hear. 

I know it's different for everyone, but for me when I'm a boy I feel confident and more likely to take risks. I wear looser clothes and I walk with my head up. When I feel like a girl, I feel small and I look at the ground. Some days it's a perfect mix. Either I literally don't care how I present, or I'll wear make-up but still wear my ""boy clothes"" and it feels like I'm balanced.

I've been questioning my gender for a while, but it constantly confuses me. One day I come to a conclusion, the next day 'll be like,""Wait, I should think that over again"" or,""Nah, I'm not really &lt;gender&gt;""

I've been thinking I'm something more ambiguous or flowing like genderfluid or nonbinary instead of straight up transgender because my feelings on my gender are a bit weird sometimes.

Sometimes I feel indifferent to my gender, then sometimes I feel too attached to being female. I have the weird thought too that if I was male, I would be okay with any pronoun, but being female I prefer female pronouns only I guess??

And then sometimes I question my gender for a while, then I forget about and go back to feeling cis and fine with everything, thinking,""I wouldn't mind being a guy, but I don't absolutely need to be that or anything.""

One reason I doubt that I'm really trans or anything is because one of the main reasons for questioning my gender is because I hate my female genitals when thinking of them in a sexual context. I feel like I'd feel better having sex or masturbating or having sex if I had a penis. ..but then I forget about sexual things, my libido is pretty much non existent for months, and I don't mind my female parts.

I kind of fetishize and romanticize myself as a guy too, always imagining sexual things or just a guy version of me who's nothing like me and better than me.

When I imagine myself as a guy, it doesn't feel like ""me"" really, but just something that would make me happier I guess? I feel more confident and stuff when I imagine that, but it just doesn't feel like me. I don't feel like I'm male in any way, amd I don't know if I feel all that female either, but in a way, I do?? like I definitely feel more female than male, but then I forget what that means and wonder why I'm saying I ""feel"" a gender, even though I hate those arguments that gender isn't a feeling, because I know I'm female (kind of??) because it just feels right to me?? I guess if I had to describe how my gender really feels, I feel like I'm weakly female, or like something between nonbinary and female, yet when I think about my body, I feel alright with being female, but imagining myself with a male body sounds cool to me. And yet my pronoun preference is weird, possibly being okay with anything if I was a guy (probably because I've never been one, so I'm not used to it like I am with my ASAB)  but being only comfortable with female pronouns as a girl...

This post is a mess and I probably could've written it better, but that's how I feel and it's weird and confusing. My gender in my head is female-ish, and yet I wish I had a male body, but at the same time I don't mind my female body and sometimes forget about questioning my gender and feel completely fine with being cis. I feel fake and like I'm just obsessing over a persona because being male just doesn't feel like me, but I feel confident and happier sometimes when I imagine myself as a guy. Sometimes I worry this is just a coping mechanism for my low esteem, like it;s just a character I like to imagine myself as because it's not exactly me and because being a girl has never been that important to me, yet I'm attached to it as an identity at the same time.... idfk????

When I got a bit older I still loved dolls and pink things, but I also enjoyed playing with the boys and wanted toy cars and to do sports like baseball. I went through a phase as a teenager where I felt I might be transgender and dressed as masculine as possible. I have always had issues with having breasts and a female shaped body.

112,2018-06-25 08:04:02,8tos2b,6,15,"Recently I have been trying to come to terms with myself. After indulging myself into some unhealthy means of coping with what I now suspect is repressed dysphoria (I found a way to counter it with endorphins) I have started to consider the fact that I might indeed be gender fluid. 

Now for some background, I started out crossdressing when I was about 13/14, and while initially it started out for sexual release, I soon found myself enjoying the feeling of being pretty etc. Sadly where I live, coming out as something other than gay is not exactly common (I know for a fact my parents while trying to understanding, would not be able to fully come to terms with how I feel), so for a long time I ignored what I felt and compartmentalized it. 

The dysphoria would re-appear when I am stressed, and on those days I started to use crutches to convince myself that it was all a phase/a part of an unhealthy habit I had developed. I started to work to kick the habit and have managed thankfully. 

Now around 14/15 I had stopped crossdressing period. At that point puberty hit me like a truck, and borrowing clothes from my sister felt gross and a violation of her privacy. Now that I am in my 20s and have the means to actually consider buying my own clothes, depending on how masculine or feminine I feel I find myself occasionally checking out what my female friends are wearing and feeling jealous they can pull it off. 

After reading up on gender fluidity and bi-gender people I have started to suspect I may fall on one of these specturms. I do love being a dude, and don't plan/want to transition (I have a friend who is in the process, and while I am incredibly happy for her, I do not wish to follow her path). A recent dream I had only heightened the dysphoria (In the dream I started to transition, but stopped as soon as I became androgynous. Going more in either direction felt wrong and made me hate myself). 

I have been wanting to tell someone about this for a while now, and any advice on what I might be would be appreciated.

After indulging myself into some unhealthy means of coping with what I now suspect is repressed dysphoria (I found a way to counter it with endorphins) I have started to consider the fact that I might indeed be gender fluid. \n\nNow for some background, I started out crossdressing when I was about 13/14, and while initially it started out for sexual release, I soon found myself enjoying the feeling of being pretty etc. Sadly where I live, coming out as something other than gay is not exactly common (I know for a fact my parents while trying to understanding, would not be able to fully come to terms with how I feel), so for a long time I ignored what I felt and compartmentalized it. \n\nThe dysphoria would re-appear when I am stressed, and on those days I started to use crutches to convince myself that it was all a phase/a part of an unhealthy habit I had developed. I started to work to kick the habit and have managed thankfully. \n\nNow around 14/15 I had stopped crossdressing period. At that point puberty hit me like a truck, and borrowing clothes from my sister felt gross and a violation of her privacy. Now that I am in my 20s and have the means to actually consider buying my own clothes, depending on how masculine or feminine I feel I find myself occasionally checking out what my female friends are wearing and feeling jealous they can pull it off. \n\nAfter reading up on gender fluidity and bi-gender people I have started to suspect I may fall on one of these specturms. I do love being a dude, and don't plan/want to transition (I have a friend who is in the process, and while I am incredibly happy for her, I do not wish to follow her path). A recent dream I had only heightened the dysphoria (In the dream I started to transition, but stopped as soon as I became androgynous. Going more in either direction felt wrong and made me hate myself). \n\nI have been wanting to tell someone about this for a while now, and any advice on what I might be would be appreciated. \n\n\nDisclaimer: I also plan on seeing a therapist about this someday.

118,2018-06-26 07:45:40,8ty6i6,8,6,"Hello r/Genderfluid!

I created a Reddit Account just to gain alittle knowledge about my predicament, so I hope you lovely people can help. I guess I need to supply some background information right? 

I was AMAB (Assigned Male At Birth) and have never really had a problem with it. No problems until recently that is. 

This is the most disorganized post ever but please stick with me, I'm going through alot currently. 

I've always felt different from other people, well somedays. This is really had to explain, I've never really opened up like this to anyone. I've always articulated myself in a feminine way. As a child in elementary school I remember being girly with one of my best-friends (mainly just mannerisms and dialect). No one ever commented on my femininity until middle school. This is when the ""gay rumors"" began to start, nothing too extreme. In middle school I had a group of biological females who I would always keep myself around (They seemed to accept my femininity). I never got along with many of the guys in my middle school, I just didn't gravitate to them. My feminine mannerisms became more obvious with me entering high school as a freshmen though, and of course, those ""gay rumors"" began again and never really stopped. 

You're probably asking yourself, ""Why is this person giving me an entire rundown of their life?"" Well I think you will need this information to answer my question. 

Once in high school, I began to realize that maybe I was different then the others. Not in a special snowflake sorta way either. All jokes aside.

I began to articulate my femininity in many ways: I grew out my hair, painted my nails, dressed in women's clothing, and of course, my mannerisms helped this process. This made me feel a sort of comfort with my physical body most days. Somedays I would wake up and wipe the nail polish off of my nails, almost as if to say ""you're a boy, you're not supposed to wear this."" I guess these days I would just stay quiet and dress in a sort of general manner. 

I am tremendously sorry for writing this much, I just need to get it out. 

I began to go along with the ""girly boy"" jokes and agree with them with a smile. Adopting a skinny jeans only wardrobe and a fashionable, always perfect, hairstyle. This made me happy, to just be. Be me, who I felt in that moment. 

Now, down to the interesting points. Tremendous amounts of self hate and research later. I perused the internet for a label for weirdness with myself and discovered Non-binary and Genderqueer. These two labels didn't work with me because I do feel a certain ""ways"" on different days. I feel feminine on most days and masculine on the others, and some just meh and neither (on these days I don't really care). I found this obscure label called Genderfluid and it seems to fit, but there's one problem. 

When I identify as Genderfluid, it makes me happy, momentarily, but I still feel a hole in my heart, so to speak. I still feel empty, like I haven't found myself. I've kinda developed a disliking for my male sex and have thought of gender reassignment surgery, but this seems too extreme for me. 

According to you wonder people of this Sub-Reddit, Am I Genderfluid?

Fun question, I know, you must get this one alot. 

Any advice for this self-doubting person?

119,2018-06-26 09:43:31,8typpx,17,7,"Long post, sorry, just writing down some thoughts if that's ok. I don't have many ppl I can talk to abt this.
So I saw this thread on a trans sub (I think transspace, not sure rn), abt when and how people started realising they were trans, how these feelings/thoughts manifested and what things from childhood now make more sense with the understanding of their trans selves.
I've been thinking abt that as well, recently, but with that came the reaffirming of my genderfluidity in ways that I was... not necessarily expecting. That's not to say that I wasn't sure, simply that I hadn't thought as far back as my preteens on what might have been signs.
For example, my neighbourhood friends and I used to play house and all that and I never understood why the girls wanted to play the girl part and the boys play the boy part, I just wanted to play the 'married' part, so to speak. We used to run around pretending we were animals -dogs, cats, elephants, you name it. The girls always said stuff like ""I'm a girl cat"", ""I'm a girl giraffe"" or the boys preferred playing dogs and lions and tigers bc they said those are 'boy animals', while I always just wanted to be 'a' dog, 'a' cat. This was around when I was 7-10 years old. 
Then we started play acting Sailor Moon episodes, and I always wanted to be Tuxedo Mask bc his outfit thrilled me, but I never gave his _gender_ much thought. 
Then I started drawing and the first things I drew were animals -yes, I do love animals, no I am not a furry XD- and my folks always asked me if my drawings were of a boy leopard or a girl leopard, and I kind of...distinctly remember the feeling of confusion bc, well, I didn't know. It didn't matter. It was 'a' leopard. That's all that mattered to me. 
Then when I got to drawing humans, I gravited towards switching the 'norm' between genders, as in girls would get short haircuts and determined, scowling looks, the boys I drew got colorful clothes and I really liked drawing men dancing ballet for some reason. This is obviously also a young me's interpretation of -and sort of rebellion against- the norms of the society I was raised in, but I'm just now realizing how early-on I started feeling...'different' abt genders. 
Anyways. Sorry for the long post, but I'd love to hear other people's stories. Like I said, I literally know nobody else among my friends who has experienced this, so I don't get to swap stories irl.

124,2018-06-27 01:18:37,8u5ho7,6,6,"Hi everyone! So I’m a 24 year old AMAB person who has been struggling with my gender since this past October. Basically, after wanting to crossdress since I was 11 and suppressing it, I started wearing women’s clothes last year.

Eventually, I started wearing women’s clothing in public and that was when I began to think, “Maybe I’m trans.” From that point on, the feeling kind of snowballed to a point where I really felt sure that I was a woman, and I was feeling a lot of distress ( I guess I could call it dysphoria) over my maleness. And then, suddenly it went away, and I felt male for a bit. And that lasted a few months. Then back to female, back to male, and so on. There are times when I really feel terrible about being male, and I daydream about being born a cis girl. And I think I’d be happier if I were a cis girl. I feel the dysphoria, and I imagine what could’ve been and could be. But I always reach a point where I once again feel content being male.

So, is this genderfluidity, the coming and going of dysphoria, or both? I’ve always felt uncomfortable at the idea of not being binary. Like, if I’m not binary, then I’m nothing. My therapist has told me that I care too much about being a man or a woman in the “right way”. 

I’m honestly just so tired of going back and forth. If I had to choose, I would choose for the feeling of being a woman to stay. The dysphoria sucks, but I feel better when I think of being a woman.

I enjoy showing off my feminine attributes by wearing tight cloths, particularly tight jeans. This poses a problem for be due to the fact i am a biological male. 

To put it simply, my male appendage poses a problem for me when I wear tight jeans. 

I know of methods to hide such things, like tucking, but this doesn't work for me.

Any ideas on how to hide this unwanted appendage?

This week has been an utter whirlwind for me, however the last two days have felt incredibly monumental for a couple of reasons; I came out to one of my closest friends and the dude was incredibly supportive, and for the first time in about 3 years I faced my dysphoria head on instead of burying my head in the sand.

For the first part, I was incredibly nervous. Despite knowing the dude for years I didn't really know how to tell him that I'm gender fluid as it didn't really seem like something that would come up. Through sheer luck, he brought up the topic himself while we were discussion recent events, and he made it a point to mention that he didn't care about how people identified as long as they were good people, and didn't treat him differently. I ended up telling him it was a good thing I fit both criteria since I am gender fluid. He thought I was joking at first, but when he realised I was serious he was as I mentioned, incredibly supportive and told me if I ever need to talk about it he'd be happy to listen. I freaking love the guy (platonically speaking). 

Moving onto the second part of my post, I finally did something I hadn't done in years; I ended up crossdressing. It was only for a few minutes, and I was using an old dress that hadn't been worn in years, but for the first time in literal years, I didn't feel like some random guy trying to pretend to be a woman. When I looked down I felt like a normal person and well a bit attractive. This is a huge step for me, as while I did have this feeling when I started out, over the years I subdued it to the point where it felt lost. 

Right now despite the renewed interest, I do not have any plans to start crossdressing, at least not until I move out properly and can actually afford to buy my own clothes etc, but the fact that I can do it again without feeling like a complete and utter fraud, is incredibly liberating.

I'd also just like to take a moment to thank you all again for being such an awesome community.
